<p>As a long-time fan of the extraction shooter genre, I love to see new projects enter the scene and give the top dogs a run for their money. We need more variety and more evolution within the genre. One studio that aims to shake things up is Fun Dog—an indie studio working on their first major project: The Forever Winter. I’ve been eyeing this one—especially—for a while, and now the team has finally unveiled its Early Access release date for The Forever Winter!</p>



<p>We don’t have to wait long<span>. The Forever Winter launches into Steam Early Access on&nbsp;<strong>September 24,&nbsp;</strong></span>approximately three weeks from this writing. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Declaration of War - The Forever Winter EA Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2izSjSXoq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the release date announcement, we’ll choose from one of five characters, each with a unique personality and playstyle—similar to a hero shooter, I would say. However, the core focal point of the game remains the same: We enter the battlefield as scavengers, track down loot, complete quests for either one of the warring factions, and extract before things go haywire.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as part of the announcement, the team revealed the intended price for The Forever Winter. The game will normally cost <strong>$29.99</strong>, but they’ll launch with an early adopters discount, which brings the total down to <strong>$27 for a limited time</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of popular shooters, following a rapid decline in player numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant appears to be on borrowed time</a> not long after its release!</p>

Further content will be added to the game throughout the Early Access period.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Fun Dog Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>The Forever Winter</em>, players are a scavenging survivor, leading a community of like-minded individuals who only want to be left alone. Unfortunately, AI controlled factions like <a title="Games > Europa [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/europa">Europa</a> and Eurasia control all of the world’s existing resources, and are at constant war with each other to secure more. This means the player must navigate these battlefields to collect the needed resources for their communities to survive.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Prepare for Hell</strong> – Players join up at the community hub where they can buy from vendors selling weapons, pharmaceuticals, and additional gear to prepare for the maze ahead, accept missions or dirty jobs from NPCs and rival factions and more.</li><li><strong>Player-Versus-Environment-Versus-Environment Scenario System</strong> – Enemies have their own goals and agendas, operating in coordinated groups, and undertaking full-scale battles. Enemy AI deploys enemies in squads based on their current objectives, with each squad reacting differently to player <a title="Genres > Action [2,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. As the player gets more powerful or makes a bigger mark on the battlefield, the enemy will deploy more (and stronger) firepower to counter. And players will never be stronger than the enemy.</li><li><strong>Brace the Cold Challenges Ahead</strong> – While surviving is always the primary goal, players can earn more XP, gear and money by taking on quests. Each quest has varying threat levels commensurate with their risk and reward: harder quests give larger reputation rewards that increase your faction standings, earn more credits, and get rewarded with more powerful gear.</li><li><strong>Increase Skills and Gear Up to Survive</strong> – Spend accumulated resources between sessions to level up health, speed, accuracy and reload speed that give you a fighting chance against The Forever Winter’s relentless enemies.</li><li><strong>Prioritize <a title="Genres > Stealth [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> and Teamwork</strong> – Coordinate with your squad to outsmart enemies and avoid detection to gain the upper hand, or tactically plan battles and ambushes to win guerilla engagements. Just don’t take the enemy head-on. You won’t live to tell the tale.</li><li><strong>Death is Just the Beginning (Again)</strong> – If your squad dies, the run’s over. And death is unforgiving. If you fall in battle, you’ll lose everything in your inventory for that session, and have to start over from scratch. Build up a stash back at base between sessions to keep the upper hand in the future.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Declaration of War - The Forever Winter EA Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2izSjSXoq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sometimes those are for commenting (<a href="https://aftermath.site/commenting-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have those!</a>); sometimes, for sites that are particularly prominent (or are full of themselves), they'll take the form of publicly-available editorial guidelines.</p><p>While those might <em>seem </em>necessary, I have recently encountered evidence that they can all probably be replaced by just three rules. And that any website without rules should probably institute the same three.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The evidence comes courtesy of Supper Mario Broth, the quite frankly <em>exceptional </em>social media account</a> responsible for posting all the best Nintendo trivia and tidbits. Lately they've got a little worn down after posting <a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1829026401325920713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some mildly incorrect information</a> and/or stuff that wasn't explained down to the most minute detail, which led to encounters with some of the most annoying and terrible people in the world (Nintendo pedants).</p><p>I sympathise! It's tough working with hard facts in the public eye because, as humans, we all make mistakes. And in fields where people are as weird and passionate as video games, even when you get things <em>right</em>, you might express them in a way that leads to confusion, and then you may as well have got it wrong because you'll get the same angry and abusive messages regardless.</p><p>In response, Supper Mario Broth posted this yesterday, and I don't think I've seen a better set of rules not just for a single account, but for how we should all conduct ourselves on the internet:</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After deliberating on the situation, I have decided that I do not wish to stop posting. Instead, I will implement the following NEW RULES that should address most issues with the blog and drastically reduce any stress it has been causing me. Thank you very much for your support. <a href="https://t.co/x0I222jZJ6">pic.twitter.com/x0I222jZJ6</a></p>— Supper Mario Broth (@MarioBrothBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1829014182940774742?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Perfect! Firstly, good for them, this is the best possible way to deal with the worst possible people.

			<p>Diablo IV's <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-qa-diablo-is-the-healthiest-its-been-since-launch/">next expansion</a> isn't far away, with the release date being officially set for October 8, 2024. However, before that happens, players will experience Diablo IV on the PTR (Public Test Realm) from September 4 through September 11. In this version of the PTR, players will experience the new character progression, which has experienced many changes. There are also major updates to the loot system, such as the Paragon systems and new Difficulty Tiers.</p>
<p>Those who choose to participate in the PTR for Diablo IV will be able to experience the new Class Skills and Passives and the brand-new Runeword system. If you find that you're struggling through the game in solo and don't have anyone to play with, Diablo IV will now be introducing a Party Finder tool, allowing you to team up to take down bosses and do dungeons together.</p>
<p>If you find yourself curious to know more about the Diablo IV PTR, today, developers from the game sat down during the Campfire Chat to discuss the upcoming changes and what players can expect from the PTR. The VoD is available to watch on the official Diablo YouTube Channel, where you can watch the deep dive conversation that spans over two hours.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Campfire Chat 2.0 PTR Update | August 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don't panic if you don't have the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion, as you don't need it to be able to join in the gory fun of the Diablo IV PTR unless further noted by Blizzard. However, you will get to experience the new features that are arriving to both the base game and the upcoming expansion.</p>
<p>If you experience the PTR, you can level to max level and get all of the Altar of Lilith bonuses to aid your character through the campaign. The most important experience from playing the Diablo IV PTR is utilizing the Runewords, one of the newest features in Diablo IV. There are two types of Runes called Ritual and Invocation, and you can use them to make your character more powerful.</p>
<p>Runes of Ritual specify the actions you need to take to trigger the Runes into working, whereas Runes of Invocation gives you a powerful effect once you have done the actions to trigger it. The PTR changes are huge, with many new fixes and improvements for players to explore and provide feedback. This includes the one new skill every class will receive, which can change up the builds and rotations exponentially.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know?blzcmp=blizzard-news#Runewords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the Blizzard website, which details all of the hotfixes and tweaks made to each class, provides more of the minor details.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-battlegrounds-director-discusses-the-importance-of-the-games-community<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PUBG: Battlegrounds celebrated its seventh anniversary this year, and it’s still going strong. The free-to-play battle royale shooter has welcomed millions of players from around the world during those seven years, and the development team has been focused on releasing new content and updates to keep that massive community engaged.</p><p>“The key thing that I’ve learned over the past seven years is how important fans are,” said Taehyun Kim, Production Director of PUBG: Battlegrounds. “Our game has been serviced globally and it has been played in many countries and by many people around the world. So we keep looking for ways to satisfy diverse countries and diverse fans.”</p><p>Kim has been a member of the PUBG team since its initial phase of development in 2016. He worked his way up to Production Director, where he is now responsible for guiding all aspects of the game’s progress. We got a chance to sit down and chat with him in Cologne, Germany, where he and his team were on hand for gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Throughout our discussion, Kim stressed how vital he thinks it is for developers to stay in contact with their player base. He’s even been going out of his comfort zone to engage with fans publicly in new ways.</p><p>“I had a livestream with Korean users, and it was really, really challenging,” Kim said. “I’m a developer, not a professional emcee, so I was afraid. ‘Oh, what if I make a mistake in front of this many people in real time?’ But I think, of course it is difficult, but I need to keep challenging myself and I have to continue this effort.”</p><p>That effort is one of the reasons he came to Cologne. He attended PUBG: Hot Drop Cologne, an in-person event that allowed fans to meet the game’s devs, partners, and other special guests. It was one of the first times Kim has had direct contact with Western players, which is something he wants to continue to improve at.</p><p>“I’m Korean, and I’m more comfortable speaking in Korean, so I have been communicating with Korean users using livestreaming,” he said. “But that was kind of my preparation to more effectively communicate with Western and English-speaking users. Currently we are looking forward and we are looking at different ways to more effectively communicate with our users around the world. So starting with this gamescom, we are going to keep continuing this effort to communicate with our fans.”</p><p>Of course, building a community relies on more than devs connecting with players. It’s also about allowing players to form connections with each other. August was Clan Month, which added weekly clan challenges and a new rewards system. It also allowed players to join the fan clans of eight popular esports teams. It all builds to a special tournament at the end of the month, when clan members get the chance to team up with professional players.</p><p>“For the clan system, what we want to offer to our players is to create an environment where they can create a new community and they can enjoy the game together, they can complete the missions together, and get the rewards together,” Kim said. “So doing this, they can enjoy the game with more fun with their squadmates and their clan members.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pubg-key-art-1724780420723.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kim and his team also know that for a community to stay active, they need updates and new content. He stressed that he and the dev team have a clear design philosophy and are very careful about what actually gets incorporated into the game.</p><p>“Through our communication events in Korea, I’ve learned that what is more important is not to do something big, but to do something consistently,” he said. “Our theme is survival, so we do not want to undermine this core gameplay.”</p><p>With a player base as huge and diverse as PUBG’s, player feedback comes from every corner of the world. Different players want different things, some of which directly contradict each other. So Kim and his team have to always keep that design philosophy in mind.</p><p>“For us, community feedback is very important, but we are getting a lot of feedback from many countries and from many types of users,” he said. “Sometimes, feedback is very different, even for just one feature. So we think what is important is we need to incorporate the feedback which is more relevant to our game and also we need to set a benchmark that the incorporation process should not undermine our core gameplay.”</p><p>As always, PUBG: Battlegrounds has plenty for players to look forward to. A zombie mode is on the way, an upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 is in the works long-term, and Kim said there are plans for plenty of other things that he can’t reveal yet. If you want to get in on the action, you can download PUBG: Battlegrounds for free on PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and a mobile version is available on iOS and Android.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle.967833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the actual play series <em>Dimension20</em> wrapped up a live show tour through the UK and Ireland. During this tour, they performed their latest actual play, <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em>. For those who couldn't be there in person, Dropout will be bringing the show to VOD.</p>
<h2>The Dimension20 Time Quangle VOD announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle</em> coming to VOD happened via a trailer on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi9jQrvdAuY">Dropout YouTube</a> channel. The trailer itself shows footage from different venues on the tour, showcasing both audience reactions and the performers' showmanship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=6zL3aqLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=qBGQrgmr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle </em>actual play's central gimmick is that it features characters, players, and locations from different Dimension20 series. Every show is effectively a self-contained improvised remix of <em>Dimension20</em>, with characters, locations, being shuffled around.</p>
<p>As host Brennnan Lee Mulligan says in the trailer, "What if I told you that not only do you not know who we are going to play or what setting it's in, we don't f--king know who we're gonna play or what setting it's in?"</p>
<p>It's an enticing hook since the anthology series has spanned multiple genres. They include <em>Nevermore</em> (Horror), <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fantasy High</em></a> (School Drama) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></a> (80s action movie).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the anthology-style presentation makes <em>Dimension20</em> stand out from other actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <em>Legends of Avantris</em>. The liveshow stars Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM, Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, Siobhan Thompson, and Lou Wilson as the players.</p>
<p>According to the video description, the first two shows of <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em> will be released September 12 and September 19 on the premium subscription streaming platform, Dropout. The remaining shows will be coming to the platform December 2024.</p>
<p><em>Dimension20</em> is only one major show available on Dropout. The <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/awards/dropout-emmys-game-changer-dimenson-20-ineligible-1235996243/">Emmy-nominated</a> streaming service contains extensive episodes of improvised comedy shows like <em>Make Some Noise</em> and Game Changer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231635/emudeck-machine-steam-machines-crowdfunding<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve once dreamt of building Linux-based game consoles called Steam Machines. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019#:~:text=%E2%80%94Ashley%20Carman-,23.%20Steam%20Machines,-Valve%20Corporation">They flopped</a> — but the dream eventually became reality <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">as the handheld Steam Deck</a> instead. Now, a particularly noteworthy Steam Deck enthusiast is reviving the idea of a console-sized Steam Box, one with his own retro gaming twist.</p><p>Rodrigo Sedano is the founder of <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">EmuDeck</a>, a program beloved by the Steam Deck community. It automatically installs, configures, and enhances emulators for Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and other retro consoles so they work beautifully on Valve’s handheld.</p><p>Now, he wants to make it even easier. He’s preparing to sell you a console-shaped custom gaming PC preloaded with that entire Steam + EmuDeck experience, plus a wireless controller, all ready to go. </p><p>He’s calling them EmuDeck Machines, and he’s <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">currently crowdfunding the idea on Indiegogo</a> for prices starting at around $400 — with an incredibly ambitious promise to ship them in December of this year, just four months from now. </p><p>They’ll house (weak) Intel N97 or (stronger) AMD 8600G chips in a Sega Dreamcast-inspired shell, with four USB ports around front for additional wired controllers or peripherals. By overclocking the AMD 8600G’s integrated Radeon 760M graphics, he claims he can get what looks like Steam Deck-beating performance out of his pricier $700 model:</p><div><figcaption><em>EmuDeck Machine configurations.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: EmuDeck</cite></p></div><p>There are lots of reasons to wait before putting money down on a crowdfunding campaign, though. While I love EmuDeck, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsj/details/experience/">he seems to have</a> other software design, web design, and management experience, he admits to <em>The Verge</em> that he’s never shipped a hardware product like this before. </p><p>He says his US and EU partners are telling him that getting FCC and CE certifications should only take one month. His current prototype is just a Mini-ITX board in a wooden box, while he waits for his potential case manufacturing partners in Spain to deliver the Dreamcast-shaped console case he’s dreamt up. He’s planning to assemble the PCs himself, as a family business of sorts.</p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div><p>But I think it’s at least <em>plausible</em> because he says he’s not necessarily expecting to sell more than 100 of these as a side project — and because he says these PCs will use off-the-shelf parts. It’s a standard Mini-ITX desktop motherboard and chip, in an 8.66 x 8.66 x 2.55-inch chassis. (He tells me they will have an external 155W power supply.)</p><p>Sedano says he’s been building computers since he was 14 and sees this as a hobby, too, but he’s getting serious about it in a few ways. EmuDeck is now a registered limited liability company in Spain (<a href="https://sede.registradores.org/site/mercantil?lang=en_EN">we checked</a>!), and he says he’s locked down several suppliers to make sure he’ll have the components. He’ll offer hardware support and a warranty, he claims.</p><p>He also may not need Valve’s support to make this a reality; the operating system he’s preloading <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">is Bazzite,</a> a promising fork of the SteamOS interface with a different underlying operating system (Fedora). I’ve loaded it on a Lenovo Legion Go and the ROG Ally X at this point, and I’ve been mostly impressed by how well it works. Bazzite founder Kyle Gospodnetich tells me his team gave EmuDeck their blessing, though Bazzite isn’t currently helping EmuDeck tweak the software.</p><p>It’s a little surprising we haven’t seen many Steam Boxes like this before, and Bazzite says it isn’t aware of any others in the works. Perhaps other companies have been waiting on Valve? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=Valve%20hopes%20the%20Steam%20Deck%20will%20inspire%20new%20Steam%20Boxes%2C%20too">The Steam Deck maker told us in late 2022</a> that it’s actually excited for other manufacturers to make small SteamOS PCs — after Valve releases a general image of SteamOS 3 for those manufacturers to use. </p><p>As of this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">there are signs</a> that Valve’s getting closer.</p><p>If you’d rather tinker instead of looking for a turnkey console gaming experience, you could of course build your own Bazzite box with EmuDeck. Or, add an HDMI dock or hub to a handheld. Or, you could possibly even do <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLnxj1ltd5vk">what YouTuber ETA Prime did</a> and turn an old Steam Deck into a mini PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Excited for 2024’s RLCS World Championship? The massive Rocket League event is just around the corner, and competitors are gearing up to take on one another in what will be some of the most intense car-soccer action fans will ever see. </p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about RLCS World Championship 2024, including its prize pool, dates and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-prize-pool">RLCS World Championship 2024 Prize Pool</h2>



<p>This year’s RLCS has a massive prize pool of $1,165,500 for which the 16 qualifying teams will be competing for. Here is the official prize pool split:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st:</strong> $300,000</li>



<li><strong>2nd: </strong>$150,000</li>



<li><strong>3rd-4th:</strong> $99,000</li>



<li><strong>5th-6th:</strong> $84,000</li>



<li><strong>7th-8th:</strong> $66,000</li>



<li><strong>9th-11th:</strong> $42,000</li>



<li><strong>12th-14th:</strong> $22,500</li>



<li><strong>15th-16h:</strong> $12,000</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of this massive prize pool, the winners of the RLCS World Championship will also be able to hold high the historic World Championship Trophy. </p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-official-dates">RLCS World Championship 2024 Official Dates</h2>



<p>Curious as to when the RLCS World Championship 2024 is? <strong>The event, which will be taking place at Dickies Arena in Forth Worth, Texas, will be taking place from September 10-15.</strong></p>



<p>With the event inching closer and closer to fruition, many fans are getting excited to see their favorite teams compete against one another, but what teams are actually competing?</p>



<h2 id="h-teams">Teams</h2>



<p>The RLCS World Championship has 16 teams competing this year. Here is a list of everything team competing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gentle Mates Alpine</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Karmine Corp</li>



<li>G2 Stride</li>



<li>Gen.G Mobil1 Racing</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>OG</li>



<li>PWR</li>



<li>QuikTrip Pioneers Gaming</li>



<li>FURIA Esports</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Anything</li>



<li>Gaimin Gladiators</li>



<li>Limitless</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-format">Format</h2>



<p>For this year’s format, we get to see eight teams from the bottom 16 seeds compete against the top eight seeds. Although, there will still be a Swiss stage, where all 16 teams will compete against each other. </p>



<p>The top eight Swiss teams will then be seeded into a single-elimination bracket. What is interesting in this year’s tournament, is the top four Swiss teams will start with two chances before the final four, where teams ranked 5th-8th will only have one life when competing. </p>



<p>That extra life definitely gives the top four Swiss teams a heavy advantage, adding quite a bit of pressure against the other teams. This tournament series is already looking to be incredibly competitive.</p>

Because of that, they claimed, Black Myth: Wukong had not been able to pass bug detection tests and was thus delayed indefinitely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, IGN understands that no tech issue that would delay Black Myth: Wukong has been reported to Xbox. Rather, the Xbox delay is the result of an exclusivity deal neither Game Science nor Sony have publicized, the source said. The source described the rumors of tech issues on Xbox as "inaccurate."</p><p>IGN has reached out to both Game Science and Sony for comment on these reports.</p><p>The new information follows a series of confusing rumors and contradictary statement stretching back to June. Observers first noted the delay when Xbox Series X|S vanished from the Black Myth: Wukong trailer shown during Summer Game Fest. In its <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>, Game Science said that it was still optimizing the Xbox version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>"We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards," Game Science's FAQ read.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-addresses-black-myth-wukongs-delay-on-xbox-series-xs">Microsoft released its own statement</a> on June 21, saying, "We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</p><h2>Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster</h2><p>The rumors of a tech issue were fueled in part by Baldur's Gate 3's Xbox saga in 2023, which saw the Xbox version delayed until December due to difficulties optimizing for Xbox Series S. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-reveals-impressive-optimization-efforts-for-xbox-series-s-port-of-baldurs-gate-3">Larian was eventually forced to remove split-screen co-op from the Xbox Series S version</a> in order to get Baldur's Gate 3 to Microsoft's platform.</p><p>The rumors were given further credence by the fact that Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">our review noting that its fidelity was enough to even make a top-end rig with an RTX 4090 sweat</a>. Game Science has apologized for any tech problems players encountered, and today <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-patch-10814860-makes-some-crucial-fixes-and-nerfs-one-boss-in-particular">released a 1.6 GB patch with various fixes and adjustments</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One way or another, Black Myth: Wukong is doing just fine, pushing Steam to an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-lifts-steam-to-37-million-concurrent-players-for-first-time">incredible 37 million concurrent players</a> for the first time earlier this week.

The developer revealed Runewords as an expansion-exclusive feature that will let players combine runes in order to essentially craft new abilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9zeqdMF-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To create a Runeword, players will need to combine a Rune of Ritual and a Rune of Invocation. These effectively serve as a resource generator and a resource spender, respectively. The Rune of Ritual will specify a type of action that must be done in order to activate it, with an example being casting a skill with a cooldown. Fulfilling that Rune of Ritual will generate a new resource, Offering, which is then used in turn to activate the Runeword's Rune of Invocation. If a player has more Offering than what the Rune of Invocation requires, they gain Overflow, which grants that Runeword bonus effects that are proportional to the amount of Overflow.</p><p dir="ltr">Only two Runewords will be equipable at a time, and they will use the same sockets that currently are used for gems. The same Runeword can't be equipped twice, and there are three rarities of each rune, with higher rarities being more powerful. Runes can be acquired throughout the Vessel of Hatred expansion, but there will be a specific area, The Undercity, where players can farm for them as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The powers gained from Runewords can have a variety of effects. One Runeword, for example, will grant players access to the Sorcerer's Teleport ability. Another will channel the Druid's Petrify skill, stunning enemies and increasing damage dealt to them. In total, Blizzard said each class will have two skills and one Legendary Aspect represented in the pool of possible Runewords.</p><p dir="ltr">Runes can also be used for crafting. Combining three of the same Rune will create a new rune, with a chance of it rolling at a higher rarity. Runes in conjunction with a Resplendent Spark can also be used to craft certain Mythic Unique items, giving players yet another way to obtain some of the game's most sought after items.</p><p dir="ltr">Runewords are just one of the new features coming in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion on October 8</a>.

Red Thread Games’ adventure/rhythm/beat-em-up hybrid has its strengths, and when it’s functioning as a socially conscious, modern version of a Telltale Games adventure, the lives of its merry band of superpowered misfits are genuinely engrossing. When it tries to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273">below-average beat-em-up</a></span> that trades relationship-building for some of the flimsiest action combat I’ve experienced this side of the Wii era, however, I’m less enthralled.</p><p><em>Dustborn </em>feels as if it’s trying to explore too many things, making the end result come off like a rough draft of every possible idea the team had for the game. It’s filled to the brim with mechanics, characters, and themes that sometimes feel contrived and underbaked, as if they were an idea someone wanted to incorporate whether the game had the bandwidth to incorporate it thoughtfully or not. Its cast of (mostly) superpowered nomads is as diverse in background and culture as you’d expect of a group growing larger as it travels across a dystopian America, but as their tour bus fills up, it becomes clear not every character is going to get the same room to grow as others.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-recommend-id="image://6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-recommend-id="image://6d8d8ae2f3233da779449cb80c84cb52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo scratches his chin while Pax and others stand behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was around midway through <em>Dustborn</em> that I realized not all characters were created equal. Pax, the hero of our story, meets nearly a dozen people who join her and her friends’ cross-country road trip, and at the start, each of these characters has a distinct path you can set them on depending on your choices. For example, Theo, the boss of this group of mutant smugglers making their way across America, can end up viewing Pax and her crew as his equals, his employees, or as surrogate children by the end of <em>Dustborn</em>. The game is constantly reminding you that some of his responses are determined by how you’ve been treating him throughout the game, and will ultimately culminate in a specific ending based on your relationship. It’s an interesting, albeit on-the-nose, way of letting you see how the way you treat someone can affect their worldview.<br></p><p>However, this mechanic is never implemented for cast members who show up in the second half of the game. Instead, those less malleable characters end up feeling like narrative devices designed to get Pax and friends out of a sticky situation or manufacture drama that never actually materializes, and they ultimately feel like little more than an idea that wasn’t cooked long enough. This problem extends beyond the game’s character writing and bleeds into a story that cannot seem to pick a lane.</p><p><em>Dustborn</em> starts out straightforward enough. Pax, her friend Sai, and her ex Noam are all working with a man named Theo as an undercover punk band smuggling a data key across an alt-future version of America. In this world, President John F. Kennedy wasn’t the one killed in his 1963 assassination attempt. Instead, it was his wife Jackie Kennedy who lost her life, and in reaction to this loss, the president founded Justice, a policing force that descended into fascism, especially when targeting “Anomals,” superpowered individuals who can affect different elements with their voice. For example, Pax can create negative feelings with her vocals whereas Noam can calm a heightened situation. The group has to make it across the country undetected in order to finish the job and reach a better life.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-recommend-id="image://6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-recommend-id="image://6f11acb5fec7fb2122be3f8f240061ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax looks at a sign depicting an older JFK repping Justice For America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That in and of itself is a strong enough foundation for this road trip, but every time Pax’s tour bus stopped, I knew I was going to meet another character, find out about some other layer to the country-wide conspiracy our heroes are contending with, or learn something new about this crew. By the time I was halfway across America, <em>Dustborn </em>already felt like it was caving under the weight of its ambition. It’s clear the team wanted to touch on different cultures, conflicts, themes, relationships, and character archetypes, but every time it expanded its focus I could feel it losing sight of the strong baseline it had already established. Eventually, the grounded stories started to feel like they were getting lost in the noise.<br></p><p>There are parts of <em>Dustborn </em>I don’t think I could even coherently describe to you because they came and went so fast I don’t think I quite got what the game was going for. Entire sections feel like detours to a different story that wasn’t finished, with constant escalations and deescalations of stakes and giant lore drops that feel disconnected from moment to moment. <em>Dustborn</em> is at its best when it’s examining how a group of persecuted people navigate the cynical endgame of a fascist America and still try to find hope and connection. So often, those ideas are derailed by ineloquent genre-blending that never pays off. Entire characters are swallowed whole in the final moments as they get fed into the gaping maw of convoluted turns <em>Dustborn</em> takes, and I’m left wondering why the game had to balloon into this cluttered katamari of disparate elements when it was already doing enough.</p><figure id="" data-id="34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-recommend-id="image://34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-recommend-id="image://34a50a22b04e341e693d67e344c7e7c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax holds a bat on her shoulder over a broken robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I wrestle with the big picture because I really, <em>really</em> enjoyed the smaller moments in <em>Dustborn</em>. Before it started adding characters for characters’ sake, it<em> </em>had me wrapped around its finger as I watched sisters reconnect, downtrodden people find hope within each other, and a group of oppressed people fight for their freedom in an unjust world. Those were the moments that kept me going when a new contrivance or convoluted twist derailed what I was here to see. But ultimately, those were the least intrusive parts of <em>Dustborn</em>, as the combat remains the most egregious things the game adds on top of its already too-full plate. It’s annoyingly imprecise, its bells and whistles from Pax’s arsenal of vocal attacks don’t add enough interesting flair to give the game its own identity, and the only real redeeming part of it is that it gives you the option right out the gate to do it less.<br></p><p>The game’s rhythm sequences, in which you play as the titular Dustborn punk band, fare a bit better and are challenging enough, but I never looked forward to them because I frankly found the music lacking. Maybe that was intentional, considering Dustborn is just a cover for a smuggling operation, but I’m not booting any of these songs up on Spotify. <em>Dustborn</em> constantly bites off more than it can chew, even for quick gags like an entire turn-based battle sequence that pays homage to RPG classics. It’s not even that these ideas are inherently unsound, it’s that the execution never matches the highs of its relationship writing.</p><figure id="" data-id="ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-recommend-id="image://ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-recommend-id="image://ebf23891df2a908121254fe0d91ce09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dustborn hovers over an injured Pax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I feel like I’ve spent the majority of this review dogpiling on a game I mostly enjoyed. Maybe that’s because I’m frustrated by the squandered potential smothered under a pile of excess, like someone unwilling to say “when” to the person holding the Olive Garden cheese grater. Part of me feels like I need a game like <em>Dustborn </em>right now; one that believes that people joining together can change the world and that despite how fucked everything is around them, there is still something to fight for. I think as I’ve gotten older, I’ve started backsliding into the same cynicism I felt as a teenager. I’ve watched the world get worse around me as those who held me up have been beaten down just as hard. How long must we stand together and fight against systems that would rather we lay down and die before things change? How much fight do I have left in me to find out? Large parts of <em>Dustborn </em>poked at my anxiety about the state of the world, and despite its unabashed belief that Pax and her friends could make the world a better place, I feel myself becoming more jaded at the notion. Perhaps the world, much like <em>Dustborn</em>, isn’t as easily definable as good or bad, just full of good people trying to make the most of the situation they’re in. I want to believe as much as the game does, and maybe that belief is enough for me to look past its overambition.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're familiar with the name EmuDeck, you're likely a Steam Deck owner looking for <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">an easy and user-friendly way to run emulators on your Steam Deck handheld</a>. Now, <a href="https://github.com/dragoonDorise">one of the coders</a> behind that software suite is dipping their toes into branded gaming hardware with <a href="https://x.com/EmuDeck/status/1829172047559397518">the EmuDeck Machines project</a>, now seeking <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">funding on IndieGogo</a>.</p>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines obviously come with EmuDeck software preinstalled to let users easily "play your retro games from your couch." But they also promise to let you run games from Steam and other popular PC launchers through the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Linux-based, gaming-focused Bazzite OS</a>. The vibe is definitely similar to that of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's own aborted Steam Machines effort</a> from years back, albeit in a less "official" capacity.
</p><p>"I used to be a PC guy but in the last 20 years I switched to the Mac and in the Apple ecosystem choosing a computer is easy," project lead DragoonDorise told Ars in an email. "But then I found myself wanting a gaming rig so I started my search and boy oh boy I was lost. The PC industry seems to be trying to trick you every step of the way, gazillions of options, hard to understand what's good and what's not. If you are tech savvy it's not hard, you know what to get and what to avoid. Then it hit me, I made emulation easy with EmuDeck, why not make hardware easy too?"</p>
<p>"The idea behind the EmuDeck Machine is to make hardware easy just as EmuDeck did with software," DragoonDorise <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/this-is-emudeck-110939776">writes on the EmuDeck Patreon</a>. "This is not focused to tech savvy people. It's for people that want a no-hassle experience, just buy and play," they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6751/">added on Reddit</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>What’s inside?</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckspecs.jpg" data-height="1420" data-width="1350" alt="The EM1 is tuned for older emulators and games, while the EM2 promises to run more recent software."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/emudeckspecs.jpg" data-height="1420" data-width="1350">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The EM1 is tuned for older emulators and games, while the EM2 promises to run more recent software.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EmuDeck Machines come in two promised configurations. On the low-end EM1 model, a $365 early bird price gets you an Intel N97-based system with 8GB of RAM and no dedicated graphics card. That's enough to run a game on the order of <em>Hades</em> at a smooth 60 fps and run emulators of systems through the PS2/Wii era.</p>
<p>Upgrading to the $676 EM2 gets you an overclocked Radeon 760M GPU and an upgrade to 16GB of RAM. That promises smooth gaming performance for high-end games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Returnal</em>, according to DragoonDorise, as well as support for PS3 and Xbox 360 emulators. If the Indiegogo project is fully funded, DragoonDorise also promises an optional Docking Station will be made available next year to provide "Radeon 7600" graphics power to the EM2.</p>
<p>Both models come with 512GB of storage, which can be upgraded with external USB hard drives and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMCPY4VG/?tag=arstech20-20">Gamesir wireless controller</a>. It all comes packaged in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6ad2/">8.6-inch square case</a> that's clearly inspired by the Sega Dreamcast, with four USB ports where the usual controller ports would be.</p>
<h2>Caveat emptor</h2>
<p>Though DragoonDorise says they currently only have a "working prototype" of the EmuDeck Machines, the IndieGogo project promises an ambitious schedule where hardware will be shipping by December. "The only thing I'm missing right now is the shell, all the rest is already taken care of, " DragoonDorise told Ars. "Where I'm gonna get my components, cables, etc. all of that is already spoken for. And the times I posted in IGG are according what my manufacturer told me. If we end up having any delay I'll just be transparent with my backers."</p>
<p>Should potential backers worry that a software coder is pivoting to hardware for the first time? "I have experience with distribution as I used to run an online store back in the day selling hundreds of devices per month," DragoonDorise tells Ars. "I've never been on the side of the manufacturer, though, but you know what? When I started coding EmuDeck the most I knew about Linux was how to change directories and little more and that ended up being a big success because I cared about the project, I believed it could be something that people will love to use. This is the same, my heart is poured in this thing."</p>

<p>Overall, though, DragoonDorise's comments make the EmuDeck Machines effort sound more like a fun hobby than an attempt at an ongoing business. "This is a project I'm doing mostly for fun, just like EmuDeck," they told Ars. "I built a mini ITX PC... and I thought, 'Hey this is cool, let's do this,'" they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj5dya/">wrote on Reddit</a>. "I've always dream[ed] of making a video console, so this it," they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6n1l/">continued in another Reddit comment</a>.
</p><p>As of this writing, the EmuDeck Machines effort has attracted nearly $13,000 in pledges in just under 24 hours. But DragoonDorise tells Ars he's making just $50 on each unit sale, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmuDeck/comments/1f44lgx/comment/lkj6k61/">writes on Reddit</a> that they're "not trying to get rich here with this, I'm not even expecting to make money. I'm doing this because I think [it] is a fun project and I thought people would like it."</p>
<p>In the Patreon comments, DragoonDorise adds that they tried to make the machines affordable for customers, but that "Indiegogo takes a big cut... they are going to make more money than I will."</p>
<p>For fans of the EmuDeck software, DragoonDorise also promises on Patreon that work on EmuDeck Machines hardware "doesn't mean things will change on the software side of EmuDeck, if anything it will bring more features." In fact, features like <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/emudeck-2-2-3-2-96522491">CloudSync</a>, <a href="https://emudeck.github.io/tools/steamos/steam-rom-manager/">ROM Library</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/EmuDeck/EmuDecky">the EmuDecky plugin</a> were added to EmuDeck "because I envisioned the EmuDeck Machine with those features so many months ago," they write, "and those have ended up being in the regular EmuDeck for every one of you."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> will receive some huge changes alongside its Vessel of Hatred expansion, changes that include a complete restructuring of the game's difficulty system and its endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed during a recent (very lengthy) livestream, Blizzard has announced World Tiers, Diablo 4's current difficulty system, will be removed. In their place will be a system that is much more similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>. Players will journey through Normal, Hard, Expert, and Penitent difficulty before reaching the start of the endgame at Torment 1 difficulty. Each difficulty will see players earn additional XP and gold.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9zeqdMF-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Unlocking the new Torment difficulties will be tied directly to progressing through the Pit endgame activity introduced in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn update</a> earlier this year. There will be four Torment difficulties in total, with each difficulty representing a significant increase in challenge. Players will only be able to unlock Torment 1 after conquering Pit Tier 20, after which subsequent difficulties will be unlocked every 15 Pit Tiers. The highest level of the Pit will be Tier 100, but each tier will be more challenging than in the current version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Torment difficulty will be where players start to find the best items. Sacred items will be removed entirely, while Ancestral items are being reworked to only drop at Torment difficulties and to be more rare. However, they will also be much more powerful, as they will have a guaranteed Greater Affix stat and feature more potent Legendary powers. Higher Torment tiers will reward more Ancestral items, rewarding players who push the game's highest difficulties.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the game's difficulty changes are to make Diablo 4 feel more consistent across its various content, instead of the difficulty varying wildly in the current version of the game depending on what endgame activity you are pursuing.</p><p dir="ltr">The difficulty changes will go hand-in-hand with upcoming changes to leveling and the Paragon system in Diablo 4. The level cap come Update 2.0 will be reduced to 60 (down from 100), while Paragon points unlocked through leveling will be shared across all characters on a realm i.e., the Eternal, Hardcore, and Seasonal realms. As players predicted, this will coincide with a numbers value squish for damage and health, making the game more readable instead of bosses having trillions of health and players dealing billions of damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will actually be able to earn more Paragon points come the update, but there will be a five Paragon board limit. Blizzard said this change is to encourage players to fill out each board more, instead of simply rushing to each Glyph node. Each class will receive a new board, and each existing board will be rebalanced accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">With the release of Vessel of Hatred, Paragon Glyphs will be upgraded by doing the Pit instead of Nightmare dungeons (which will instead reward Masterwork materials). Instead of an XP system used to level up Glyphs, it will instead be a chance or fail system, where players will have a guaranteed chance to upgrade their Glyph if completing a Pit tier 10 levels or more higher than the Glyph's current level and a less than 100% chance when completing lower level Pit tiers. Glyphs will have a new max rank of 100, and will see a radius increase at rank 15 and 46. Rank 46 will also upgrade the Glyph to a Legendary Glyph, after which it will gain a powerful, multiplicative stat bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">All of those changes will be in addition to Vessel of Hatred's new class, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">the Spiritborn</a>, new skills for each class, the return of Mercenaries, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">addition of runewords from Diablo 2</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">group-based endgame dungeon, the Dark Citadel</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred releases October 8</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna have announced a strategic partnership, which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertainment, said<em> “At Remedy, our primary focus continues to be what we do best—crafting industry-defining video games that have earned us global recognition. Now, the time is right to expand the reach of Remedy’s beloved franchises to an even broader global audience through film, television, and more. In Annapurna, we have found an outstanding partner who shares our ambition and passion for immersive storytelling. We are excited to see them bring the universes and characters we have created to life in new mediums, thanks to this unique deal.”&nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>“The future of storytelling requires seamlessly integrating gaming, film, and television, and this partnership will allow us to explore new ways of bringing these narratives to life,”</em> said Megan Ellison, Founder and CEO of Annapurna. <em>“By leveraging Remedy’s innovative narratives and immersive worlds, we can push the boundaries of how stories are told and experienced across mediums.”</em></p>
<p>Previously, Remedy had a co-development partnership for Control 2 with 505 Games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/28/remedy-acquires-the-rights-to-the-control-series-from-505-games-includes-control-2-and-condor/">Remedy acquired the rights to the Control series from 505 Games</a>, which included Control 2 and the co-op project Concord. In May, Remedy did announce the cancellation of another co-op game that had the codename<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-title-project-kestrel/"> Project Kestrel</a>, and this was in development with Tencent as a partner.</p>

<p>There have been attempts in the past to bring Alan Wake to the movie screen before, stretching all the way back to 2010. And back in 2020, Gary Whitta expressed interest in writing a script for a Control movie, though this has not gone anywhere. Who knows? Maybe Gary will get the call up to write the movie now.</p>
