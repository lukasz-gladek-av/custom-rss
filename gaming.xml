            <p>Warner Bros are closing three video game development studios as they seek "to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy", according to a leaked staff memo from Warner Bros head of games and streaming JB Perrette. The three studios in question are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> developer Player First Games, free-to-play specialists Warner Bros Games San Diego, and Monolith, the 30-year-old studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-one-lives-forever">No One Lives Forever</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, and a troubled forthcoming Wonder Woman adaptation that has now been cancelled.</p><!--more-->
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring">broke the story last night</a>, and Warner Bros have now confirmed the studio closures and Wonder Woman's cancellation in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>. "We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -- Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones," they say. This "strategic change in direction" is "not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them".</p>
<p>As for Wonder Woman, the company's "hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." The release concludes with the rousing note that "as difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond."</p>
<p>The closures continue a terrible couple of years for Warner Bros, who have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-says-it-plans-to-transform-its-biggest-franchises-into-live-service-games">doubled down</a> on live service adaptations of their many licenses, but struggled to convince players in sufficient droves. The big recent disaster was Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a>, a handsome but creaky game-as-service extravaganza reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">imposed on a studio known for rich single player fare</a>, which has lost Warner Bros hundreds of millions of dollars. Following the latter failure, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">announced</a> that he would depart the company this January, after 12 years as boss.</p>
<p>JP Perrette comments a little on all this in the leaked staff memo, circulated by Bloomberg. "The quality of too many of our new releases has really missed the mark," he wrote. "We need to make some substantial changes to our portfolio/team structure if we are to commit the necessary resources to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy."</p>
<p>Player First Games are arguably the saddest victim of Warner's cuts - founded in 2019 and acquired by Warner Bros in July 2024 off the back of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">an initially positive response</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">now-shuttered</a> Smash Brother-from-another-mother MultiVersus, a whole six or seven months before getting axed. I also feel for Warner Bros. Games San Diego, who had yet to release a single game. But I grieve most of all for Monolith.</p>
<p>I had sort of assumed that Monolith would never be closed, because how could you close the studio who gave us F.E.A.R., Condemned and Shadow Of Mordor. It's been a while since those releases and I'm sure many of the team members have long since moved on, but their legacy is infectious. F.E.A.R. is the definitive Matrix FPS: its rippling bullet trails and gusts of muzzle smoke have become something of an indie shooter subgenre, revisited by swaggering upstarts like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">Trepang</a>. Condemned is perfectly atrocious in its Finchery pipe-wielding cellar fights. And Shadow Of Mordor is the game that lifted the Orcs out of interchangeability and procedurally transformed them into amazing, evolving archvillains.</p>
<p>Monolith's Wonder Woman appears to have been living on borrowed time for a while - announced in 2021, it had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">reportedly</a> "struggled to coalesce" amid leadership changes and project reboots, costing Warner $100 million in the process. Still, there was cause for some hope. While it seems likely the game would have been afflicted by the same live service rot as Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-mordor-studio-are-making-a-wonder-woman-game-with-the-nemesis-system">once planned</a> to make use of Shadow Of Mordor's Nemesis system.</p>
<p>Warner Bros have yet to announce how many jobs will be lost in the course of the studio closures. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/la-quimera-former-metro-devs-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A series of articles that were seemingly posted too early have revealed a new studio founded by former Metro developers from 4A Games. The studio, dubbed ‘Reburn’, is developing a futuristic sci-fi shooter that looks as though it could be straight out of the Killzone series. It’s named ‘La Quimera’, and an announcement trailer for the game was <strong>almost </strong>grabbed by eagle-eyed users.</p>



<p>Instead, we have a series of screencaps to go on. These images showcase an attractive, intense first-person shooter, the origins of which are hard to pinpoint. One screenshot shows the player character fighting with soldiers who have bright orange eyes on their helmets, which utterly smacks of Killzone, the long-abandoned PlayStation FPS series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-out-of-nowhere">From Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>La Quimera translates directly from Spanish to English as ‘The Chimera’. That’s a mythological monster created by combining elements from multiple creatures, which immediately gives La Quimera a kind of ‘experiment gone wrong’ vibe. The game’s story has reportedly been penned by Nicolas Winding Refn (<em>Drive</em>, <em>The Neon Demon</em>).</p>



<p>One Spanish-speaking publication revealed several details about the game. First, it’s set ‘in a Latin American megalopolis’, </p>



<p>The screenshots that were captured and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-metro-series-devs-form-new-game-studio-reburn-reveal-new-sc-fi-shooter-la-quimera-trailer.1118565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on ResetEra</a> showcase a futuristic first-person shooter that could be Killzone 4 if you weren’t privy to this news.</p>



<p>In the post on ResetEra, users shared several screenshots that reveal what looks like a remarkable game at first blush. From hulking, animalistic robot enemies to dramatic showdowns between what looks like a resistance group and heavily armoured soldiers, a lot of lore is already being established for La Quimera.</p>



<p>In some scenes, we get a look at a world that appears to be somewhat devastated and overgrown, suggesting some post-apocalyptic vibes might be present. That theme fits perfectly into the wheelhouse of these developers, given that they worked on Metro.</p>



<p>There’s also a title splash that reveals the player character, an armoured individual reminiscent of a Halo Spartan or ‘Prophet’ from the Crysis series. This title splash suggests the game is only coming to PC platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-imminent-reveal">Imminent Reveal</h2>



<p>It has been claimed that La Quimera is an ‘ambitious’ game that fuses ‘exoticism and Latin folklore’ with ‘weapons and technology of the future’. The ‘Metro touch’ is front and centre from the 110 developers working on the project, many of whom have acquired experience from years of working at 4A Games.</p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s set to be a narrative-driven adventure playable either solo or in a group of up to four players.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Reburn plans to fully reveal La Quimera, but given that at least three outlets have their hands on a trailer and screenshots, it could be any day now. Studios and publishers will rarely share content like this too long before an announcement is made, for <strong>this very reason that we’re discussing</strong>.</p>



<p>Remember – <strong>it’s not confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this content is all subject to change.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think about La Quimera? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map.1119108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of the global success of Marvel Rivals and with other popular live-service games like Naraka: Bladepoint and Once Human under its belt, NetEase has turned its attention to the hero shooter genre with FragPunk. New internal development team Bad Guitar Studio is made up of young, hardcore FPS fans, and after joining them for a one-hour play session where we tried a new character and map revealed exclusively in this preview, the team’s eye for detail is clear to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk’s main game mode is the 5v5 Shard Clash mode. On its surface, this mode resembles your typical Overwatch-like hero shooter skirmish, but it also pulls from a variety of influences to mix up the gameplay. The rounds in this mode are closer to the bomb-defusal objectives of Counter Strike, with one team planting bombs at specified locations and the other defending, with relatively small arenas that keep rounds tight and focused.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any hero shooter, players can choose from a selection of characters – named Lancers – who each have a selection of unique skills, meaning plenty to learn in terms of individual character preferences and team makeup. For our session, we tried the newly unveiled character Chum, a stone robot who is accompanied by a mechanical pet angler fish named Chomper. In addition to using the game’s arsenal of satisfying guns, Chum can toss projectiles similar to sticky mines and smoke grenades, as well as sending Chomper out as support. Chomper can track and bite enemies for multiple low-damage attacks, essentially like a walking turret, or can be modified with pet treats that make it explode on contact or trail a thick smokescreen in its wake, adding several strategic layers that felt fun to mix up. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Chum is a stone robot who is accompanied by a mechanical pet angler fish named Chomper.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And being made of stone, Chum is also a strong defence character, making him a great all-round option for newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many other Lancer abilities are not only offensive but defensive or tactical – walls for cover, traps, speed boosts, skills that highlight enemies on the map, and so on. We tried several Lancers, and found a varied effect on gameplay. Using Nitro, with her directly-controllable four-legged drone and gun turrets, we were able to rack up multiple assists; while Axon was another favourite thanks to his more aggressive selection of skills, including projectile bombs and a cool guitar-gun. In the Lancer selection screen, you can watch a short video clip for each ability to help you quickly grasp what they do. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FragPunk Screenshots and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what really sets FragPunk apart is its Shard Cards system. At the start of each round, each team is randomly assigned a set of three cards, which they can swap in and out, each of which changes the rules of the round for your entire team. Some are simple stat percentage boosts or buffs, while others do things like increasing the size of your enemies’ heads, decreasing your own or equipping helmets, affecting the difficulty of headshots for that round. Others still are much more unusual, and completely change the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, one Shard Card gave our team a kind of proximity detector so that we got an aural and visual signal whenever an enemy was nearby, while another slowly regenerated our health gauge, both of which gave us a welcome advantage. Some cards affect the environment, such as shrouding the map in fog that adds tension as enemies are harder to spot. Others have active effects – press the Z key to swap health bars with an enemy, or to swap gear with them, or to jump into a parallel world where you can essentially run unseen to a new location and then pop back into the fight to ambush your foes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fragpunk - Dongtian Map</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a lot to take in. You only have around 30 seconds to finalise your hand for each round, and at first each of the 150+ cards will be new to you. “We deliberately made the rule for each card as simple as possible so that they can be quick to understand,” Creative Director Xin Chang told us. “We also made the description text for each card as short as possible, and used visual design to make its effects more obvious.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The ruleset-shuffling Shard Cards were inspired not only by other videogames, but also by sports. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few rounds, the Shard Cards system began to make sense, and really paid off in terms of making each round feel different. We were forced to engage differently with every round, rethinking strategies and responding not only to our team’s current hand but also the enemy team’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the ruleset-shuffling Shard Cards were inspired not only by other videogames, but also by sports. The development team’s building has a large gymnasium with facilities for activities such as basketball, table tennis and badminton, its walls adorned with photos of the developers in competition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FragPunk Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chang explained, “I play soccer and basketball, so I like games with a two-team system. I also watch a lot of NBA, and they often make changes to the rules to keep the sport interesting. Based on that idea, I also wanted to have a system of tweaking the rules in our game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports also influenced the team’s approach to FragPunk’s maps. Level Designer An Yuan added, “In level design, we divide the map into areas that are good for attack or defence phases, so that the player has to keep moving. It’s kind of like basketball, where you have different spatial design around the court that suits the different roles of the players. We applied that concept in our game, and also in the Shard Cards, which can turn a good hiding place into a bad one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk also features a Duel mode. When a match ends in a tie, it changes to a one-on-one showdown, a little bit like the mano a mano face-offs in Call of Duty: Warzone’s Gulag, but inspired by soccer’s penalty shootouts. Each player takes their turn in the queue for a series of short and sharp winner-stays-on rounds in small but vertically layered arenas. With all our teammates spectating during our turn, we totally felt the pressure, making for a fun and different tie-breaker mini-game. It’s so cool, the devs even added it as a separate standalone mode called Duel Master.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each map has interactive gimmicks that players can use strategically to gain the upper hand. First, we tried the newly unveiled map Dongtian. This is the Hangzhou, China-based dev team’s stab at an Asian-flavoured map, and its two bomb sites can be rotated by players for tactical advantage. When the switch in the middle of the map is activated by a player, the core cover at the bomb site rotates, altering strategies for both the offensive and defensive teams.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each map has interactive gimmicks that players can use strategically to gain the upper hand. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to use these rotating walls to switch the edge between the attack team and the defence team,” explained Yuan. “So we encourage players to fight for that core area to maintain their edge or get the edge for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other maps have their own gimmicks – BlackMarket’s manually controlled bridge allows players to change the map’s layout and even pull the ground from under their opponents’ feet; Akhet has an underground river that allows sneaky players to move directly from the middle area to a bomb site; and Tundra has magic portals that instantly zap players between gates to outmanoeuvre the other team. It was fun to explore these maps, and clearly players who take the time to learn them properly will gain an advantage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dongtian is the home setting for the Lancer Kismet. Narrative Director Wenhe Fu explained, “The game has a multiverse concept, which allows us to have each character come from quite a different universe. We’ll take some time in future phases to introduce those background details to players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Built into a mountain and dotted with ancient wooden temple buildings, mystical statues and wizened trees with gracefully warped trunks, Dongtian’s Eastern aesthetic brings a smart visual twist to FragPunks’ colourful world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Art Director Yiming Li told us, “We wanted to blend ancient buildings that look like they could come from China with near-future science and technology elements, as well as some religious elements. While each map will have its own distinctive cultural features, we want them all to fit into the game’s overall sci-fi feeling. It’s like in Star Wars: Each of the civilisations are very different, but when they are viewed as a whole, they also exist under a harmonious sci-fi setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that brings us to FragPunk’s visuals. This is a really gorgeous game. The punk-influenced and sci-fi-tinged fluorescent aesthetic is rich and appealing, and its kill animations are punctuated by dazzling bursts of colour. Its maps are extremely readable, and player characters pop, making it easy to follow the action. Even its menus are pretty to look at, with the flashy presentation you’d expect from a Persona game or Street Fighter 6, with bold layouts accented by graffiti scribbles. It really stands out in the hero shooter space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk will be free to play, with a small selection of Lancers available at the start so that players can learn them gradually, unlocking more as they go through in-game currency accrued through play or paid microtransactions. Other optional purchases will be strictly cosmetic. We’ll have to wait until launch to see how the service side pans out – other NetEase games like Marvel Rivals and Naraka: Bladepoint have seen complaints about pricing, but that aside they have managed to keep players satisfied, so hopefully that’s a good sign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Shard Clash and Duel modes we tried, FragPunk will feature a mix of modes at or after launch that are targeted at both hardcore and casual players, including one where all players are forced to use the same Lancer, or melee weapons only, and so on. The development team is apparently largely made up of pro-level players, but it’s clear they have also taken steps to make the game accessible to newbies and even streamers and their viewers.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago, the last time Framework had an event in San Francisco, California, the highlight was the Framework Laptop 16 — a laptop promising the “holy grail” of upgradable graphics cards, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">easily one of the most ambitious laptops ever made</a>.</p><p>But today, the Framework Laptop 16 got little mention at its new event, which focused on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date">new, similarly gamer-oriented Framework Desktop</a> instead. While the Desktop and Framework’s original 13-inch laptop both got the latest AMD processors today, we don’t yet know if or when the Framework Laptop 16 might leap forward too.</p><p>The only mention of Framework’s flagship laptop was a new “One Key Module” that will experimentally be available for the Framework community to build their own electromechanical keyboards, should they choose to, that would be thin enough to fit in the Laptop 16’s extremely thin Input Module bay. (You can see how the Input Modules work <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7269794917466115374">in my video here</a>.)</p><div><p>While Framework did finally<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322955/framework-16-expansion-bay-dual-m2-adapter"> ship its promised M.2 adapter bay in December</a>, which will let you stick extra SSDs or other peripherals into a Framework Laptop 16 instead of a discrete graphics card, my big question is: is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">promising but somewhat problematic laptop</a> a dead end, or will it get new mainboards and new chips in the future?</p></div><p>I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel at the event today, and he wouldn’t say much, but he was clear on one thing: “We’re nowhere near done with Framework Laptop 16.”</p><p>I pushed my luck, asking: Is today the day he can assure us that the Laptop 16 will eventually see at least one GPU upgrade or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23612467/framework-laptop-16-battery-parts-games">snap-on secondary battery</a>?</p><p>“Today is not that day,” he told me.</p><p>I want to see Framework succeed, and perhaps it’s too early to begin to wonder otherwise — it was still shipping preordered batches of the Laptop 16 to buyers through the middle of last year.</p><div><p>But we’ve pushed the company pretty hard on the GPU in the past specifically because it’s a thing rivals have tried and failed at before — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement">Dell/Alienware even got sued over the failed promise of the Alienware Area-51m</a>, which never bothered to ship a second generation of its supposedly upgradable GPUs.</p></div><p>Framework has resisted our pushes so far, stopping short of confirming it in our 2023 story: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=upgradability%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Patel.%20%E2%80%9C-,We%20are%20committed,-to%20making%20sure">here’s his exact language at the time</a>. It’d be nice if Framework could assure buyers that the upgrades are absolutely coming. But personally, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">more than a few things</a> about that laptop I’d like to change, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Framework was doing a bit of a rethink even if it does deliver.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like its smaller (but far from <em>small</em>) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Blade 16</a> cousin, the new Razer Blade 18 will come with Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs and Intel Arrow Lake CPUs. But one major way it differs is its large 18-inch display, which has dual modes allowing it to run at either 3840 x 2400 at 240Hz or 1920 x 1200 at 440Hz.</p><p>The Blade 18 will start at $3,199.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti and climb to $4,499.99 with an RTX 5090. But if either the Blade 18 or the already announced $2,799.99 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">Blade 16</a> are the right pricey option for you, you’ll have to wait until late-April for them to actually ship.</p><p>Razer isn’t the only PC manufacturer offering new gaming laptops for preorder today. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610255/nvidia-rtx-50-series-gaming-laptop-preorders-begin-february-25th">Nvidia already teased</a>, a variety of new notebooks sporting RTX 50-series GPUs now have finalized pricing, and there are fresh offerings from the likes of <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/content/2025-rog-gaming-laptops/">Asus ROG</a>, <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/rtx50-gaming-laptops">MSI</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/gaming-pc/laptops.html" rel="sponsored">HP</a>. Back when many of these laptops were first announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340121/ces-2025-laptops-best-lenovo-asus-msi-razer-alienware">CES</a> in January, they mostly had estimated prices or no pricing at all.</p><p>Asus’s flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">ROG Strix Scar 16</a>, with its new wraparound RGB lighting, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-strix/rog-strix-scar-16-2025">starts at $3,299.99</a> with an RTX 5080 GPU and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog%2F90nr0l81-m005p0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">$4,299.99</a> with a top-of-the-line RTX 5090. The sleeker Zephyrus G14, which is a <em>Verge </em>favorite for balancing gaming performance with everyday usability, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/wtb/">starts at $2,499.99</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti. And the larger Zephyrus G16 starts with the same GPU at <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2025-gu605/wtb/">$2,699.99</a>. The G14 can go up to the RTX 5080, but the G16 will go all the way to an RTX 5090 once those higher-end configurations come a little later.</p><p>MSI has its RTX 5090-equipped <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/msi-Titan-18-HX-AI-A2XWJG-016US">Titan 18 HX AI</a> is up for preorder for an astounding $5,999.99. (That’s not even MSI’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">ridiculous Dragon Edition Norse Myth</a>, which is still listed as “coming soon.”) The company has some of its slightly more down-to-Earth gaming laptops up for preorder as well, like the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Stealth-18-HX-AI-A2XWHG-029US">Stealth 18 HX AI</a> with an RTX 5070 Ti starting at $2,999.99.</p><p>Lots of these gaming laptops are sitting at the high end with high prices, and some are more expensive than their last-gen versions with 40-series GPUs. Like, previous generations we may have to wait until cheaper mobile GPUs are announced and brought to market to get something not priced into the stratosphere. Hopefully the mobile versions of Nvidia’s new cards won’t be saddled some of the problems that have hit its latest desktop class, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">mediocre improvements over their last-gen counterparts</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609920/rtx-5090-melting-power-connector-current-distribution">power issues</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">manufacturing missteps</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first PCIe Gen 5 SSDs from the likes of Seagate and Crucial began hitting the market nearly two years ago, but Samsung has been notably absent with its own model. That will change in March with the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-announces-9100-pro-series-ssds-with-breakthrough-pcie-5-0-performance/">arrival of the Samsung 9100 Pro series</a>, its first consumer-ready pure PCIe Gen 5 SSD built with NVMe 2.0. At launch, it will be available in 1TB (starting at $199.99), 2TB ($299.99), and 4TB ($549.99) capacities in an M.2 form factor, with or without heatsinks. An 8TB configuration, a first for Samsung NVMe SSDs, is slated for the second half of 2025.</p><p>By the numbers, the 9100 Pro’s theoretical maximum random read and write speeds — 2,200K and 2,600K input-output operations per second (IOPS) — are at least twice as fast as the last-gen Samsung 980 Pro, a PCIe Gen4 SSD. Our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743546/pcie-gen-5-ssd-nvme-drive-speed-test-comparison-hands-on">earliest comparison of that SSD</a> with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0BX4HGFGV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Seagate’s Firecuda 540</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-T700-Gen5-NVMe-CT1000T700SSD3/dp/B0C3K1QBSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Crucial’s T700</a> showed no noticeable benefits for PC gaming; however, the difference may be more evident for heavier computing workflows. If nothing else, it’d be nice to know you’re future-proofed, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879732/pcie-6-0-final-specification-bandwidth-speeds">until PCIe Gen 6 arrives</a>.</p><p>The gains might be more apparent if you’re talking about large-volume file transfers, though, which videographers or software engineers working with large datasets might appreciate. Samsung says the 9100 Pro (built on its V Nand TLC V8 with a custom controller) can reach sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8GBps and 13.4GBps, respectively. That’s roughly double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price">last-gen 980 Pro</a>, and about 2-3GBps per second faster than the earliest PCIe 5 SSDs can manage.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I finished <em>Avowed </em>last night, and despite all the tense battles and carnage and explosive effects and beautiful colours on display during the game's closing hours, I've woken up today unable to stop thinking about...a bunch of choices I had to make in the middle of<a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> otherwise pedestrian dialogue sections</a>.</p><p>Obsidian (and <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>) fans in particular will already know where I'm going here, but a lot of people (myself included!) are new to all this, so indulge me: If you play <em>Avowed</em>, and you are approaching the endgame (or any decision that will seemingly have ramifications on what happens later), please have conviction.</p><p><em>Avowed </em>does not shy away from putting tough choices in front of you, but what separates them from many other RPGs is that they're choices that are tough for <em>you</em>. <em>Avowed</em> will show you a town and say, oh no, is this town in trouble? You could do this to try to help, which will kill a bunch of people. Or you could do <em>this</em>, which will kill a different bunch of people. Or <em>this</em>, which could kill nobody, or kill <em>everybody</em>. Who knows! How much do you care about one group over the other, and how will it sit with you if you condemn one to death instead of the other based on their vibes?&nbsp; There is no best decision here, because every decision you make is flawed.</p><figure><figcaption>I was trying to help!</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever you choose, people will die, it will suck, and someone in your party will hate you for it. I spent the last few hours of <em>Avowed </em>with folks openly furious at me, an entire race of people unable to even look me in the eye, and that's <em>after </em>I'd made a decision that saved their entire city. I thought I'd done the right thing! But nope, to them, I was a monster.</p><p>Turns out there's no clean fix for a dying island ravaged by plague and haunted by an imprisoned god. Everything here is terrible, everyone you meet imperfect and for some reason the fate of that terror is continually left up to you to decide in the middle of a conversation.</p><p>I'm not saying the choices here are inconsequential. They're very consequential! They decide the fate of gods, of continents, of cities, of empires! But when every decision you make has a huge impact in <em>some </em>way, the focus is less on you changing the world, which is being changed no matter what you say, and more on how you can live with the changes that you chose.</p><p>Basically, <em>Avowed </em>is not a game for reloaders. There's no way to revisit older decisions to make the "right" choice because there simply isn't one. There's no avoiding casualties; you just have to choose who dies and make peace with that. There are only choices that are right for <em>you</em>.</p><p>That's my favourite thing about <em>Avowed</em>, and also maybe my biggest piece of advice to anyone who is yet to play it: its most consequential narrative "rewards" aren't found in changing the ending or making sure a party member survives, but in presenting a world in chaos to the player as a Rorschach Test, one designed to see that if terrible decisions must be made, it's up to you to reflect on just why you made them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
If your Sims 4 nights have been lacking a certain criminal <em>frisson</em> for the last 11 years, things are about to get a whole lot more exciting. Over a decade after its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has finally added the series' iconic burglar as part of its latest free update.
</p>
<p>
The burglar was, of course, a perpetual looming menace across the first three Sims games, threatening to slip onto your lot in the dead of night - accompanied by a dramatic musical sting - in order to steal your valuables and scarper. Assuming the police didn't get there first.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for fans of late night thievery and stripy knitwear, burglars didn't make the cut when The Sims 4 launched in 2014. But now, more than a decade of nocturnal peace is set to be shattered as the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">celebrates its 25th anniversary</a>.
</p>

<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/burglar-dev-diary">detailed in EA's announcement</a>, The Sims 4's burglar - now named Robin Banks - behaves similarly to her earlier counterparts. She'll sneak into homes after dark when residents are asleep, shoving items into her sack before making her escape. Her stealing spree can potentially be stopped, however, if Sims call the police before she flees into the night.
</p>
<p>
The purchasable burglar alarm is back too, guaranteeing the police will arrive in time to make an arrest - and providing other safeguards if Sims are handy enough to install them. A suitably equipped alarm can, for instance, zap a passing burglar, causing her to drop her stolen goods. Additionally, bold (and ideally gym-fit) Sims can take Robin on in a one-on-one fight.

<p>
EA says it's added a total of 37 player-directed interactions and 50 unique reactions relating to the burglar across The Sims 4's base game and 17 different packs. Depending what expansions you own, dogs can chase burglars out of the house, werewolves can intimidate them into leaving, spellcasters can deter them with magic, and Servos can zap them into place. Scientists, meanwhile, can immobilise them with a Freeze Ray, and vampires might have a late night snack.
</p>
<p>
If all that sounds a bit much, EA notes burglar visits will be rare by default. However, those wanting to increase the frequency of break-ins can activate the Heist Havoc Lot Challenge, causing burglars to turn up more often and potentially making alarms go on the blink.
</p>
<p>
The burglar is available now as part of The Sims 4's latest free base game update. This paves the way for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-lets-you-run-your-own-pet-cafe-laundrette-or-tattoo-parlour">upcoming Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack</a> - letting players run everything from a pet cafe to a tattoo parlour - which launches next Thursday, 6th March.
</p>
<p>
All this comes as The Sims series celebrates its quarter-century anniversary with a range of events, including (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly</a>) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warner Bros. has confirmed reports that they are shutting down three of their game studios, closing Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego is what they’re describing as a “strategic change in direction”.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>, the publisher’s statement says, “We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.”</p>


<p>Of particular note is the closure of Monolith Productions, who was working on a Wonder Woman video game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">first announced in 2021</a>. This game was the subject of reporting earlier this month that stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/report-rocksteady-working-on-single-player-batman-as-wonder-woman-game-rebooted/">the game’s development had been rebooted</a> within the last year after creative leads left the studio.</p>
<p>Monolith’s last game was Middle-earth: Shadow of War, back in 2017, the studio having pioneered the patented Nemesis system with their first Middle-earth game three years earlier. However, the studio’s storied history goes back much further with landmark titles like FEAR, the niche and kitschy No One Lives Forever, and Aliens vs. Predator 2.</p>
<p>Player First Games was the studio behind online multiplayer brawler MultiVersus, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">burst onto the scene with its open beta in 2022</a>, but ultimately flopped at its 2024 relaunch, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">recently sunset by WB</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, WB Games San Diego was a studio founded in 2019 and had reportedly been working on an unannounced “AAA, free-to-play, cross-platform game.”</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been struggling for quite some time, it seems, and these three studios are seeing the wider consequences of those struggles. This feels like less of a “change in direction” and more about WB making a cold financial decision. Wonder Woman’s long-running development will have been very costly, and there was seemingly no end in sight, while Player First would have been right back at the start of the development cycle. “AAA, free-to-play” has also gone from seeming like a sure bet to company execs to a massive risk.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how many jobs are being lost as part of these studio closures, and Warner Bros. has not publicly explained what redundancy and support packages they will be offering to those affected.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go to those suddenly out of work, and hope that they can find new employment soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-clipping-software-for-creating-cs2-highlights.1118955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-clipping-software-for-creating-cs2-highlights/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You’ve just hit a beautiful clip in Counter-Strike 2. A 1v4 or a 1v5 in the final rounds of regulation to give your team the win. Your voice chat crackles to life with the sounds of your jubilant teammates. But then reality sets in: you don’t have any program to clip it with.</p>



<p>So many CS2 players have lost clips to the void because they don’t have any clipping software. With all the choices, it can feel overwhelming to pick one, but most provide the same basic features while offering some neat additional ones. Here are our recommendations for the best clipping software to capture your CS2 highlights.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-clipping-software">Best CS2 Clipping Software</h2>



<h3 id="h-medal">Medal</h3>



<p>Medal is a popular choice for clipping highlights from CS2 and other titles. There are several features that Medal utilizes that are attractive to players, including built-in editor tools and an activity feed where you can share and view other clips. Medal lets players hit a shortcut key to save footage from the past 15 seconds up all the way to the past 20 minutes, or the entirety of the gameplay session. You can also use the editing tools on video that wasn’t captured through Medal.</p>



<p>Medal offers a premium the enables cloud sync and larger uploads to the feed, but it’s also a free-to-use application.</p>



<h3 id="h-steelseries-gg">SteelSeries GG</h3>



<p>The SteelSeries GG application, which is used for managing your SteelSeries devices, also features a Moments section for clipping highlights of CS2 and other games. What sets it apart from other pieces of software is an auto-clip feature that automatically slips specific moments. For CS2 in particular, it will automatically detect and clip 3-kill rounds, headshot kills, and knife kills, but you can adjust it to only include one or two of these events. Additionally, after your game closes, a window pops up of all the clips generated, letting you quickly delete ones not worth keeping.</p>



<h3 id="h-steam-game-recording">Steam Game Recording</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Steam introduced Steam Game Recording back in June 2024, giving players the option to sign up for the program beta and clip highlights through Steam. Steam Game Recording offers two recording options: manual recording that starts and stops with a keyboard recording, or automatic “background recording” that saves your most recent two hours of gameplay. After recording, players can use the built-in clip editor to trim down recordings into clips.</p>



<p>Which software do you prefer for clipping CS2 highlights? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you want to unlock free daily cases and rewards in CS2,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

                <p>When it comes to life simulator games, EA's The Sims has largely had the field to itself since its launch 25 years ago. But Krafton's upcoming title, InZoi, looks like it could be a real contender in terms of scale, and it even has more realistic characters than The Sims' cartoonish avatars. Regardless, InZoi director Hyungjun Kim says that he has a great deal of respect for The Sims and doesn't view the two games as being in competition with one another.</p><p>"We see InZoi not as a competitor to The Sims, but rather as another option that fans of this genre can enjoy," said Kim during an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzoi-director-says-we-have-great-respect-for-the-legacy-the-sims-has-built-and-doesnt-see-their-game-as-a-director-competitor-our-aim-is-to-provide-a-different-experience" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "We have great respect for the legacy The Sims has built over the years, since we know that reaching that much depth in such a short period of time is no easy task. This is due to the nature of life sim games which cover the vast and complex concept of 'life,' making it difficult to capture its every aspect."</p><p>Kim went on to note some of the features of InZoi, which set it apart from The Sims. In addition to the realistic style for the characters and the world around them, he said that InZoi has "in-depth customization features, and AI-driven creative tools." Krafton has previously stated that the AI features can allow the avatars to develop personalities and even let players use a picture of furniture to translate an object into a 3D model that can be used in the game.</p><p>InZoi was originally supposed to enter early access in late 2024 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-competitor-inzoi-has-been-delayed-but-it-finally-has-an-official-release-date/1100-6527652/" data-ref-id="1100-6527652">it was pushed back</a> to PC on March 28, with a console release to follow at a later date. During Gamescom, GameSpot was able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-life-sim-inzoi-you-can-crash-cars-ride-rollercosters-and-commune-with-ghosts/1100-6526125/" data-ref-id="1100-6526125">play an in-progress build of InZoi</a> that allowed players to do a wide variety of things, including becoming ghosts after reaching an untimely end. Krafton also previewed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-gamescom-trailer-shows-the-joy-and-pain-of-everyday-life/1100-6525913/" data-ref-id="1100-6525913">the InZoi character studio tool</a> for a limited time on Steam.</p>

                <p>Bungie hasn't been shy about deleting older content from Destiny 2 (a process it calls "vaulting") in order to make room for new stuff, but it appears this controversial practice had some unintended consequences. As part of a lawsuit filed against them, Bungie had to cite fan videos from YouTube, because the content in question is no longer part of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, a sci-fi writer named Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a lawsuit against Bungie last year, alleging that an enemy faction called the Red Legion was plagiarized from the author's WordPress writing. In its response, Bungie dismissed the claims as baseless, but the company's counsel was forced to cite fan YouTube compilations of cutscenes and gameplay from the vaulted original campaign of Destiny 2 in order to make their case. While the publisher would normally be able to simply submit a copy of the game as an exhibit, that's not possible here for obvious reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because (1) Destiny 2's narrative is only available to players in the form of a live-service video game that has changed significantly over time, and (2) physical copies of Destiny 2, and any 2017 version of Destiny 2, are no longer available, the attached videos are the best possible way for the Court to review the accused work," reads the explanation given to the Court in part. In lieu of this, Bungie linked two videos, including a ten hour "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M">complete story of Destiny</a>" compilation from YouTuber My Name is Byf.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been some time since Bungie last vaulted content, although it has progressively reintroduced certain key content, including raids, that were rendered unplayable for an extended period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still no word on the outcome of the lawsuit.</p>

		<p>All children of the 90s love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – or Hero Turtles depending on which backwater country doesn’t allow children near the word ‘Ninjas’. The truth is they’re both heroes and ninjas, and they’re having a very 2020 revival right now, with a series of digital adventures showing that there’s plenty of hero left in those half-shells. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover is the newest game in the canon, but, as the title suggests, this is going to be a very different kind of adventure for Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover – I swear, that’s going to be TMNT: TT by the time we get to the end of this news story – takes our beloved turtles into uncharted territory, because unlike recent hits like beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">TMNT: Shredders Revenge</a>, or the rogue-like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>, Tactical Takeover is a turn-based strategy, owing more to games like X-COM or Fire Emblem than it does to Streets of Rage. It’s an interesting idea, and given that the team are one of the most beloved groups in the last thirty years it feels like it’ll pay off. I particularly appreciate the range of experiences that Turtles fans can enjoy right now, and rather than resting on the simple ‘smacking people about’ action that you’d expect, this offers a new cerebral take on the green group.</p>
<p>What’s even better, is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">you can try it out right now</a>, with a demo appearing as part of the Steam Next-Fest. It’s a real blast, and you can stay tuned for a full preview of it in the coming days. The Steam Next Fest demo features a tutorial and a modified version of the first chapter of the game, inviting players to experience the turtle action first-hand as they take on the Foot Clan.</p>


<p>It sounds as though they’re going through some stuff too, with both Splinter and Shredder dead, and the beloved gang starting to fall apart. Hopefully you can keep them together – though not if that’s strategically a bad idea, you need to watch out for area of effect attacks, of course.</p>
<p>The game’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, which is the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., best known for his work as a lead developer on I Am Your Beast, CLICKOLDING, El Paso, Elsewhere, and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. We’re certainly intrigued, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more ahead of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takeover’s launch on PC later this year.</p>

Shortly after, WB confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement</a>.</p><p>“We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises – <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, DC and <em>Game of Thrones</em>,” WB wrote. “After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's <em>Wonder Woman</em> videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. … As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.”</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon reports</a> that in an email to staff, Perrette, the CEO and president of global streaming and games for Warner Bros. Discovery, said that the company hopes to "repurpose our talent where possible," but as evidenced by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cypheroftyr.bsky.social/post/3lizlkbt2tc2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts from now-former employees</a>, that's far from an across-the-board directive. Perrette went on to talk about "swagger," because these people can never not be nauseatingly embarrassing while also revealing that they do not have souls.</p><p>“We need to and will do better for our fans first and foremost, and also because regaining that credibility is critical to us securing even more investment in Games in the years to come,” Perrette wrote in the email to staff. “Getting our swagger back happens one high quality game release at a time, and our financial credibility gets rebuilt one fiscal quarter at a time – delivering what we said we would deliver, and no big negative surprises.”</p><p>As Stephen Totilo, former boss of both Schreier and everybody at Aftermath, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lizl7ipdg22l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> to cap off this incredibly dour crossover episode, Warner Bros Discovery’s quarterly earnings update is in just two days. Odds are this ritual bloodletting is, as ever, about pleasing the shareholders. IP like <em>Harry Potter</em>, perhaps the least imaginative story ever told about literal wizards, and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, a franchise so tapped that I grow tired just thinking about it, will <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue until morale improves</a>. The studios involved will not, unless they produce infinite hits forever – unless they cause The Line to stand so erect that it tickles God’s own toesie-woesies.</p><p>I’m sure said shareholders will leap into the air and click their heels when they hear that people have lost their jobs, and a legacy that includes <em>Blood</em>, <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, <em>Condemned: Criminal Origins</em>, and <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> has been flushed down the toilet. I do not imagine many of them will linger long on the fact that WB <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-patent-for-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patented Monolith’s incredible Nemesis System</a> – which allowed enemies in the <em>Mordor </em>games to develop personal rivalries with the player and even taunt you with the specific ways they dispatched you – and then failed to meaningfully redeploy it, preventing other game developers from iterating on a mechanic that could have defined an era.</p><p>After all, that is not their job. Their job is to serve, and be served by, The Line. Our job is to slurp slop from the boot heel – to bury ourselves in meaningless nostalgia for boy wizards until we’ve forgotten that human beings are part of this process at all.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-decision-choices-story-im-so-sorry-everybody"><h3>Every Decision You Make In Avowed Is Terrible</h3></a><p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>It’s time to put all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">lessons I’ve learned about<em> Infinity Nikki</em>’s gacha system</a> to the test. There’s <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/122">a new event coming</a> to the game and with that comes a new outfit I actually want this time. </p></div><p>After the game taught me an unfortunate lesson on the gacha economy, I’ve kinda taken it easy with <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, and have found myself enjoying it way more at a slower pace.</p><p>Updates come about once a month, and when I first started playing, I’d blaze through all the new and shiny quests within days only to spin my wheels at the tail end of the month desperate for something new to do. With that in mind, I slowly worked my way through all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year content</a>, completing everything I wanted mere hours before the event was due to wrap up. It feels like I’ve finally gotten into a steady rhythm with the game. I know how to play and how to spend and I’m happy again enjoying the game for what it is.</p><p>With the flashy fireworks in the distance, I took a look ahead to the next event, Eerie Season, due to start February 26th. It’s an oddly themed update. Typically games save their spooky events for October not March. But the community has been clamoring for more darker themed clothing since the overwhelming majority of the game’s items are pink and pastel so this seems like a response to that. The update will also flesh out the Queen’s Palace Ruins, an area of the game that’s visually interesting with its dilapidated and haunted castle vibe but devoid of any story or quest content. I am interested in poking at the darker bits of <em>Infinity Nikki’</em>s story and the overall lore of the world and Eerie Season seems poised to give me just what I’m looking for.</p><p>One of the things that’s helped me stick to my guns about not spending any extra money is the fact that premium outfits have never really moved me at all. Everything’s cute, of course, but nothing’s made me sit up and go “I must have this!” However, that apathy disappeared the moment I took a look at the premium outfits for Eerie Season.</p><p>I saw that cowboy outfit and audibly cursed. I’m from the midwest, we don’t have cowboys here. I don’t even like cowboys like that but … <em>I must have this</em>. So I’ve decided to apply all the tricks and tips I’ve learned about gacha game to acquiring this one outfit without spending any extra money. I think I’ll be able to do it, too. </p><p>After that rather frustrating lesson on exactly how gacha games can fleece even the most clear-eyed players, I haven’t spent any more money and have ignored the game’s clothing slot machine. As a result, I’ve amassed a small but tidy sum of premium currency, although not enough to get the cowboy outfit outright. After some light mathing, I’ve determined that I’ll need another 4,000 or so of the premium currency (or roughly $15). Thankfully, with what the battle pass and the new event quests will provide, I’m reasonably confident that I’ll have more than enough to get the entire outfit without any extra spending.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I’m excited about it. Not just because I’ll have an outfit that I truly want but also because there’s a thrill to making, executing, and succeeding with a plan. We’ll see how that goes when the new event starts February 26th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire. One deeply frustrating wrinkle in this is that one of Monolith Productions’ greatest claims to fame has been patented by the same company that just shut down the studio.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195922,196345" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>2014’s <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>was one of the best surprises of that year. One of the most notable parts of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> spin-off was the Nemesis system, a clever mechanic that married gameplay and narrative in a way that few games have ever been able to pull off. In short, the Nemesis system tracks your encounters with different Uruk foes throughout the game, and enemies that you face in a fight can be promoted in Sauron’s army, gaining power and rank. What made it so fascinating was that it created micronarratives throughout the game. Instead of facing generic enemies until you hit the credits, you could be facing rivals that grew as you progressed throughout the game. All of this made the experience feel like an emergent, self-authored revenge story reactive to how you played. Monolith further iterated on it in the sequel <em>Shadow of War</em>. In a perfect world, this kind of mechanic would have been copied a dozen times over until teams integrated it into so many games we got tired of seeing it. However, Warner Bros. had other plans.</p><p>After the runaway success of <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, WB started mobilizing to patent the Nemesis system so no one else could use it in 2015 then proceeded to only make use of it one more time with <em>Shadow of War</em> despite plenty of opportunities to integrate it into series like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-shouldve-stolen-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system-1714797977"><em>Batman</em></a></span>.

However, given Warner Bros. has done nothing with it, the patenting of the Nemesis system was especially wasteful.

Now the studio that was responsible for what could have been a revolutionary system in narrative design has been shut down and the project that it spent years working on that would have used it won’t see the light of day.</p><p>While it’s hardly the most important thing that’s happened today, it’s a sad reminder that when corporations own your work, it could disappear with a snap of a finger, no matter how brilliant it is. My heart goes out to folks affected by these studio shutdowns, and it especially goes out to those whose creativity is being locked away in a vault that Warner Bros. may never open up again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, another Bloomberg report suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble">Wonder Woman was in trouble</a> after rebooting and switching directors in early 2024. This came amid larger struggles at the company's gaming division, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">layoffs at Rocksteady</a>, the lukewarm reception to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">shutdown of MultiVersus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even more recently, WB Games has appeared to undergo a restructuring of sorts, as long-time games head David Haddad <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">announced his departure from the company,</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2ea08a79-b569-4349-8ee8-993ba5599179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors circulated that the division might be sold off</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, this move represents a blow to WB's DC universe-connected gaming efforts. Notably, just yesterday, James Gunn and Peter Safran <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-couple-years-before-we-see-the-first-dcu-video-game-james-gunn-says-but-first-fortnite">said in a presentation</a> that it would be "a couple of years" before the first DCU video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this closure, the games industry loses three incredibly storied studios. Monolith Productions, which had been working on Wonder Woman, was founded in 1994 and acquired by WB in 2004. It's best-known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War, the former of which pioneered the lauded Nemesis system that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-patent-for-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB successfully patented in 2021</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games, a newer studio established in 2019, was responsible for MultiVersus. The game was well-received critically and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-debuted-as-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-last-month">saw launch success</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">underperformed relative to WB's expectations</a>. WB San Diego, similarly, is a newer studio established in 2019 with a focus on mobile, free-to-play games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These shutdowns continue a trend going back roughly three years of increasing games industry layoffs, project cancellations, and studio closures. In 2023 alone, it's <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated that over 10,000 game developers were laid off</a>. That number shot up to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 14,000 in 2024</a>, and while <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 has seen numerous closures</a>, the exact number of impacted individuals is hazier due to fewer companies reporting these layoffs and shutdowns, or specific numbers affected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>8BitDo has released an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">upgraded version of its Ultimate controller </a>now available to <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DR8Y5W6Z?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">preorder through Amazon</a> for $59.99 in purple, black, and white color options. The new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 features a similar asymmetrical stick layout to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">8BitDo’s original Ultimate controller that launched in 2022</a>, but adds additional buttons, interactive LED lighting, and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) joysticks that are even more durable than Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p>We still don’t know if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Nintendo will switch to Hall effect joysticks</a> for the Switch 2, but companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">GuliKit have already moved away from them</a> in favor of TMR. The technology has already long been used in hard drives to boost storage capacities. For controllers, it allows for joysticks that draw less power, which can improve battery life while nearly eliminating the risk of joystick drift that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">plagued the Nintendo Switch</a> and other modern controllers before magnetic Hall effect technology was adopted.</p><p>8BitDo is also bringing over the RGB Fire Ring lighting effects first introduced on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325092/8bitdo-ultimate-mini-wired-microsoft-xbox-controller-rgb-lighting">smaller-sized Ultimate C wired Xbox controller</a>. As the branding implies, both joysticks feature a ring of color-changing LEDs around their base with several lighting modes that react to button presses (including the triggers) or the direction the joysticks are being pushed.</p><p>The Ultimate 2’s triggers still use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and reliability, but 8BitDo has introduced a switch that lets you swap their behavior between longer draw triggers ideal for racing games and short pull tactile triggers for quicker responses while playing first-person shooters. And like the budget-minded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2c</a>, the Ultimate 2 has an extra pair of customizable shoulder buttons on the back.</p><p>The controller connects to 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2, which is also available as a mobile app, allowing buttons to be remapped and the sensitivity of joysticks and triggers to be adjusted. The controller has support for motion controls for games that support it, and a charging dock is still included.</p><p>Connectivity options include Bluetooth, a wired USB-C connection, or a low-lag 2.4GHz wireless connection using an included USB-C dongle. But like the cheaper Ultimate 2C, 8BitDo has only made its new Ultimate 2 controller compatible with PCs running Windows 10 and later or Android devices running Android 9.0 and newer.</p><p>Versions of the new Ultimate 2 compatible with the Xbox, iOS, or Nintendo Switch (and presumably the Switch 2) haven’t been announced yet, but 8BitDo previously released <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/">additional versions of the original Ultimate controller</a> with alternate compatibility.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
