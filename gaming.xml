            <p>
You know, I'm surprised that EA has never made a Sims reality show where contestants have to act out odd, Simish challenges on a Truman Show-esque production lot, given how much the games themselves feel like simulators for the trashiest (said lovingly) TV show genre. In the meantime, while it isn't at all themed reality shows, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4's</a> next expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy, seems like a perfect fit for a fictitious one of your own making.
</p>
<p>
A new gameplay trailer showed off how the packs dynasty system works, which is very much about family values. Starting your own dynasty begins with things like choosing your family crest, those aforementioned values, and the family members (or otherwise) you want included. There's also a prestige and unity meter, which can be affected in different ways, like, say, stabbing a mannequin, or getting a promotion because you're a nepo baby.
</p>

<p>
Your Sims also have personal ranks, and lowering the prestige and unity meter may also lower their rank, and another member could challenge your leadership. And then you can just start a new one, so who gives a hoot! There's even some conspiracy nonsense, affairs, scandals to take advantage of, can you see why I think this is ripe for a reality TV show scenario? That'll be up to you to figure out though.
</p><p>
Alongside all of that, there's three new neighborhoods to shape to your will, each of which is already ruled by a pre-established dynasty. Sims can now perform powershifts, which "add fantasy, storybook twists to your royal tale," according to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">blog post</a> about the expansion pack, where they might pull the sword in the stone, or flirt with a fancy frog. Said blog post goes into a lot more detail about what you can expect, so head there for more.
</p>
<p>
You've not got long to wait for the new expansion pack, as it's currently slated for release on February 12th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>

<p>I know, the 'precog' machine in that particular movie wasn't really a 3D printer, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2n7SXUM9m0">Tom's wee red balls</a> seemed to be made of some sort of weird wood rather than filament, but it was the same sort of magic inside my simple mind, and the first time I'd considered a machine that could create a fully 3D object in this way. So the two are forever connected, I'm afraid.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kzlowt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now that I am the owner of a 3D printer, now that we live in the actual future, and not that far off from where Tom Cruise and his wee red balls (and that really angry dude with the blonde hair) exist, I have to say, it feels rather mind-blowing to be able to create so many <em>things</em> so very readily.</p>
<p>I'm excited, is what I'm trying to say, and as a very excited gamer, you can bet your bottom Rupee that the first thing I've done with my precious new printer is dive headlong into a whole new world of knocking out my own accessories and smart little bits and bobs for my beloved Nintendo consoles. Oh yes, my sweet babies, daddy is going to take care of you now, you better believe it.</p>

<p>Sorry. Yes. I've been busy pumping rolls of filament into a big noisy machine that's currently located in my sitting room (*cries in wife*), browsing all of the sites and taking all of the notes on the best unofficial docks, grips, cartridge holders (and lots more) that are currently out there for 3D-printing fiends.</p>
<p>So, without any more nonsense, let's get on with taking a look at some of the best I've found and printed thus far, shall we?</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="a-quick-lesson-in-3d-printing-jargon">A quick lesson in 3D printing jargon</h2>
<p>To be as helpful as possible to anyone who might be browsing for something to 3D-print, I'll be dropping the time it takes to print off each of the objects I've made, as well as how much filament I've used to create each one. So, let's talk about a few simple things first.</p>
<p>There are different types of 3D printer out there. You could go with a resin one, which I have heard does <em>slightly</em> better fine details on models, or, like me, roll with a filament machine. This was an easy choice in my case as I have a busy house and some companies, such as Bambu Labs (other brands are available, but it's <a href="https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOor04U7NzjPojHuBAs55yckzd5ur_qvEiSJKtOYVuLfRRA9SpSYS&amp;id=578772891943051270">Bambu Labs' P1S with AMS</a> that I'm using here) have got a sort of Apple design aspect going on that makes it so you can have a printer in your house and it almost looks nice, and without any unreasonably bad mess or fuss. Well, it's a bit noisy sometimes, but not so much that it keeps me awake on a night print.</p>
<figure data-uuid="68c258caaa1d0"><a title="3D Printing Guide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68c258caaa1d0/3d-printing-guide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Filament is bought in rolls of colour ranging from bog-standard to fancy with reflective textures, wood effect, glow in the dark, holographic - basically anything you can think of. There are also different types, grades and levels of filament for different jobs. Oh, and you can change out your printing plate for different textured finishes on your plastic creations, too. So maybe you'll want a brick-grid one for Mario walls, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>For the models below, I'm keeping everything as cheap as possible, using basic PLA filament from a generic brand, but you could also grab PLA+ and onwards and upwards into tough and hard-wearing varieties, or go in other directions for the appropriate material to build, for example, a light and flexible insole for your shoe.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-find-the-designs-to-print">Where to find the designs to print</h2>
<p>All of the designs I've used can be found at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en">Makerworld.com</a>, or you can also grab them off the Bambu Handy app, if you've already got that installed on a device, and I'll drop links to the creations as we go through them as well!</p>

<h2 id="all-the-best-stuff-ive-3d-printed-so-far">All the best stuff I've 3D-printed so far</h2>
<h3 id="mario-warp-pipe-controller-stand-with-storage-for-7-game-carts">Mario Warp Pipe Controller Stand (with storage for 7 game carts)</h3>

<p>This was my first Switch-related print, and it's a belter!</p>
<p>A nice, easy first print to get started, with no complications such as adding supports or any of that nonsense. This controller holder includes the warp pipe itself along with a smart little insert which can manage a grand total of seven of your precious Switch carts.</p>
<p>I had no green filament left when I printed this off, so I've gone with an orange one, but I will be painting it gold very shortly with some acrylic paint! Yessir. SPECIAL PIPE.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> 1 hour 48 minutes<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 64g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1502329-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-stand-warp-pipe#profileId-1571705">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Stand Warp by @Dave_D_W -</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Snap Lock Grip</h3>

<p>I actually wanted one of these, and so instead of stumping up a wad of cash-cash-money, I've quickly knocked out this very impressive alternative.</p>
<p>There's not much that can go wrong with this sort of design, except perhaps the smaller attachments that keep the Joy-Con in place, but there were zero issues and it's a great fit. In terms of toughness and look/feel, it's also just as good as anything I'd likely find in a store.</p>
<p>To use, you hook on the left and right locking grip, by attaching to the top and bottom of your Joy-Con, then insert the controller into the main body of the grip to push the lock in there permanently. You can now easily click your Joy-Con in and out. Also, it's really light grip, so bonus points for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Print:</strong> Main Body takes 1.2 hours, whilst the left and right locking grips are 10 minutes each<br>
<strong>Filament Cost:</strong> 25g for the main body, and 10g per grip lock, for a total of 45g<br>
<strong>Creator/Creation Link:</strong> <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1514088-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-snap-lock-grip?from=search#profileId-1586658">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con Snap Lock Grip By Manabun Lab</a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-game-display-storage-10-slot-version">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game Display Storage - 10 Slot Version</h3>

<p>This very useful display storage is well worth printing out for any serious (and very professional) Switch gamer, such as myself, as not only can it hold lots of lovely game cases and some carts at the front (with gaps so you can see their stickers!), it can also be added to a clever wall-mounted system - for which you print off a few extra parts.</p>
<p>Also, the size can be adjusted from a 4-case holder all the way up to a big 18 model. So there's lots of choice here, and you can add to the storage over time. I've gone with the 10 slot version for this print, and I'll be honest, I should have gone with the 4 because I'm a <em>very</em> futuristic man who is almost 100% digital on the Switch game front these days. Physical media is Dickensian in my eyes. That's right, take your 'cartridges' out of my sight.</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-zelda-royal-crest-dock-cover">Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda 'Royal Crest' Dock Cover</h3>

<p>Why waste time printing off an entire dock when you can just make a faceplate to hide the unrelenting grim blackness (looks dark grey to me, to be honest) of Nintendo's vanilla offering? This is my biggest print thus far, clocking in at 6.5 hours and costing 204g of tasty filament, but the result, especially if you choose a snazzy filament or paint the result, is well worth it!</p>
<p>There are tons of cool Nintendo-themed plates and docks to choose from out there, and you could go crazy with fancy filaments such as gun metal and realistically shiny gold to really make this Zelda one pop off. Also, the design I've printed off here, which I've linked to below, has a whole bunch of other covers to choose from once you click into its printing screen.</p>
<p>As you can see, I've been a right bore and gone with the classic option, but you can be damn sure I'll be firing up 'Auld Betsy' later to print myself off a Yiga Clan one.</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-1-andamp-2-mini-game-cases">Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2 Mini Game Cases</h3>

<p>What's better than having a whole bunch of Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves? I'll tell you what, having a whole bunch of <em>mini</em> Switch or Switch 2 game cases on your shelves. Mate, that's what.</p>
<p>These may, at first glance, seem as though they are meant to be more for fun than anything else. However, they do also provide some much-needed protection. In fact, they are actually a great space-saving idea if you usually cart your cases around when going mobile.</p>
<p>One thing with these: the basic PLA I used seemed a little brittle at first, but the edges do soften up when you bend them, then you're free to add any covers you want to print off and add.</p>
<p>As you can see, I ran out of time on decorating this one, but jump to the link below to see how amazing a printed cover makes them look. Oh, and that all-important click as you snap the cat into place is reassuringly present.</p>

<h3 id="switchrest-car-headrest-mount-for-switch-2">SwitchRest Car Headrest Mount For Switch 2</h3>

<p>When I'm out and about and being driven around by either my wife or children, I like to recline fully in the back seat and make full use of my time by playing my beloved video games whilst yodelling loudly. No talking when daddy is playing his games and yodelling, please. Not unless you're offering me a snack. Thanks.</p>
<p>So, given my life preferences, it seems obvious that I might want an in-car Switch console holder. Of course I do. And this one is nice and quick and very straightforward to print, too!</p>
<p>There are lots of designs for car holders out there, and some of them get very fancy with retro NES looks and so on. However, the way this one hooks on is, perhaps, one of the better designs. It's very solid and secure as it hooks onto the fully extended kickstand, holding the console firmly in place. Oh, and it just happens to take way less time and materials than most of the rest.</p>
<p>Now I can combat boredom as my wife drives me to the local sweet shop by indulging in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/race_with_ryan_road_trip_deluxe_edition">Race With Ryan</a> in the car. Hey, it feels like I'm really driving!</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-multi-game-case-mario-mushroom-edition">Nintendo Switch Multi-Game Case (Mario Mushroom Edition)</h3>

<p>These delightful little containers hold four game carts and are absolutely fantastic quality when you see them finished off. The twisting mechanism on the top here actually surprised me with how robust and smooth it is. These will 100% properly protect and take care of your carts.</p>
<p>What's more, as with anything else you 3D print, you can change the size, so you could have a giant version, a 50% scaled-up version or whatever you fancy. There is also, of course, the opportunity to go wild with colours, matching all in-game types and maybe doing some weird trippy ones while you're at it. Hey, they are mushrooms, amirite? Hello? Mario?</p>

<h3 id="articulated-ancient-guardian">Articulated Ancient Guardian</h3>

<p>Okay, so I cracked and decided to do some less useful items, one of which is an articulated Guardian that, I'm not gonna lie, I might actually be fully in love with.</p>
<p>Articulated figures such as this, I want to point out, are one of the best things to print for instant fun I've found, as some of them really go to town with giving you loads of posing options.</p>
<p>So whether it's this big guy (which you could scale up to make even larger) or any of the many other characters out there, get stuck into articulated stuff. Put the word 'articulated' into every search. Change your name to Articulated. It's your life!</p>

<h3 id="kirby-mouse-mode-joy-con-2-adapter">Kirby Mouse Mode Joy-Con 2 Adapter</h3>

<p>Oh Kirby, you quietly violent little blob. How I adore your ways. So much so, in fact, that I just had to choose a Kirby design for my first Mouse Mode controller adapter. I mean, just look at him!</p>
<p>I didn't, as it turns out, have any pink filament to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_classics_kirbys_adventure">classic Kirby</a> colours here, but all that means is I got to experiment with something a little different instead. Remember with this print, if you choose to go with it, that you'll need a total of 6 hours and 20 minutes for both left and right adapters, so you might need to plan a little in advance, and this one uses lots of colours by default</p>
<p>So, if you want the classic Kirby look for a primo finish, make sure to stock up on pink, blue, black, white, and red PLA.</p>

<p>I couldn't finish up without adding this chap, could I? Oh, and in searching for this model, I discovered you can put pretty much <em>any character you can think of</em> into a search and something will turn up to print off!</p>

            <guid>1421821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> just held its 2026 summit this week, and with it came a bevy of details about future updates and plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. Oh what joy for you scaper or runes! The main thing that got a look-in was the game's next big update, Dowdun Reach: Madness of Zamorak, which certainly has an air of someone looking at any section of a given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> and thinking "yeah, I want a fortress like that."
</p>
<p>
This update comes following some feedback the devs received over a desire to see more locales with interiors and buildings to fight through and explore, hence the castle keepy nature of this update. There's a bunch of big scary knights to fend off, and in March more details will be shared regarding the kind of loot you'll be able to pick up ahead of its release at the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
What's perhaps a touch funny about this update is that the level cap for all skills will be raised to 99, "even though the skills aren't finished yet." Perhaps an odd choice, but one that's again based on some feedback of folks "wanting to grind out levels and not waste XP." So, if you're someone that likes the grind, technically for now you'll be wasting your time, but any level-locked bits will be automatically available to you as they get added in.
</p>
<p>
After this big update, the next big one is Umbral Sands: Fire of Fuzan, planned for release this summer, which brings you to a deserty area where during the day the sun will be your biggest enemy, requiring you to find shade or build shelter to avoid its rays. There's also a big ole dragon called Fuzan you have to be cautious of, because, well, this game is called Dragonwilds after all.
</p><p>
And lastly, there's Scorned Wilderness: Rage of Kuldra, which is currently planned for launch this autumn. Details are slim on this one, but a <a href="https://dragonwilds.runescape.com/">blog post</a> does have this to say: "What we can tell you is this: Kuldra must die. Face off against the God-Eater and bring down their tyrannical reign as you muster your allies, drive into the wilderness to acquire Rune Armour and delve into the heart of the Anima storm." Why does it always have to be the God-Eater? Can't it be something nicer, less fire-breathy for once?

            <p>
I'm sure there's been many a Dweet and forum post about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is already a dead game or some such silly thing to say about a game that's not even a week old, but it does at least seem like developer Wildlight is paying attention to some of the more constructive bits of criticism about the game. Namely, that many aren't fond of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> 3v3 Raids simply because it feels like there aren't enough people for such large maps. So in turn, there's already an update adding in an experimental new raid mode.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply, as opposed to 3v3 the headcount is upped to 5v5. "We heard the feedback!" reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/538877446766724427">Steam blog post</a>. "For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!" A couple of tweaks have also been made to account for the added numbers, the first being that raids are now 10 lives instead of six, and respawns take a bit longer during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused."
</p>
<p>
With this update also comes a new base called the Soul Well, a "dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak." You should notice some small improvements here and there, for things like animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and "other gameplay systems." On top of all that, you can also turn motion blur on or off now.
</p>
<p>
None of this sounds particularly massive on the offset, but for a game like 5v5 does sound like it should liven things up a bit. We'll just have to wait and see what the results are after this weekend!

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Wildlight has deployed another update to its live-service hero shooter, Highguard, introducing a 5v5 limited-time mode that will only be available this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of the most recent update you'll also find a brand new base, Soul Well, wherein "Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age" in both the 3v3 and 5v5 rotations. You can find out more in the teaser below:</p>

<p>To accommodate the bigger fireteams, lobbies have been updated to permit parties of five, and raids are now 10 lives instead of six. You should also expect slightly longer respawns during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused", and the Firing Range cannot support 5v5 at this time, so expect the option to be greyed out if your party has more than three players.</p>
<p>"As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team's dedication to creating a 'ready for live service' game, resulting in immediate action," the team said.</p>
<p>"Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard the feedback!</p>
<p>For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p>
<p>The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p>
<p>A few small tweaks for this mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li>
<li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</p>
<p>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</p>
<h2>New Base - Soul Well</h2>
<p>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</p>
<p>This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Quality of Life</h2>
<p>Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li>
<li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one." Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">Wildlight released an update</a>.</p>

<h2>The Roster</h2><p>WWE 2K26 boasts over 400 superstars, both current and legends, at launch, the biggest day one roster to date. While we only know of a small handful of names currently, the roster includes a host of new talent. Here are the confirmed superstars so far:</p><ul><li><strong>Andre the Giant</strong></li><li><strong>Bret Hart</strong></li><li><strong>Blake Monroe</strong></li><li><strong>Bron Breakker</strong></li><li><strong>Charlotte Flair</strong></li><li><strong>CM Punk</strong></li><li><strong>Cody Rhodes</strong></li><li><strong>Drew McIntyre</strong></li><li><strong>Eddie Guerrero</strong></li><li><strong>Iyo Sky</strong></li><li><strong>Izzi Dame</strong></li><li><strong>John Cena</strong></li><li><strong>Kane</strong></li><li><strong>Liv Morgan</strong></li><li><strong>Logan Paul</strong></li><li><strong>Myles Borne</strong></li><li><strong>Naomi</strong></li><li><strong>Penta</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Orton</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Savage</strong></li><li><strong>Rey Fénix</strong></li><li><strong>Rhea Ripley</strong></li><li><strong>Roddy Piper</strong></li><li><strong>Roman Reigns</strong></li><li><strong>Rusev</strong></li><li><strong>Seth Rollins</strong></li><li><strong>Stephanie Vaquer</strong></li><li><strong>The Undertaker</strong></li></ul><p>Additionally, former TNA World Champion and recent WWE signee <strong>Joe Hendry</strong> will be included as a pre-order bonus.</p><p>When asked if Lucha Libre AAA, which WWE acquired in 2025, would have any representation in WWE 2K26, Visual Concepts coyley replied, “Maybe. Stay tuned.” It’s worth noting that the game’s website features a teaser of a desk laden with WWE easter eggs and one suspiciously prominent photo of an iguana, potentially a nod to AAA star Mr. Iguana.</p>

<h2>New Match Types And Gameplay Updates</h2><p>WWE 2K26 will introduce four new match types: Inferno, I Quit, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster. Like 2K25, every match can be contested under intergender rules, so male and female wrestlers can compete against each other. The commentary teams now include Wade Barrett and Booker T as well.</p><p>Before the match starts, you can spice up and have more agency during introductions thanks to more interactive entrances. As superstars make their way to the ring, you can now toggle one of three pre-set special animations and interactions based on superstar face/heel alignment (such as offering/rejecting pre-match handshakes). You can similarly trigger pyro on the stage or in the ring. Players can also now choose to start matches in different ways, such as hyping the crowd before initiating contact or rushing an opponent before the bell rings.</p><p>As for gameplay updates, thumbtacks and shopping carts can now be used as weapons. Tables can also be stacked on top of each other in another much-requested addition. Visual Concepts touts improved reactability to falling/getting slammed on weapons, where superstars behave more realistically and take more damage from weapon offense.</p><p>They also tout smaller touches, such as how thumbtacks will visually stick to the bodies of characters to display damage. 2K26 also features improved and expanded crowd and barricade combat features. Other presentational touches include the addition of championship belt podiums at ringside during title matches.</p><p>The reversal and stamina systems have been revamped, and physics interactions have been upgraded. Visual Concepts compared 2K26’s physics as being akin to Smackdown vs. Raw 2011, for reference.</p>

<h2>Ringside Pass</h2><p>Visual Concepts is ditching its usual DLC pack model to introduce its version of a traditional battle pass. Called the Ringside Pass, it consists of 60 free tiers and 40 premium (paid) tiers where players can earn XP to unlock new content simply by playing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The team describes this as an "added value upgrade to DLC" in that players will pay the same amount of money they normally would for the old DLC packs, but the Ringside Pass rewards more content. Players earn XP across all game modes, and players who reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season can unlock Superstars, cosmetics, customization items, VC, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Visual Concepts also confirms that unlockable DLC superstars are available in the first section of the Ringside Pass, so it seemingly won’t take as long to gain new faces. The studio points out that Superstars and Legends that used to be part of the Supercharger, which is no longer a thing in 2K26, will instead be obtainable in the Season 1 Ringside Pass' free tier.&nbsp;</p><p>Six Seasons of Ringside Pass will be released throughout the year, with the Season 1 pass launching alongside the game.</p><h2>Showcase Mode</h2><p>2K26’s Showcase Mode will center on the career of cover star CM Punk. Narrated by the champ himself, this interactive documentary lets players relive Punk’s biggest matches and moments as well as engage in “What If?” style fantasy matches. For example, Visual Concepts says Showcase will explore the feuds and matches that could have happened if Punk hadn’t left WWE for nearly a decade in 2014.</p>

<h2>The Island</h2><p>The Island, the explorable quest-filled hub that debuted in 2K25, makes its return in improved form. This mode is available on all platforms this year (including PC, where it was absent last year). The mode’s story builds upon last year’s iteration, with a player choosing one of three factions battling to fill the power vacuum left after Roman Reigns’ fall as the tribal chief.</p><p>The Island’s progression system has been reworked, and it features a new environment: Scrapyard Brawl. It also features more immersive quests with cutscenes and dialogue screens. The Island boasts new Towers, shops, and branded gear for players to purchase using in-game and paid currency.</p><h2>My Rise</h2><p>The story-driven campaign is back with two new division-based storylines, and Visual Concepts says the babyface/heels decisions have a larger impact this time. My Rise is also more replayable, as players can continue engaging with the mode after wrapping up the main story to earn additional unlockables and achievements.</p><h2>My GM</h2><p>The popular general manager simulation mode features more match types, more possible matches, and more outcomes. Players can book intergender matches as well as bouts pitting 5, 6, and 8 superstars against each other. My GM now has more shows per season, the option to play a 50-week season, more cross-brand PLEs, and new management challenges to test would-be showrunners.</p><h2>My Faction</h2><p>WWE 2K’s collectible card game has new intergender lineups and the ability to “Quick Swap” cards during battles for more instantaneous and strategic play. &nbsp;New My Faction chemistry allows players to boost card performance and run-in support. Of course, you can now collect new card designs and enjoy a regular release of new themed card packs and seasonal content throughout the year.</p>

            <p>Developer AdHoc Studio has issued a statement insisting it was not "trying to hide" a disclaimer about censored content on Switch, but did admit it had inadvertently put the notice in "the absolute worst spot" on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship would be implemented as standard</a>. As we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">reported at the time</a>, this meant black boxes would conceal explcit graphics, and sex noises would be toned down.</p>
<p>AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release". Nintendo's own statement said: "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>

<p>Now, acknowledging it has been "quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo", the studio has issued a statement.</p><p>"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'. This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms," AdHoc wrote.</p>
<p>"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved."</p>
<p>The statement adds that AdHoc "absolutely need[s] to take full ownership" of the placement of that disclaimer, and while it "didn't have complete control of the language" the disclaimer contained, it did have control of its placement.</p>
<p>"It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</p><p>The team takes ownership of this, writing: "This is 100 percent our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AdHoc says it is "already working with Nintendo on a path forward", and while "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p>
<p>"To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we're truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed," the statement concluded. "Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon."</p>
<p>Dispatch is already hugely successful, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a>, possibly with even more sex scenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>.</p>

But there's <em>plenty</em> to come over the next 11 months, including many likely surprises for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>Amidst big anniversaries for <strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Metroid</strong>, we already have a pretty solid suite of games coming out over the next few months for the Switch 2, from the Big N itself to third-parties like Capcom and Square Enix, who have gone all-in on the hybrid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> may have kicked things off all nice and familiar, a there are a lot of unknowns still, but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> serving up an ace soon, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious</a> Book keeping us cosy with the kids, things are looking bright — and a little bit different. A brand new <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>, a <strong>Splatoon</strong> spin-off, a new <strong>Resident Evil</strong> day-and-date, and a long-awaited indie Zelda-like from the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a>. All that and more should make the Switch 2 the place to play games in 2026.</p>
<p>So, there's a lot go get excited about — but what are <em>you</em> most looking forward to in 2026, dear reader? Yes, we want you to tell us about the games you're excited to play on Switch 2 for the rest of the year. Only confirmed games, of course; no speculation allowed here! (well, <em>maybe</em> a little).</p>
<p>So we've listed out a handful of big Nintendo Switch 2 titles coming out this year in the poll below, but you can also add your own suggestions using the search bar at the top. If you're looking for some suggestions, then you can use our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/35-upcoming-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2026">most-anticipated games for the year</a> or our library of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?sort=date&amp;status=soon&amp;system=nintendo-switch-2">all the upcoming Switch 2 games</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:181925 @ 1769885621 -->
<p>Oh, and for this poll, we're looking for Switch 2 titles only, for now at least. We're sure you're all as jazzed as us (read: this writer) to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, but that's a Switch 1 game.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/867020/cassette-boy-review-pc-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>1421710</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s no secret that <em>Cassette Boy</em> is inspired by the classics. It’s a top-down adventure game in the vein of a retro <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, while your home base is a small town like in an older <em>Pokémon</em> game, complete with a mom who is constantly wishing you well. The game’s blocky 3D graphics evoke <em>Minecraft</em>, and you save at campfires that reset the world, like a FromSoft game. Everything in <em>Cassette Boy</em> even has a green tint that reminds me of playing games on my original Game Boy. But despite all of the clear influences, it still feels unique: underneath that charming exterior, <em>Cassette Boy</em> is a game filled with clever puzzles that forced me to use my head in ways I haven’t before.</p><p>The game’s main mechanic revolves around an idea <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2334330%2FCASSETTE_BOY%2F" rel="sponsored">“inspired by”</a> quantum mechanics: if you can’t see something in the game, it ceases to “exist” and remains in an essentially frozen state from the moment it went off-screen. If you push a block behind a wall, it’s not “there” anymore, and you can walk behind that wall without being impeded by the box. If an enemy goes fully behind a wall, it becomes invisible, will stop moving, and can’t damage you. Since it doesn’t exist, you also can’t damage it. The game also lets you rotate the camera to eight different points; imagine it’s on a compass, and with a tap of a shoulder button, you can rotate it to the north “point,” then northwest, then east, etc. So, with that hidden enemy, if you turn the camera so that it’s not behind the wall, it “reappears” and becomes a physical being again.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>If you tap a shoulder button…</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Pocketpair Publishing</cite></span></p></section><p><em>Cassette</em> Boy then sets up a bunch of puzzles that force you to mess with perspective to overcome obstacles. Early on, you’ll come across a button that makes a platform appear on a river when the button is pressed down, and the button is next to a boulder. Everyone who has played a <em>Zelda</em> game knows that the usual solution would be to move the boulder to keep the button down. But you can’t pick up the boulder in <em>Cassette Boy</em>; instead, the solution is to step on the button and then turn the camera so that the boulder entirely hides the pressed-down button. That way, the button becomes frozen while pressed down, allowing you to hop on the platform to get to the other side of the river.</p><p>In addition to moving the camera, you get tools like a bow and arrow to hit switches and enemies from a distance and cassette tapes that give you powers to see bombable walls or shrink you down. When it all comes together, <em>Cassette Boy</em> is really satisfying: when I was in the zone, I couldn’t wait to pick apart every new room to work through puzzles and search for hidden treasures tucked away out of sight. There are also clever battles against giant, blocky bosses, all to earn moon fragments (the main MacGuffin you’re tasked to find).</p><p>Sometimes, though, <em>Cassette Boy</em> can be obtuse. There are no maps to refer to. You often have to talk to the exact right person at the exact right time to move the main quest forward, and you don’t have much of an indication of who that might be except for a speech bubble over their heads. After you collect a moon fragment, the game will send you back to the main town but won’t tell you where to go, so I often got frustrated having to seek out all of the townspeople over and over again. Some of the puzzles also totally stumped me, and I usually had a full-game walkthrough open during my nearly eight-hour playthrough so that I could get hints on how to progress next.</p><p>But I also think all that obtuseness is by design, and it harkens back to the game’s inspirations. With older <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Pokémon</em> games, I have fond memories of wandering around, getting lost, and eventually finding my way back on course with a sigh of relief. With all the time I spent struggling, I was forced to learn my way around those worlds, and now I can recall how to get through the toughest parts of those games even though I haven’t played them for years. (Even the developers of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> think that getting lost can be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/11/14881076/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-interview">“very positive thing.”</a>)</p><p><em>Cassette Boy</em> evokes that old-school spirit. Even when it frustrated me, I usually didn’t mind the struggle, and it helped me learn my way around. Usually, I realized that finding the right way forward just required a new perspective.</p><p><sup>Cassette Boy<em> is now available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/867020/cassette-boy-review-pc-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 3S Now the Cheapest VR Headset Option After Sudden Price Drop, While PlayStation VR2 Remains at Full Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-now-the-cheapest-vr-headset-option-after-sudden-price-drop-while-playstation-vr2-remains-at-full-price-2000664623</link>
            <guid>1421707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3S stands out as one of the easiest ways to get started with virtual reality gaming right now. It’s budget friendly, doesn’t require a gaming PC, and has a growing library of polished experiences. With current discounts knocking around 10% to 15% off the retail price, the timing feels right for anyone curious about stepping into VR for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6979/">At the moment, the 128GB Meta Quest 3S is selling for $270, down from its usual $300 price tag.</a> The 256GB version has dropped from $400 to $350 and even comes bundled with <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> at no extra cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6979/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Access to Tons of Games</h2>
<p>In <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>for the Meta Quest 3S, you’re placed directly in the role of Batman as he hunts down a new villain called the Rat King across Gotham City on the Fourth of July. Acting as a narrative sequel to <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em>, it leans heavily into the strengths of virtual reality. Combat, investigation, and traversal feel more personal when your own movements drive the action. Using the Quest 3S headset and wireless motion controllers, the experience captures the fantasy of being the Dark Knight in a way traditional consoles simply cannot match.</p>



<p>Having a Meta Quest 3S opens the door to a broad catalog right out of the box. New owners receive three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription that includes access to more than 40 VR titles. One of the highlights is <em>Walkabout Mini Golf</em>, a deceptively rich game that shines through clever course design and relaxed multiplayer fun. Playing a round with friends scattered across different states feels surprisingly close to a real-world hangout. Played a lot of this over lockdown and there are moments, you’re not just hanging around with your buddies for real. Not saying it ever convinces you you’re really on a minigolf course, but it does hit ya with the same dopamine that hanging around in person with your buds does.</p>
<p>Another notable release is last year’s <em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This action-heavy title drops players into chaotic firefights filled with irreverent humor, backed by voice work from Neil Patrick Harris. While it is not included with Meta Quest+, it remains one of the biggest VR launches of 2025 and a strong showcase for what the hardware can handle.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the Quest 3S represents a meaningful step up from the Quest 2. The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset delivers smoother performance, while full-color passthrough and an easy-access action button make switching between virtual and mixed reality seamless. With discounts reaching up to $50 off retail pricing, the Meta Quest 3S feels like one of the most well-rounded VR deals available today.</p>

<p>Respawn didn't provide a specific reason as to why updates would be discontinued on Switch - although we can guess that it's something to do with the hardware given support continues on Switch 2 - but did say the discontinuation was part of the studio's goal to "continue to evolve Apex Legends' content and technical foundation" and "deliver a high quality experience".</p><p>"All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts," the team explained. "Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026.

            <guid>1421677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A thriving fan art community is always a sign of an entrenched playerbase. </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>, Valve’s secretive MOBA hero shooter, is currently teeming with creations all over social media that span the big three categories: horny, cute, and funny. In a way, these are perfect descriptors for the overall vibe of the latest six heroes to join the roster, which, alongside a plethora of additions and visual tweaks introduced in last week’s big update, have led to a newfound momentum worth paying attention to.</span></p> <p><span>The game’s lineup includes the sword-wielding demon Apollo, the unicorn-horned performer Celeste, arms expert priest Venator, a sleepy small creature named Rem, werewolf bounty hunter Silver, and </span><i><span>Wednesday</span></i><span>-coded necromancer Graves. Each hero brings a distinct presence to the roster, which is now made up of 38 misfits. Valve, however, didn’t add all six of them at once—rather, they’ve let the community vote on who they want to unlock first, with two heroes being released per week starting on January 26.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664618">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>People have indeed been showing up, making all sorts of fan art </span><a href="https://x.com/GrimboGrim/status/2015347283672641853"><span>championing</span></a><span> their </span><a href="https://x.com/spiritedby_moon/status/2015127369133285628"><span>faves</span></a><span> and asking others to vote for them, with votes being awarded by winning and taking part in matches. In-game, you can place sprays of propaganda posters displaying your candidate of choice, and some folks have seemingly spent a </span><a href="https://x.com/kelskiYT/status/2016286525299032410"><span>considerable amount of time</span></a><span> doing so. Considering that the MOBA continues to be available solely via invites from Steam friends and its </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/"><span>store page</span></a><span> is deliberately non-descriptive, the communal enthusiasm makes for a commendable contrast.</span></p> <p><span>So what’s </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> all about? Structurally and spiritually, it’s a MOBA. Matches can easily go to hell if your team is uncoordinated. Purchasing the right items based on your character’s strengths and weaknesses to put together a good build is a fundamental part of the experience. How well you farm resources (souls in </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>) in order to unlock and upgrade your hero’s abilities can easily turn the tide. You know, the usual.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yet the DNA shared with hero shooters is tangible. It’s present in how you control characters and how you face the action on the map. While everyone has different acrobatics to offer, they’re all intersected by the same mechanics, which are quite distinctive in the genre. You can dodge to the sides and in mid-air, wallrun, slide on the ground, mantle over ledges, and double jump. The maps themselves are designed with these maneuvers in mind: the latest update introduced vents and crawlspaces, adding yet another mobility layer. From their conception, however, maps encourage exploration, with plenty of alleyways to snake through and vertical architecture that’s ripe for the occasional rooftop fight. Speaking of which, melee attacks are quite important during combat, and you can even parry (and be parried).</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664619"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664619">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Jumping into a regular match can be disorienting to say the least, especially without prior knowledge of what to expect from characters or an idea of which items to get. Last week’s update, however, smartly added a new mode called Street Brawl, which is similar to ARAM in </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span>. In essence, it bitesizes the average 30-minute match by automatically pitting two 4v4 teams against each other on a single line, rather than the usual 6v6 across three lines, making it so that smackdowns are immediate, more intimate affairs.</span></p> <p><span>There’s also no farming or shopping involved in Street Brawl. Everyone starts each of the best-of-five rounds with equal resources, so you can access your four abilities from the jump and upgrade them often, and you’re offered three random item sets to pick from before plunging into the fray. In essence, Street Brawl lives up to its name by inviting you to focus on the fight. But there’s enough strategy involved to make it a great introduction to the overall game, as you get acclimated to heroes and maps without having to commit to longer matches where the stakes are higher, and everyone is, well, more stressed.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> draws influences from many sources, and it’s far from the first MOBA to experiment with more agile third-person experiences (see </span><i><span>Smite</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Paragon</span></i><span>, for example). At the same time, </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> oozes style in a way few other online games have accomplished, with fantasy, occult, and steampunk elements coexisting in harmony in its noir depiction of New York. There are dashes of </span><i><span>Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Hellboy</span></i><span> combined with the grit of a dive bar restroom in Bushwick, Brooklyn.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664648">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The simple act of countering the often gray and dull aesthetic of some MOBA and hero shooters—a trap that even Valve itself almost fell into with </span><a href="https://deadlock.wiki/Neon_Prime"><i><span>Neon Prime</span></i></a><span>, an early development of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> with a sci-fi aesthetic we’ve seen ad infinitum—is already a distinctive quality. Yet the aesthetic would simply be a charming backdrop if it weren’t for the strong cast of characters breathing life into the world.</span></p> <p><span>Take the freshly unlocked heroes as an example, which won the majority vote for this past week. Graves is a student necromancer who uses the dismembered hand of her mentor as a primary weapon, can summon flying skulls, and also create a gravestone that spawns ghouls over time. Rem, on the other hand, is a little sleepy guy who tosses his pillow at a distance, commands a group of (even smaller) minions that can collect loot and provide support to allies, and also puts foes in an area to sleep with his ultimate ability.</span></p>

 <p><span>Characters are, in essence, the single element that fosters longevity in MOBAs, offering fresh air to already established rosters. But aside from purely mechanical incentives, if they don’t look cool, what’s the point? It’s been apparent for some time that Valve is putting a great deal of attention into the design of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>’s characters, but this latest batch of heroes, alongside one last year that included a punk goat and not one but two vampires, are helping to solidify the art style, and in turn, the identity of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> altogether.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664649">©Valve</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are quite a few distinctive gameplay elements and visual features that set </span><i><span>Deadlock </span></i><span>apart, from the ziplines hovering over each of the lanes on a map that are used for traversal to the way chat text is displayed as dialogue bubbles under each character portrait. Yet it’s the hero roster I keep coming back for. Valve is clearly aware of the attention on them, as it continues to add </span><a href="https://x.com/deadlock/status/2017004723241415086"><span>dialogue interactions</span></a><span> between characters (et tu, </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>?) as well as smaller, nonetheless significant details like different portraits when a hero is on a killing spree or in a critical state.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s still early to say if </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> will become the next big thing. According to </span><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/"><span>SteamDB</span></a><span>, its all-time peak was 171,490 concurrent players, which happened shortly after the alpha launch in August 2024. According to Steam’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed"><span>official charts</span></a><span> as of the early hours of Friday, it has reached a 100,000 concurrent player peak, which hasn’t happened in a minute. While the numbers are obviously dwarfed by its older MOBA sibling, it’s not small either, especially since it remains an invite-only affair.</span></p> <p><span>Metrics aside, and regardless of whether the current momentum can last after the remaining four heroes are unlocked, I’m finding joy in this rare phase of </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span>. There isn’t a store, microtransactions, or a battle pass being shoved in my face. Ranked matches and rank distribution are absent, too, so that competitive edge is yet to influence how players engage with the game. And yes, the game is indeed still a work in progress, reflected in tech issues that pop up at random. At the heart of it all, though, the additions of the latest update seem to have finally brought the core experience to realization, while cementing the world and ambiance that engulfs it more firmly. What Valve decides to do next is a mystery. For now, I’m content with continuing to get to know its band of misfits, one brawl at a time.</span></p>

		<p>Respawn has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> will end support for the original Nintendo Switch with Season 29, meaning that the game will no longer be playable on that platform when Season 30 debuts on 4th August 2026.</p>
<p>While Apex Legends is leaving the older hybrid handheld behind, the game has had a native port for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> since last August, and cross-progression via an EA account means that player progress, purchases and unlocks can be carried over. Even so, the ability to buy in-game currency on Switch is being removed.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/10/apex-legends-switch-worth-playing-resolution-frame-rate-crossplay-graphics/">Apex Legends dropped onto Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>, and was another example of getting something that shouldn’t really run to work on the mobile chipset inside. It was a necessarily compromised experience in terms of resolution (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/09/apex-legends-nintendo-switch-resolution-and-frame-rate-when-is-it-out/">topping out at 720p docked and 576p handheld</a>) and frame rate (only shooting for 30fps). With the native Switch 2 version, all of that is dramatically improved to run at 60 fps and with 1080p docked and 1008p handheld.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement from social media:</p>
<p>Hey legends, we want to share an important update about Apex Legends on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Season 29 will be the final update for Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. Future seasons of Apex Legends will continue to be available on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), Apex Legends will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system.</li>
<li>Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.</li>
<li>Beginning August 4, 2026, in-game premium currency will no longer be available for purchase on Nintendo Switch, though any existing balances can still be used before August 4, 2026. Players can use any existing balances from Nintendo Switch on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
<li>All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts. Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026. Please note that in some regions, local laws require you to use digital currency within 180 days of purchase.</li>
<li>All the above only applies to Nintendo Switch and not Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apex Legends will continue to be available on all other supported platforms. As we continue to evolve Apex Legend’s content and technical foundation, our goal is to deliver a high quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the Nintendo community that has been with us on this journey since Day 1, and we hope to see you on the Dropship on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

While the 40+ level matchmaking option, Solo vs. Squads, was positioned by developer Embark Studios to be its big selling point, some players are more concerned with the return of an item duplication exploit and how it has affected the in-game (duck) economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqb1oq/evidence_of_a_bp_duplication_glitch_in_matches_we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no doubt</a> using the dupe glitch to amass piles of rare items like blueprints, it seems a few fans are manipulating the system to make some serious coin – and maybe even a quick joke. The duck has slowly become a bit of a running gag for fans on its own, as the squeaky bath toy is one of a few lightweight trinkets that can be found topside and then sold in Speranza for a decent chunk of Raider Coins. It also happens to be the sillier items in Arc Raiders, so when a recently patched dupe glitched returned in a new form, those looking to exploit the system knew just what to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who are discovering topside players with hundreds of ducks, however, are just confused.</p><p>Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/what_the_duck_is_this_we_found_two_dead_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a> a few days before the launch of Headwinds. “Dupe hacking gone wild? At first we thought it was some joke because the stash was just full of ducks but then we realized they were stacks of 15 ducks each.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay so I actually came across a guy in blue gate in a random house just spamming ducks on the ground,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/comment/o1lccl2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “I assumed he was duping. The floor was littered with them, probably like 100 of them. He wouldn't respond and kinda just stared at me til I walked away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ mallard problem has only gotten bigger in the aftermath of Headwinds, as the January content update also introduced a handful of more valuable (and more vibrant) ducks to collect as part of the new Bird City map condition. It’s resulted in an abundance of ducks across Buried City…and some very awkward moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A raider caught on fire in Buried City Metro, went down without saying a word, and left behind a mountain of Familiar Ducks,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqv3yd/a_raider_caught_on_fire_in_buried_city_metro_went/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user shared</u></a>. “I extracted with $2.8M.

DDOS (Duck Duplication on Server).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game that constantly sees players backstabbing each other for a small chance to net worthwhile resources, it’s hard to deny the comedy in PvP players only finding stacks upon stacks of little rubber duckies. Still, it’s definitely the kind of thing Embark <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">promised to clean up earlier this month</a>. Players have complained of cheaters and exploiters in Arc Raiders for weeks, so as goofy as these issues are, they are still causing some players to worry that others have an unfair advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's especially concerning for those who have kept up with Arc Raiders updates since launch. Embark <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-12-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued update 1.12.0</a> January 20 and fixed a handful of exploits, including an item duplication glitch. It took less than a week for players to begin reporting what appears to be a new version of the exploit, and it's unclear how long it will take for the developers to publish a new patch or how many other glitches will be discovered in the meantime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders cheater crackdown has seen <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">holes plugged in Stella Montis</a> to try and ward off wall explolits, while some players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-tfue-hit-with-30-day-arc-raiders-ban-amid-cheater-purge-then-immediately-unbanned">like streamer Tfue</a>, have found themselves banned (and then unbanned) without notice. As Embark tries to bring cheats to a halt, players are still finding the fun both in and outside of the game.

We finally made it to the end of January! There was quite a bit of Nintendo news this week, so we're sure everyone will enjoy kicking back with a couple o' games over the weekend.</p>
<p>We were treated to yet another Nintendo Direct this week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> taking the spotlight.

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">ACNH</a> done got me again. It's like a transporter incident has sent me back to 2020 and I'm once again finding solace in New Horizons' custom design tool, slowly crafting Star Trek-related patterns for my own amusement, watching hours zoom by as I move a single 'pixel' one square to the left and check the result. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dartmonkey.bsky.social/post/3mdntjiik6k2h">It's a happy place.</a></p>
<p>I'm steadily turning my upstairs room into Ten Forward, although I'm painfully aware that in the game somewhere, there must be better furniture to customise and more accurate green drinks to craft, which I just haven't found yet. I've even taken to working through the dreary DLC, hoping to access more cool items. Send help.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> for what feels like one hundred years, and I've JUST seen my first real indication that Uchikoshi is up to his usual nonsense. I knew he was, that crafty devil! It's so good, although I will say that A) it must have been a nightmare to review, and B) you can really tell where the frosting gets a bit thin. They've definitely shaved the plot almost to nothing in some places just to achieve the illusion of overall fullness. But, eh, I don't mind! The bits that aren't thin are pretty darn great, and there's more writing in this than I've probably read in a year.</p>
<p>Other than that, I bought a few cheapy games in the Steam Sale — <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862670/Shelldiver/">Shelldiver</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3069810/Rocket_Rats/">Rocket Rats</a>, most notably, from the same developer. They're well-polished little incremental games, and they very much give me the feeling that this developer has what amounts to a well-oiled factory machine for making incremental games in his head. I bet he can crank these out as soon as he has the inkling of a new idea. Honestly, I have such a huge respect for developers that can do that! Making games in a particular genre is like working out a muscle — it sucks and hurts and takes forever at first, but then it becomes second nature. Having the basic frameworks already built helps a lot, too!</p>
<p>Oh, god, I just read that the developer is only 25. Gonna go lie down and have an existential crisis. Gagonfe, if you're reading this, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.</p>
<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I reckon it's pretty predictable what my games will be this week! After rolling credits on Dispatch, I know I'll be diving back in this weekend in an attempt to change up my ending and explore more of the what-ifs from my original playthrough. Knowing me, I'll likely rummage the eShop for some Telltale Games I may have missed out. Other than that, it's likely another weekend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> or finally starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on my trusty 2DS when it arrives!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Made my way to chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, loving it! But being a confused antisocial military bad boy who somehow is the love interest of three brilliant non-existent women is not the only fun way to spend the weekend: I have picked up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283160/House_of_the_Dying_Sun/">House of the Dying Sun</a> on PC, and it is brilliant! I always loved the <strong>Starblade</strong> / <strong>Star Fox</strong> untextured polygon aesthetic, and this game takes it to the absolute extreme with combined fleet micro management. <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> is proving to be a rather solid wrestling title, but a bit too much of a grind for my tastes. It will take me forever to unlock the playable roster, but it does help that I was a fan of the PS2 original. It remains better than the current Switch 2 offerings.</p>
<p>My game of the week is GRID Legends: Gold Edition. I will finally fully recover my investment on the GameCube controller for Switch 2 because no way I will ever play this without the analogue triggers. I was oblivious that the story mode for this uses old-school full-motion video and actors, which gives it a bit of nostalgic charm. I will be spending the next few weeks quite entertained in the virtual tarmac.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Last week was good timing for picking up a copy of Tomodachi Life, eh? Yes, I've been diving back into the 3DS original over the last few days, and I had forgotten how much I love this silly little game! I've scanned in all of the celebs (obviously), and have been dropping in every day to see what's happening with Reggie, Shaq, Christina Aguilera, Miyamoto and... Zendaya? I caught Aonuma rolling around his apartment floor the other day. GOTY stuff, right there.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>While a chunk of my time has been spent playing a game for review (more on that next week), Animal Crossing has taken up most of my Switch 2 gaming. We've been snowed in basically all week here in central Ohio, so not much good trying to go out and have a social life.</p>
<p>But I've mainly been catching up on an RPG white whale, which I'm shocked isn't on Switch: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/valkyrie_profile">Valkyrie Profile</a>. What a weird, cool game — triAce esoterica aside, I love the tone and combat here. It's perfect for handheld play. Thank goodness for the PlayStation Portal... I'm eyeing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, but February is looking stacked. So we'll see. Keep warm, folks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed the first major collaboration between Escape from Tarkov and another game, and it’s been brewing for weeks. In a post on social media, the team unveiled the ‘Escape from Tarkov x Escape from Duckov’ crossover event, and while nobody knows what it entails, it was promised that it’s <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve seen teasers posted by both Battlestate Games and Team Soda, the developer behind the satirical extraction shooter, Escape from Duckov. Now it’s time to make good on those teases.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-duckov-is-coming-to-tarkov">Escape from Duckov is Coming to Tarkov</h2>



<p>A new image posted on social media confirmed that the Escape from Duckov and Escape from <strong>Tarkov </strong>crossover is indeed happening. We don’t know <strong>when</strong>, but the team at Battlestate Games promised it would be <strong>soon</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s just over a year since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/">Escape from Duckov</a> was released, emerging as a jokey extraction game that amassed a very real and surprising audience. It plunges players into a hardcore extraction concept populated by birds, mostly ducks, and gives them all the tools of the trade that we’d usually associate with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>That means customizable weapons, vendors, multiple maps, a hideout to build, and multiple quests.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What started as something of a joke has become something much more tangible, and now Escape from Tarkov’s developers are open to making Duckov the sole target of the first-ever cross-game collaboration in the EFT space.</p>



<p>While we don’t know what the crossover will include, fans have been quick to speculate on social media. Some are predicting seeing ducks running rampant around Tarkov’s maps, while others have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/">used earlier teasers</a> to guess that Tarkov’s bosses will be reimagined in Duckov as… Well, <em>ducks</em>.</p>



<p>And they’d be mostly right! On the <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/2017432651918131223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov side</a>, it was confirmed that the collaboration arrives in <strong>that game </strong>on February 10, and it includes a new map, ‘festival content’, and Tarkov bosses reimagined in duck form. Happy days!</p>

<p>The port is already well underway</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="5cc6f40c0e93e"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc6f40c0e93e/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>We heard recently from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi how the follow up games to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">Switch 2 would have "exactly the same" gameplay</a> as other platforms, so when exactly can we expect the next title?</p>
<p>Speaking to Polygon recently, Hamaguchi mentioned how a status update on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will hopefully be shared in the "very near future". So far, this version of the game has been built, and the team is now working hard to optimise and polish it. Here's the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Polygon:</strong> "Hamaguchi’s next challenge is bringing <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em> to Switch 2. Though <em>Remake</em> runs great on the console, <em>Rebirth</em> is a significantly larger game, complete with small but intricately detailed open-world zones. Hamaguchi says that the engineering team is handling that tall task well so far, to the point where the port is already far along in development."</p>
<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi:</strong> “At this point, we have gotten the game built. Our engineers are working hard to optimize and to provide the final polish on the build. I’m hoping that we’ll be able to provide more information on <em>Rebirth</em> in the very near future. Compared to the first title, the world map is a lot larger, so there is no doubt that it’s a more challenging production process. But our engineers are very passionate about the work that they’re doing, so I’m confident that we’ll be able to deliver.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebirth was released on the PlayStation 5 in 2024. At the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">our colleagues at <strong>Push Square</strong></a> gave the title eight out of ten stars calling it a great sequel that retained all of the Remake's most important strengths while building on an already brilliant combat system, which excelled at showcasing the iconic RPG setting.</p>
<p>This update about the Switch 2 version of Rebirth follows the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade earlier this month on Nintendo's new hybrid system. A demo is also available on the Switch 2, if you want to test it out first.</p>
