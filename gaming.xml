            <p>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">that one</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lords-of-the-fallen">This one</a>. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of <em>exactly </em>the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.</p>

<p>Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fallen 3, The The Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fall3n or whatever they decide to call it, before undoubtedly rechristening it later on for maximum confusion, was revealed by a bit of paperwork filed by publishers CI Games and spotted by Polish financial outlet <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html">Bankier</a>.</p>
<p>The paperwork filed on June 14th pertains to a partnership between CI Games and Epic to give the latter lifetime exclusive distribution rights to the game - currently referred to internally as Project 3. That means you can expect it to be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, though it’ll also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The document also notes that CI Games expects to release Lords of tres Fallen sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-review">our review</a>, Ed found Lords of the Fallen (2023) to be a serviceable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> waylaid by a litany of irritating issues - from an awkward camera to performance wobbles - that took away from its highlights, notably its dimension-hopping lantern mechanic.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen devs Hexworks laid off several of their team at the start of the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">as part of redundancies across CI Games</a>. Regardless, the studio have continued to support the game, capping off their patches <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-steam-reviews-improve-as-performance-patch-lands-devs-advise-players-not-to-use-graphics-settings-their-rigs-cannot-handle">targeting performance improvements</a> and balancing with a final update that added a randomised New Game+ mode and Ironman modifier in April <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-latest-update-adds-cruel-modifiers-that-turn-it-into-a-roguelike">that together effectively turn the game into a roguelike</a>.</p>

<p>Netflix’s efforts to grow its gaming front seem to be succeeding, at least in one area. According to new data compiled by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/rockstars-gta-trilogy-hits-30m-downloads-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mobilegamer.biz</a>, the GTA Trilogy has been downloaded over 30 million times on Netflix Games.</p>



<p>The data, which comes from Appmagic, shows that GTA San Andreas has been installed 20.5 million times by players. GTA Vice City sits at 6.5 million installs while GTA 3 has 3.3 million. </p>



<p>As far as the devices being played on, iOS has seen 15.8 million installs of San Andreas compared to 4.7 million on Android. For Vice City, that breakdown is 4.9 million on iOS and 1.6 on Android while GTA 3 had 2.4 million players on iOS and just 929,000 on Android. Lastly, most of the players come from the United States with each game having more than 23% of a U.S. player base.</p>



<p>Netflix continues to invest in its gaming department. As of December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-has-90-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 90 games were in development</a> for the platform.</p>

<p>As the PC gaming market continues to grow, more and more players are looking for reasons to game on the go. To do that properly, however, you likely want a powerful laptop to make sure you can do what you want, when you want, and how you want. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop is one of MSI’s premium gaming laptops that packs the punch you want for high-end performance.</p>



<p>Retailing at $3,000, it’s a pricey computer but comes loaded with everything you’d need to make sure it’s something that will satisfy you for years before needing to upgrade. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop I reviewed comes with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>I’ve used the laptop as my daily driver for the better part of three months to get a feel for how it works under regular and heavy use. So is the MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop one worth picking up, even today, to be your PC solution?</p>

<h2 id="h-msi-raider-ge78-hx-review">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review</h2>



<h3 id="h-day-to-day-usage"><strong>Day-to-Day Usage</strong></h3>



<p>While everyone loves synthetic benchmark numbers, they aren’t usually indicative of how people will actually use their machine. So, to test this laptop, the focus was on playing games, capturing content, and editing videos.  What is it like if the MSI Raider GE78 HX was going to be your primary computer?</p>



<p>Let’s start with games. The games played for the purpose of testing the laptop were  Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, XDefiant, Cyberpunk 2077, and Doom Eternal.</p>



<p>Whatever you want to play, this laptop can handle it. Doom Eternal regularly hit 250-300 frames per second (FPS). CyberPunk 2077, a more resource-intensive game, peaked around 85 FPS while stayed at 61-66 FPS on average. Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, during the most intense in-game action with military on scree, averaged around 115 FPS. Lastly, XDefiant — the newest game on this list — was averaging over 300 FPS. All in all, it’s a great experience when gaming.</p>



<p>Video rendering was fast with five-minute, 1440p videos rendering in less than two minutes. That same video in 4K was done in less than four. Obviously the more transitions, cuts, and edits you have, the longer it might take. But for the average content creator, you will have no issues working on this.</p>



<p>Should you just want to watch movies and videos, the 17-inch 2560×1600 240hz screen is pretty good. The blacks could be better on high brightness, but you shouldn’t find too much to be upset about with the IPS display.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-some-concerns">Some Concerns</h3>



<p>It’s not all roses with the MSI Raider GE78 HX, though. One problem I do have is just how loud the fans get when using it. No matter what you do, the fans will, at times, sound like they are getting ready to send the machine to the sky. Still, even with the high fan usage and volume, I noticed that it did get quite warm to the touch. It’s not a machine you’ll want to sit on your lap without a cooling pad or lap desk underneath it. It also can become a tad bit uncomfortable to the touch, especially at the top end of the keyboard, when using it for extended periods. If gaming, I highly recommend a controller or using an external mouse and keyboard if the games being played are intensive.</p>



<p>Another concern is battery life. It’s too inconsistent to know just how good the life is. Sometimes, it would last over five hours. Other times, I was lucky to get over two hours on a full charge. If you want to just spend your time in a game without being plugged in, expect your time to be closer to the two hour-mark, if not less. Playing games like XDefiant or even Diablo 4 at the highest settings say the battery last just over an hour before needing to be plugged in. So while you can definitely game on the go with this machine, it’s still best to keep your power brick handy and ready just in case. </p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall, there’s no doubt that the MSI Raider GE78 HX is a powerful computer. It does pretty much everything you’d want from a machine like this. However, when people are looking at gaming laptops, portability might be at the top of their list. The MSI Raider GE78 HX, despite it’s great performance when gaming, creating, or really anything, is a bulky machine that doesn’t really scream “on-the-go gaming”.</p>



<p>That said, if you either travel a lot where you can’t drag a desktop PC with you or you have limited real estate at home where a laptop fits perfectly, then this laptop makes sense even at it’s high price point. It really is going to come down to your specific use case. There’s also a chance you can get one at a lower price point as it’s been on the market for a little while now.</p>

Just kidding, of course, he won't teach you tickle attacks. He will teach you how to become as shredded as him, though. Okay, that's probably not true either. What is true: You get to work out with Kenshiro.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

"Its fundamentals are incredibly easy to understand, even if you're unfamiliar with poker, but the ways in which it works within the game's boundaries (and often breaks free from them) injects a level of depth to each hand to play that's both challenging and rewarding to continually engage with. It's a game that will melt away time as you hit play on one run after the next, with each defeat never stinging long enough to dissuade the possibility of victory on the next."</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced the launch date of Overwatch 2 Season 11: Super Mega Ultrawatch, two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-10-venture-clash-mode-alignment-swap-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of Season 10</a>. The new season will be available starting this Thursday, June 20, adding a new Mythic cosmetic type, a Push map, the return of Pink Mercy (with the proceed of her cosmetic items going fully to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation), new Hero Mastery Missions, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Runapasi Push Map:</strong> Hike your way to this hidden city in the Peruvian Andes in Overwatch 2's latest push map. This map features narrow streets and nods to the local culture, including the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. Play it in Quick Play and Competitive upon the launch of Season 11.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hero Mastery:</strong> Sharpen your kunai and master your aim when the Hero Mastery single-player courses for both Kiriko and Soldier: 76 launch this season. Take on new challenges and earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP during a limited-time event from June 20 through July 9.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Pink Mercy for a Cause:</strong> Celebrating the power of Overwatch 2's 100 million-player community, Pink Mercy returns to the store on June 25 with a new Rose Gold Mercy bundle. 100% of the proceeds from these items will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mythic Weapon Skins:</strong> Coming with the Mid-Season Update, players will unlock cool-looking Mythic Weapon Skins. Similar to Heroic Weapon Skins, these come with exclusive sound and visual effects. Redeem Mythic Prisms to earn and upgrade Mythic Weapons to slay in style, starting with the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt Weapon Skin, coming July 23.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Premium Battle Pass for Overwatch 2 Season 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Up to 80 Mythic Prisms</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">5 Legendary Skins (Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn already confirmed)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lifeguard Lucio Epic Skin</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">500 Credits</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Souvenirs, Weapon Charms, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Everything in the Free Battle Pass, including two additional Epic skins, 600 Overwatch Coins, an additional 1,500 Credits, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, with a new Overwatch 2 season, there are also several balance improvements to the heroes and the maps. Cassidy has swapped her Magnetic Grenade for a new and improved Flashbang that slows foes in their tracks. The glass on the Colosseo push map has been removed, along with other changes that will allow team fights to take place all over the streets of Rome.</p>

<p>Blizzard is also making weekly challenges more accessible. If you miss a week, you can catch up on the previous week’s challenges before working on the current ones. Weekly milestone rewards are easier to achieve than before, too. Completing three weekly challenges provides 20,000 XP. As each week passes, a new milestone reward becomes available.</p>

  <p id="5WXt9A"><strong>Season 11</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-guide"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> will be a comparatively smaller one for Blizzard’s free-to-play shooter. Players won’t get a new hero this season, but they will get a new map, new Hero Mastery courses, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176406/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-skin-rerelease-blizzard-charity">the return of Pink Mercy</a>.</p>
<p id="7u5NJQ">Of course, there will also be a new battle pass. The theme for season 11 is Super Mega Ultrawatch, with kaiju and tokusatsu-inspired skins for heroes like Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn. Ashe is the recipient of season 11’s Mythic skin, turning her into a Rita Repulsa-like.</p>
<p id="tamR4W">Oh, and there’s a Transformers collaboration coming to <em>Overwatch 2</em>?! Seems like season 11 will have more than meets the eye...</p>
<hr id="HwufZJ">

<p id="lRh8UJ"><em>Overwatch 2</em> season 11 starts on <strong>Thursday, June 20</strong>. There’s no official release time yet, but in-game events typically launch at <strong>2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m. PDT </strong>in the United States, so we can expect something similar for the launch of season 11. This means the update will likely be available at these times:</p>

<p id="wLws7c">The first new Push map in more than 20 months, Runasapi, will give players a new location to escort the robot across in season 11. Runasapi is set in the Peruvian Andes, and serves as support hero Ilari’s hometown. Here’s how Blizzard describes Runasapi, which will be available to play in Quick Play and Competitive this season:</p>
<blockquote><p id="Q3010q">Amble through marketplaces full of fresh produce and pay a visit to the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. This exciting Push map is vibrant and challenging as you escort TS-1 through tight streets. Watch out as some fights may take place precariously close to the steep cliffs overlooking the sunny farmlands below.</p></blockquote>
<p id="c6RHq7">Another Push map, Colosseo, is getting a slight rework, with changes to structures near spawns and the removal of glass barriers in the hallway at the center of the map.</p>
<h3 id="l4ArY7"><strong>Season 11 battle pass and Mythic skin(s)</strong></h3>

<p id="w4qBOJ">I hope you like Super Sentai styling, because season 11 is rife with bug-eyed heroes and Godzilla-adjacent skins for Genji, Reaper, Sojourn, Roadhog, Zenyatta, Wrecking Ball, and others. Mauga’s vacation look is also here as one of the skins included in the season 11 premium battle pass.</p>

<p id="hRcFcX">In season 11, Blizzard will introduce a new type of Mythic cosmetic: Mythic Weapon Skins. First out of the gate is the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt weapon skin, coming July 23, which spruces up Reinhardt’s rocket hammer with the fury of a demon. Like Mythic hero skins, the new type of weapon skin costs 50 Mythic Prisms, with additional levels of customization unlocked with 10 Mythic Prisms. Upgrades include a weapon flourish emote, elimination visual effects, and reactive effects.</p>
<h3 id="lI5rAu"><strong>Hero reworks and Mastery Courses</strong></h3>
<p id="CPOIi3">Blizzard is buffing heroes across all three roles, but Cassidy is getting the biggest change of all. His Magnetic Grenade is going bye-bye and his Flashbang is coming back. The new version of Flashbang will slow enemies, rather than outright lockstun them.</p>
<p id="csBBHu">Kiriko and Soldier: 76 will get new Hero Mastery single-player courses in season 11, and players can take part in a limited-time challenge event with them from June 20 to July 9. Doing so will earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP.</p>
<h3 id="TOaRB2"><strong>Summer Games 2024 and Transformers</strong></h3>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/as-starfield-steam-reviews-plunge-to-mostly-negative-todd-howard-responds-to-paid-mods-backlash<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are going to take a look at that."</h2></div><section><p>Bethesda Game Studios chief Todd Howard has responded to a backlash over <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> paid mods, confirming the developer will look at its pricing model for Creations content.</p><p>On Steam, Starfield’s recent user reviews are now on ‘Mostly Negative’ after disgruntled players hit out at Bethesda for charging $7 for a single Starfield mission. The second mission of the recently released Trackers Alliance is only available as a Starfield Creation and costs $7, or 700 credits.</p><p>Creations are built via Starfield’s Creation Kit, and include free and paid-for mods. Creations include new missions, gear, skins, and weapons. Here’s the official blurb from Bethesda:</p><blockquote>Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!</blockquote><blockquote>The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/17/trackers-alliance-1718635757766.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Trackers Alliance's second mission has sparked a backlash.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While this latest backlash revolves around The Vulture mission, Bethesda has faced criticism over paid mods before. Indeed it’s the studio’s continued effort to enable paid mods for its games that has rubbed some players up the wrong way.</p><p>“Really? Another push for curated paid mods no one asked for?” reads one negative Steam review. “There is a simple reason why many players and modders enjoy modding their games for decades: it is done as a hobby, for players by players, without corporate responsibilites and apart from donation opportunities, without asking for or expecting monetary compensation.</p><p>“You are not aiding modding in the slightest. You are trying to turn modding into a business opportunity, to be a parasite that profits from underpaid work you do not want to do yourselves.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Todd Howard responded directly to the criticism, and confirmed plans to look again at Bethesda’s pricing for Creations content.</p><p>“We hear that feedback, too,” Howard said. “First of all I’ll say that stuff gets priced based on things that we've done before both in Creation Club and then Fallout 76, and we're always trying to be looking at what else is out there, really make sure we're giving value to everybody and where we're not, hey you know, we definitely will adjust.</p><p>“The one thing I want to say on The Trackers Alliance, that was really an attempt to something we did in Creation Club where we'd say, hey you get this special outfit and you get this special weapon, we wanted to put them together, and then thought, let's go the extra mile and wrap those around a quest.</p><p>“But now we definitely see the feedback right? And that's not what we want at all in terms of, oh no, this looks like a faction that we're chopping up and then selling for 700 credits at a time. And so I do think we are going to take a look at that and how we deliver content like that, and whether we're changing pricing or breaking it up or what we should do there. So, great feedback from the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield: Shattered Space Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Howard insisted, however, that Bethesda’s policy on paid mods has the health of the modding community at heart.</p><p>“As it comes to, particularly the creators out there, look, our view is, a lot of them have gone from hobbyists to professionals. And it’s part of our job to make sure they can do that and they do get paid and they see the monetary rewards if they make awesome content,” Howard said.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2">Howard has confirmed plans to release a second story expansion for Starfield</a> following this year’s Shattered Space, and commented on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while">the long development of The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Nintendo also tempered expectations, stating that this upcoming showcase would focus on games headed to its hybrid game console in the latter half of this year. Additionally, this showcase was previously confirmed not to include any reveal of the console rumored to succeed the Nintendo Switch. </p><p>While we do not know what is on the Switch slate for the second half of this year, at the last Nintendo Direct, some games we know confirmed to release on Switch in 2025 include <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware.903492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When BioWare announced that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf had been renamed Dragon Age: The Veilguard, general manager Gary McKay explained the decision was rooted in a wish to reflect the game’s “really deep and compelling group of companions.” It's a logical pivot considering the immense cultural effect Baldur’s Gate 3’s collection of misfit heroes triggered last year. BioWare no doubt hopes that at least one of the Veilguard will resonate at a scale akin to Asterion, Karlach, or Shadowheart. </p><p>A camp of companions is about as far as the similarities with Baldur’s Gate 3 goes though, if the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-the-veilguard-official-gameplay-reveal-video">recently showcased 20 minutes</a> of gameplay is to go by. Dragon Age: The Veilguard appears to be a cinematic fantasy adventure with linear momentum, action combat, and huge set-piece moments. Little of what was shown could correlate with Baldur’s Gate 3’s expansive and reactive world. And that’s okay because Dragon Age is not Baldur’s Gate. BioWare is not Larian. And nor should they be. Rather than attempting to hit Baldur’s Gate’s lofty standards, Dragon Age: The Veilguard should instead be seeking to resurrect BioWare’s golden era. An era that produced very different RPGs to what Larian does.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Before we start, it’s worth recognising that the term ‘BioWare’s golden era’ will mean different things to different people. For some, it’ll be the Infinity Engine years – the time of deep, crunchy CRPGs like the original Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. For what I suspect is many more people (myself included), it’s the 2007-2014 period of epic and emotional choice-driven storytelling, best demonstrated by the Mass Effect trilogy and Dragon Age. Seeded by Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’s need to offer a choice between the light and dark side of the Force, BioWare became more interested in the narrative spun by good dungeon masters rather than organic player-driven adventures. As a result, the studio found itself progressively less invested in systemic rules and dice rolls, instead putting all of its efforts into crafting unforgettable stories around a player. The biggest, most impactful moments would be the consequences of weighty decisions that formed narrative tent poles. </p><p>The shift from pre-rendered isometric environments to fully 3D worlds enabled BioWare to push its storytelling ambition, with conversations shot like TV dialogue and set-pieces scripted to appear like blockbuster movies. It’s a format that proved hugely influential on the likes of CD Projekt Red, but has somehow remained singular in video game history. Fans now lament the absence of “BioWare-style RPGs”, which disappeared following the shaky Mass Effect: Andromeda and disastrous live-service shooter Anthem. Meanwhile, renewed interest in old-school RPG design means genre trends have shifted. Companies like Larian, Obsidian, and Owlcat have found ways to advance and evolve BioWare’s original, more systems-driven template, resulting in the likes of Pillars of Eternity, Pathfinder, and Baldur’s Gate 3.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The magic of BioWare’s glory days is singular, and still just as valuable to the RPG space as any of Larian’s most important offerings.</p></div><p>With old-school being the norm these days, it’s now the gameplay showcase for Dragon Age: The Veilguard that’s a blast from the past. It feels nostalgic, so much so it seems that we <em>could</em> be on the verge of a BioWare renaissance. Depicting a quest from very early in the game, the 20-minute demonstration carries the same sense of cinematic spectacle and drama that powers some of BioWare’s best moments. Tonally and structurally, it reminded me a lot of Dragon Age: Inquisition’s ‘Here Lies The Abyss’ quest, which saw the party push forward through a besieged castle to eventually clash with a group of Grey Wardens conducting a demonic ritual. This Veilguard quest, however, carries even greater weight because it is Solas that awaits at the climax of the demo: Inquisition’s ally-turned-enemy and the Dreadwolf himself. </p><p>There’s such a strong sense of character in this sequence, both in terms of the personalities within it and the atmosphere of the entire event. It is unmistakably BioWare storytelling. And, despite this being a snapshot shown entirely out of context, the scene successfully conveys the narrative stakes; as fan-favourite dwarf Varric attempts to talk down Solas from his god-summoning ritual, the conversation carries the weight of their former friendship and the uncertainty of the Dreadwolf’s deception. Watching for the first time, I even questioned if BioWare was about to kill Varric off in what is effectively a trailer, which is testament to how well the demo’s writing conveys threat and how strongly it is anchored in the previous Dragon Age stories. </p><p>This effect makes sense when you consider the people working behind the scenes. While detractors like to focus on the key figures who have left BioWare, it’s worth noting that The Veilguard’s creative director, John Epler, is a 17-year studio veteran who was a cinematic designer during the era of Dragon Age: Inquisition, a role dedicated to delivering story beats. Additionally, many of the project’s longest-serving BioWare staff are writers who have penned games as far back as Dragon Age: Origins. The right hands are here to ensure The Veilguard delivers another strong Dragon Age tale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, Dragon Age isn’t just a story. It’s an RPG, a genre that has evolved significantly since Inquisition released a decade ago. But it is unfair to expect The Veilguard to pilfer from and build upon Baldur’s Gate 3, a game that was only fully launched less than 12 months ago and was built by a team approximately twice as large as BioWare’s current staff roster. However, it <em>is</em> vital that BioWare doesn’t ignore the genre’s recent achievements, especially in the areas that its golden era recipe was once a leader. That means stronger, more impactful, and more nuanced reactivity when it comes to narrative choices. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s story cannot simply branch into binary pathways at every decision; there needs to be deep, long-held consequences across the entire narrative experience.</p><p>While the demo’s brevity means it isn’t able to showcase how Veilguard’s approach to narrative choice works, there are nonetheless small glimpses that provide hope. You are able to select a background for your protagonist, Rook, during character creation, and that history is said to impact how you navigate the story. The demo makes a couple of references to the Shadow Dragons background (a resistance group from Tevinter who opposes the mage imperium’s corrupt leadership), suggesting that your character’s traits will impact dialogue, relationships, and opportunities. Longterm fans will recognise this as an echo of the first Dragon Age’s origin stories, but I’m actually reminded of the tag system from Larian’s Divinity: Original Sin 2, in which key traits such as race and class would open up new dialogue trees where appropriate. I’m hoping that BioWare has crafted its own version of this system to ensure our Rooks feel significant within their own story. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Veilguard completes Dragon Age’s full transition into action combat with a system that looks to do for swords and sorcery what Mass Effect did for rifles and telekinesis.</p></div><p>The big question is how any new approach to character choices will fold into the larger structure. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview">interview with IGN</a>, game director Corinne Busche explained that Veilguard is “a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated.” It’s a design that will presumably feel akin to the linear main quest chain that runs through the core of Dragon Age: Inquisition. Or, more likely, Mass Effect 2 (arguably the pinnacle of BioWare’s work in this ‘cinematic RPG’ field.) That means we can thankfully say goodbye to the MMO-like bloat of Inquisition’s busy work-filled hubs, but potentially at the cost of a world that feels alive, organic, and reactive. The narrowed scope means the focus may entirely be on character narrative – a perfectly valid approach, but one that can’t use the same toolkit as Baldur’s Gate 3. Where Larian crafted a <em>world </em>that reacts to your every move, BioWare should focus on building a <em>story </em>that reacts to your every decision. </p><p>To some, that will sound like a low-level ambition. But let’s face it, BioWare has been in a bad place for a decade and realistically needs to get back to what it was good at before it leaps too far into the unknown. That also means addressing its pre-Anthem faults too, which brings us to combat. Without beating around the bush, combat in Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition sucks. Their design points to a reluctance by BioWare to admit it had moved on from the Infinity Engine era of real time-with-pause battles, and so what we were given was a hybrid action system that was unfulfilling both tactically and mechanically. While I do pine for the robust tactical combat of old, that’s what we have modern CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate 3 for. And so thankfully Veilguard completes Dragon Age’s full transition into action combat with a system that looks to do for swords and sorcery what Mass Effect did for rifles and telekinesis. It appears active and impactful, with an even mix of character abilities and skill-based mechanics. Hopefully it will offer something much more engaging than Inquisition’s barely readable slog-fests. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ability-wheel-1718361924441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>While combat is now fully action-led, hopefully the Ability Wheel will offer solid tactical depth.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While I welcome Dragon Age’s shift to proper action combat, I do still hope it’s more reliant on tactics and squad command than Mass Effect. The series’ roots still need to be acknowledged, and so I wish the demo showed more of the new Ability Wheel, which can be used to issue commands to your two NPC allies. While the party size is down by one member, I do hope that Veilguard’s battles are still built on a foundation of interesting interplay between fighters. A screenshot featuring much more developed characters than those in the gameplay demo shows an Ability Wheel populated by skills that can combine and ‘detonate’, indicating the Power Combos system from Mass Effect Andromeda (one of its few good ideas) has been adapted for Dragon Age. It’s stuff like this that makes me hopeful that Veilguard will offer the best Dragon Age combat since Origins, even if it’s of an entirely different format.</p><p>At a time when Baldur’s Gate 3 is incontestably the strongest RPG ever made, it’s understandable to be a little surprised that Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks so unlike it, especially considering the series was developed as the spiritual successor to BioWare’s original Baldur’s Gate games. But while those roots are experiencing an unprecedented surge of new popularity, we shouldn’t forget BioWare’s golden ‘cinematic RPG’ era was really, <em>really</em> good. Dragon Age: Inquisition’s story and relationships remain top-notch. Dragon Age 2’s detonation of the Chantry is one of the most memorable moments in Western RPGs. Mass Effect 2 is one of the greatest games ever made. These games may be not be as systemically advanced as the best RPGs of the moment, but they gave us stories and characters that stir significant emotions in players both old and new to this day. The magic of BioWare’s glory days is singular, and still just as valuable to the RPG space as any of Larian’s most important offerings. If it's back, then that's nothing but a good thing. </p><p>But don’t just take it from me. As Larian’s own publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1800586064589128019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Douse recently tweeted</a>: “Two deliberately very different games (which is good) joined thematically by a few principle vibes (character, narrative, romance) that should be enjoyed as part of a giant RPG buffet.”</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield: Shattered Space Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Howard said Starfield has now seen 14 million players following its launch on PC, Xbox Series X and S and straight into Xbox subscription service Game Pass, although Bethesda has yet to announce a sales figure. The game’s first story expansion, Shattered Space, launches later in 2024, with its debut trailer revealed during Microsoft’s recent Xbox Games Showcase event.</p><p>During the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MrMattyPlays</u></a> asked Howard if it is Bethesda’s intention to continue to release annual story expansions for Starfield. Howard replied: “More or less, yeah. How long that continues, hopefully a very long time, but we're planning for the one after this, so there will be another one.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Content wise, we're looking at what we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4.</p></div><p>As for Shattered Space itself, Howard revealed interesting details about its size and scope, likening it to the well-received Fallout 4 DLC Far Harbor.</p><p>“One of the things we always liked about it from the get-go, but I don’t think people realize, is Shattered Space, the bulk of that expansion pack, once you get to the city and the planet, it takes place there. It allows us to build a landscape like we would traditionally do and have the city and the quest. And so that story takes place there.</p><p>“Content wise, we're looking at what we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4. This is a scope that works for our development in doing this annual story expansion type of thing. So really excited about that, and it lets us do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it's still Starfield, but this new kind of alien world that you're able to explore and it takes place there.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One common criticism of Starfield is that exploration is spread too thin across a thousand planets, many of which were deemed barren as a result of procedural generation. This is in contrast to previous Bethesda games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, which are set in focused areas filled with hand-crafted cities and other points of interest.</p><p>Howard said Shattered Space, which sounds like a more traditional Bethesda experience, is not necessarily a response to that criticism, but the studio’s internal reaction to the game it had made. “It wasn't a reaction,” Howard insisted. “It was our own reaction that we had as well.”</p><p>It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while">It’s working on the aforementioned Elder Scrolls 6</a>, ongoing content for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, various mobile games, updates for older games, and, eventually, the next Fallout.</p><p>But will Starfield see a sequel? If it does materialize it may be some time before we see anything of it, with Elder Scrolls 6 expected no earlier than 2028 and another Fallout game set to follow.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The only way to free oneself from it is if they let themselves get killed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Juxtapose moments of silent dread with bouts of terror"><span>Juxtapose moments of silent dread with bouts of terror</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the same way that a game needs to provide varying vibes to keep the atmosphere from feeling static over several hours of gameplay, horror titles need to provide a contrast and balance between quiet moments and pulse-pounding ones to ensure players never know what to expect around the proverbial corner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By doing so, a horror setting can make itself routine-proof—meaning that gamers won’t be able to form habits of any kind that can make their playstyle efficient at the cost of negated challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This can be anything from the way players deal with monsters blocking their path to how they expect a specific kind of scripted event to play out in any given sublocation. Whatever the gameplay aspect, players must never feel like they’re in complete control of their circumstances and/or surroundings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides, the first step to destroying the avatar’s sanity is to shatter their expectations about what they may find on the other side of a door, deep in the basement, or further down a dimly lit hallway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If there’s one location that has not only taken this step but also a mile’s worth of them, it would be the Spencer Mansion from the 2002 remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with its 1996 counterpart, the mansion prides itself on featuring winding and twisting corridors full of locked doors and shambling zombies looking for their next meal. While the blend of (relatively) quiet rooms and enemy-infested areas remains accounted for in the remake, Capcom saw to it that things would be different where enemy behavior was concerned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the delayed appearance of the window-shattering Cerberus dogs and the introduction of nimble and claw-sporting Crimson Heads, the tweaks made to the classic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">formula ensure that returning players and newcomers alike will always have their composure shattered just as they are about to get settled into the routine of unlocking doors, solving puzzles, and acquiring progress-enabling items. It also doesn’t help that the bouts of terror gamers are bound to experience are amplified by the limited saves they can make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the Spencer Mansion succeeds in making each trip outside safe rooms a game of Russian Roulette: What are the chances that steady but tense exploration is interrupted by a threat players are unprepared for? What items are they to carry prior to venturing outside or in a specific part of the mansion? In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, respite is as rare as an ink ribbon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Make them a challenge to navigate and make sense of"><span>Make them a challenge to navigate and make sense of</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, virtual horrors need more than just scary aesthetics and unpredictable patterns to haunt players in the long term. There’s also the fact that the avatar shouldn’t be able to easily outrun or size up whatever they’ve gotten themselves into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More specifically, horror environments should make players feel like a lab rat stuck in a maze they can’t swiftly get out of—a maze with walls and floors that seem to literally and figuratively shift at every turn. While this principle can easily apply to making the levels themselves prone to sudden and unexpected variations in their layouts and contents, it can also pertain to audiovisual tricks and narrative touches that render story details ambiguous and/or unreliable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever the means, the end goal in that respect should be to make the horror setting something that defies human understanding and treats its visitors the same way a cat toys with its prey to weaken it prior to delivering the finishing blow. This should be the case regardless of how good gamers get at managing resources and exercising caution every step of the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One horror setting that never seems to let up on that front is STEM from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Evil Within </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">titles (2014 – 2017). Essentially a perfect mechanism for generating all sorts of horrific imagery via a machine-enabled mental world made up of different human minds, STEM is as fluid and messy as the human psyche.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t helped by the fact that mad folks can call the shots and hijack the system to carry out their devilish plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether it’s a decaying metropolis full of masked husks for human beings or a bunch of floating hallways monitored by a giant blue eye that doubles as a camera, each location in STEM operates and differs from one another without rhyme or reason. This adds to the feeling of helplessness that the lead character and innocent bystanders embody as they try to piece out the full story behind STEM and its malicious creator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps STEM’s defining and most disturbing characteristic is its ability to shift the environment at a moment’s notice—causing the avatar and nearby NPCs to fall down a hallway-turned-hole and watch as enemies spawn in a way that can only be described as paranormal. That everything is the byproduct of a troubled mind or two further drives home the idea that horrors can fundamentally be a reflection of people’s twisted perception of their world and woes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Add variety to levels and their contents to surprise players"><span>Add variety to levels and their contents to surprise players</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror settings depend on their being unpredictable to ensure that players can’t get used to exploring spooky-looking/-sounding locales. Related to offering bouts of terror and hard-to-understand realities is the need to shake things up a bit in terms of level design and content, the result being that each area surprises players regardless of how far they are into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be it through a thematic change, different gameplay style, and/or unforeseen series of narrative beats, areas within a horror setting can benefit from all manner of tweaks to the formula established throughout the player’s journey into the heart of darkness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While care must be taken to ensure that everything still feels like it belongs alongside the rest of the experience, developers needn’t shy away from a chance to upend player expectations if it means making the adventure more memorable and adding another beneficial gameplay and/or narrative layer to the proceedings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides, horror doesn’t have to rely just on blood and (exposed) guts to remind players of their being in an abnormal place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is something that’s on full display as players make their way deeper into the eponymous amusement park of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2001). As its purpose suggests, the setting proves itself highly conducive to providing the environmental equivalent of a buffet—keeping the player’s proverbial taste buds from growing numb to the same ol’ taste and texture of whatever they’re hoovering up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the graveyard that players explore upon entering the amusement park to the toy department that harbors innocent-looking playthings that can double as traps for unsuspecting observers, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s cornucopia of attractions and dangers maintains a delicate balance between meeting survival horror players’ expectations and presenting its own take on genre tropes out of left field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fancy a fight with live meat slabs and poultry on an oversized grill? How about taking on the role of a Woody knock-off and having to go to hell and fight not-Sonic the Hedgehog to rescue your loved one? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn’t afraid (heh) to skew toward the weird and surreal if it means making players look forward to—or dread—whatever’s coming next in the following stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The outcome is a horror-coaster ride that delivers copious amounts of blood, scares, and even laughs to offset the grim and prevent things from becoming so depressing that players grow numb to the title’s attempts at unsettling them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Provide them with some backstory contextualizing their state"><span>Provide them with some backstory contextualizing their state</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with other video game locales, a believable horror setting must have its reason(s) for being the way it is and/or bearing the stuff players will come across. Besides, it’s only natural for people to wish that they could make sense of creepy surroundings and figure out how best to navigate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This doesn’t necessarily mean explaining the odd phenomena impacting said setting—for that would make the unknown less terrifying—but lore can paint a picture of a world larger than what gamers will be able to see. This can paradoxically result in them </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>wanting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to search every dark (and dangerous) area they can find, even if a part of them wants to get out of Dodge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Backstory, however, can be more than just flavor text that doubles down on the tension permeating the experience. It can also provide players with ideas of where to look for clues and items that may help them make further progress in the game, making such narrative elements similarly relevant to those wishing to focus on the gameplay side of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is an area in which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2024) excels, its titular theme park housing all sorts of baneful attractions and often funny notes that shine a light on how things used to be and what players can do to make it out alive and sane.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the set of instructions on how to get a treasure chest to open in a nautical-themed restaurant and the series of messages hinting at shady mining operations in which the park’s owner is implicated, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s collectible notes help shine a light on why and how a seemingly innocuous amusement park went the way of the dodo not long ago. The lean writing ensures that players will get just the right amount of information and context to be compelled to collect more texts, even if it means having to venture into rooms full of traps and monsters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What’s impressive about SFB Games’ efforts is that the title’s narrative bits and pieces maintain a balance between storytelling and gameplay considerations, providing all players with at least one incentive to bother looking for notes. This, in turn, helps drive the exploration-combat-puzzle loop emblematic of the survival horror genre—satisfying players’ innate desire to explore every virtual nook and cranny and balancing that out with terrifying obstacles that add a risk-reward element to their endeavors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the presence and placement of texts—hardly exciting on their own—contribute to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s success in feeling as thrilling (or scary) as riding a roller coaster.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-good-within-designing-a-memorable-horror-game-protagonist">previous article</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on horror protagonists, tension doesn’t just arise from a setting looking and sounding like something wholly alien. Such a feeling can also be amplified by the player character’s realization that they might have more in common with their harrowing surroundings than they’d care to admit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror settings are more than just spooky virtual spaces players venture into at their own peril. They can also be reflections of the woes its inhabitants and visitors embody, adding a personal element to the environment’s monstrosities and ghastly happenings that can render even the sturdiest of souls mad. And if the player character’s one that gamers would love to know more about, then they’ll be tempted to wend their way into the darkest reaches of the setting—and potentially learn things about their character that recontextualize the narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ergo, the simple inclusion of a bond between the setting and the player character can add another layer to the narrative and compel players to find everything they can about their avatar—allowing the horrors on display to be more than skin-deep in terms of how greatly they can wound the player character.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2001) is an excellent example of a title sporting a setting that aims to put the player character through the wringer and have them learn something invaluable (about themselves) via the horrors they’re to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As James Sunderland, players will make their way through the eponymous resort town to look for their character’s wife. As they do so, they shall come across all kinds of monsters and locales whose scariest trait isn’t their baleful looks, but rather their sheer variety and potent ties to James’s personal struggles as a husband and human being.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From highly suggestive nurses roaming hospital hallways to pyramid-headed executioners looking for their next victim to impale, Silent Hill’s many supernatural denizens carry heavy-hitting symbolism that cuts more deeply into James than the rusty weapons they happen to be wielding. This ensures that the scars James leaves with aren’t the kind people can necessarily see, but rather the sort that time may not be able to fully heal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result is a setting that can have horrors lie not just around the player character, but also seep into them as their psyche starts to crack under the pressure of being stalked by unknown forces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let me know what you think of my post in the comments section, and feel free to ask questions and share the article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitter:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Watfen64">https://twitter.com/Watfen64</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Email:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#74191d171c11180715161615131c464444473419071a5a171b19"><span data-cfemail="bfd2d6dcd7dad3ccdeddddded8d78d8f8f8cffd2ccd191dcd0d2">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LinkedIn:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabbaghmichel/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabbaghmichel/</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces Interactive’s <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/">website</a> now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces Interactive released over ten titles on PC, Console and Mobile since 2007, both our own concepts such as Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice, Leviathan Warships, Robo Surf and Kill to Collect, as well as work for hire titles such as Magicka 2 and several DLCs for Magicka. Our client list includes Paradox Interactive, Koei Tecmo, Arrowhead Game Studios, Koch Media and RaceRoom Entertainment.</p>

<p>In 2017, Pieces Interactive were acquired by Embracer Group after working with the expansion for Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Ragnarök and third expansion for Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Atlantis.</p>

<p>Our last release was the reimagening of Alone in the Dark.</p>

<p>Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/29/embracer-group-cancels-new-deus-ex-game-in-development-at-eidos-montreal-lays-off">Eidos-Montreal</a>), selling off its studios (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/15/embracer-reportedly-set-to-sell-star-wars-kotor-remake-dev-saber-interactive-in-500">Saber Interactive</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/28/take-two-purchases-gearbox-entertainment-from-embracer-for-460-million">Gearbox Entertainment</a>), and outright closing others (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/embracer-reportedly-might-close-free-radical-design-its-reformed-timesplitters-team">Free Radical Design</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-developer-volition-games-has-been-shut-down">Volition Games</a>).

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You would think any company that let go employees might be struggling a bit financially. That’s not the case with EA. In fact, the publisher’s 2024 fiscal year appears to have been very lucrative since it made over $7 billion in net revenue, with CEO Andrew Wilson himself earning more than $25.6 million.</p> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>, EA revealed this in a recent <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Proxy Statement</a> for its shareholders. Said statement also broke down how much each of EA’s executives earned in terms of base salaries and bonuses. Altogether, these executives, including Wilson, made over $60 million. This past February, EA had opted to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/electronic-arts-announces-its-laying-off-5-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lay off 5% of its total workforce</a> (estimated to be about 670 people), with the only explanation being that it was a result of the company’s decision to move away from developing games based on licensed IPs (although it still has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/eas-iron-man-and-black-panther-games-to-be-open-world-according-to-job-listings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Marvel games based on Iron Man and Black Panther</a> in the works).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The full statement doesn’t appear to make any mention of the layoffs, though one of Wilson’s listed achievements is that he “oversaw a year of continued employee satisfaction scores above industry benchmarks, with record high talent retention and strong talent attraction.” Additional comments from Wilson himself only highlight how strong EA’s fiscal year has been.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">“Our teams are the best in the business, delivering awesome gameplay, innovation, and unmatched authenticity,” wrote Wilson. “We’re proud of our performance in service of our stockholders, employees, players, and communities. Our business remains strong, and I could not be more excited about our future as we bring more amazing games and experiences to more people around the world.”</p>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">EA is by no means the only company to have laid off staff. However, there has been a shocking loss of talent within the industry. In the past six months, there have been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more layoffs than in all of 2023</a>, which comes in stark contrast to reports like this that talk about how well things are going. </p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="false">In an executive summary, EA wrote, “During fiscal year 2024, we continued to deliver award-winning games and services to our players and generated strong financial and operating results. Hundreds of millions of players around the world came together and connected through our games, live services and content. We continued our efforts to value diverse teams and to create a healthy, inclusive culture that helps our people do their best work.”</p>

            <p>Recent data states Rockstar's GTA trilogy has hit a combined total of over 30m downloads on Netflix.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-heading-to-netflix-in-december">made their way onto the service in December</a>, following earlier reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-reportedly-looking-to-license-gta-title-as-it-moves-into-higher-end-gaming">Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar</a> to licence a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce "higher-end" titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue.</p>
<p>In January, it was subsequently reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-monthly-game-downloads-nearly-tripled-to-28m-in-december-thanks-to-gta">arrival of these three games had given a boost to Netflix's gaming endeavours</a>, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in the December. 18m of these downloads were a combination of San Andreas, Vice City, and GTA 3.</p>

<p>Rockstar's GTA series remains one of the most prominent in the industry today. Back in May, it was announced the studio's seemingly evergreen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies</a>. Meanwhile, when Rockstar revealed its first trailer for GTA 6 towards the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">quickly broke YouTube records</a>, becoming the most viewed video in 24 hours (that wasn't a music video), hitting an astonishing 90m in its first day.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to release on consoles during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">autumn next year</a> - a launch window <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">publisher Take-Two has said it is "highly confident" in</a>.</p>
<p>I do wonder whatever happened to that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-staying-quiet-on-status-of-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-vr">GTA San Andreas VR port</a> that was announced ages ago...?</p>

            <p>
Fumes has starred in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fumes">a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups</a> but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.</p>
<p>It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not <em>entirely</em> convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
At the very least, you can watch the latest trailer, below, though I must caution you that it was made for the PC Gaming Show and contains PCGamer branding. Don't worry: there are representations of rocks and shotguns in the footage, too, and some of those bits of flying detritus are likely pieces of paper. Thanks for the promotion, FUMES team!

As described on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920430/FUMES/">Steam page</a>, Fumes "is a single-player game inspired by the golden era of vehicular combat genre. Straight-forward, fast paced, intense gameplay. Get into the car, slap some weapons on and cruise twisted wastes." Don't mind if I do. There's an upgrades treadmill and customisation element in the shape of a mobile chop shop, but it doesn't feel like a game where you've got to add 5% to your spiked fender every 10 minutes to survive. Missions consist of racing or massacring the other drivers that throng the wilderness, delivering packages and wrecking bosses, some of which are large enough I'd love to board them using a jump ramp and play Fumes like a post-apocalyptic rodeo machine.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure if Fumes has a story beyond the timeless Dostoevskian tale of cars killing cars for parts, but it has a storied landscape. Travel far enough in a direction and you'll encounter beached tankers (some of which have monster tyres), skeletal oil rigs and some surprisingly green and flourishing swathes of forestland. I'm not trying to portray this as a meticulous piece of found storytelling, but there are hints of a pre-apocalyptic past to occupy the voyager when you aren't busy murdering icecream vans. Anyway, they're saying it'll be in early access for roughly a year, with the current build offering "all core features and a few hours of gameplay".</p>
<p>In other news, I've just checked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_combat_game">Wikipedia page for "vehicular combat game"</a> and they're saying it's a dead genre. Iunno what to think of that, but it's certainly been a while since the last Destruction Derby.</p>

And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, or now<em> Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h3620"><a id=""></a>A new <em>Fallout </em>might not happen anytime soon</h2><p>That’ll be bad news for anyone who was hoping Bethesda might pivot to getting the next <em>Fallout </em>game out sooner in the wake of the<em> Fallout</em> TV show’s wild success and breakout popularity beyond the existing fan base. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762"><em>Fallout 5</em></a></span>, or whatever the studio decides to call it, is currently slated to go into production after<em> The Elder Scrolls VI </em>is complete, which is likely still many years away as well at this point. </p><p>The recent boost in popularity, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302"><em>Fallout 4</em>'s next-gen update</a></span> making it one of April’s most-downloaded games, renewed speculation about whether Bethesda would be willing to hand-off the franchise to a third-party again, like it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601">did with Obsidian Entertainment for <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. Given that the studio is now part of Microsoft, there’s a lot of other internal teams it could partner with to potentially put out a smaller spin-off based in that world in the short-term.</p><p>But nothing Howard said in the interview suggested that’s currently one of Bethesda’s goals for the franchise. It doesn’t sound like remasters of <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> are on the table either. The CRPGs developed by Interplay Entertainment before Bethesda purchased the license are isometric and more punishing. They’re great but much harder to get into in the year 2024. </p><figure id="" data-id="de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-recommend-id="image://de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut approaches their ship.

He didn’t directly address rumors of <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remasters, so it’s unclear if the studio would feel similarly about modernizing them.<br></p><p>Instead, the director talked about how the team is trying to support existing games for longer. We’ve obviously seen that with <em>Fallout 76</em>, which is now in its sixth year, in the best shape it’s ever been, and is gaining players rather than losing them. Even though<em> Starfield</em> is a single-player game, it sounds like Bethesda might be taking a longer view with its offline RPGs moving forward as well. </p><h2 id="h3621"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield </em>could be supported for years to come</h2><p>For example, Howard said he’d wished the team had supported <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim</em> for longer given how long it kept selling and being widely-played for. Starfield is currently set to get its first expansion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space</em></a></span>, later this year, but it won’t be the only one. “We’re planning for the one after this, so there will be another one,” he confirmed in the interview. </p><p>It also sounds like the currently announced DLC will address some of the bigger criticisms of the base game, namely how empty, scattered, and repetitive it began to feel due in part to its procedurally generated worlds. <em>Shattered Space</em>, on the other hand, sounds pretty hand-crafted, focusing on a particular city and questline.</p><p> “Content wise, we’re looking at what we did with <em>Far Harbor</em> on<em> Fallout 4,” </em>Howard told MrMattyPlays. “This is a scope that works for our development in doing this annual story expansion type of thing. So really excited about that, and it lets us do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it’s still<em> Starfield</em>, but this new kind of alien world that you’re able to explore and it takes place there.”</p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>still doesn’t have a release date beyond fall 2024, but the expansion looked great when shown during Microsoft’s recent Xbox showcase. It might be exactly what the sci-fi RPG needs to win more people over. The DLC will also be available on Game Pass once it’s out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Ahead of the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, we're taking a look back at the company's history of June and E3-centric events.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Though the industry has since moved on from E3, it was once the most consequential event of the year for video games. Long before publishers could disseminate news through social media channels and live streams, they traditionally reserved their biggest announcements and reveals for the expo, making it the stage for some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remembering-e3s-biggest-and-best-moments-and-annou/1100-6474770/">most memorable moments in gaming history</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Among these is Nintendo’s E3 2004 press conference, a presentation that’s remembered fondly for introducing some notable games--and faces--to the gaming public. Given Nintendo’s precarious standing in the industry at the time, this particular E3 was a crucial moment for the company, a chance to dispel the gloom surrounding GameCube’s lagging sales and reaffirm that Nintendo still had what it took to compete in the increasingly crowded home console market. Not only did the presentation ultimately exceed fan expectations, it in many ways signaled the start of a new era for the company.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time E3 2004 rolled around, Nintendo was at a critical juncture. Two years into Satoru Iwata’s tenure as president, the company’s prospects seemed bleak. For all the strides Iwata had made in repairing relations with third parties, the GameCube continued to struggle in the face of stiff competition from the unstoppable PS2 and Microsoft’s Xbox, while the once-uncontested Game Boy Advance was about to face its most formidable challenger yet in Sony’s newly announced PSP.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, the company was coming off of a disappointing showing at the previous year’s expo. Nintendo spent an inordinate amount of its E3 2003 press conference demonstrating GameCube-Game Boy Advance connectivity--a novel concept that birthed some genuinely creative gaming experiences in Pac-Man Vs. and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but one that hardly ignited much interest among hardcore gamers or spurred console sales. Coupled with the lack of any truly major announcements, the presentation underwhelmed fans and did little to assuage worries about the GameCube’s future.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, a lot was riding on Nintendo’s E3 2004 showcase--and it would end up marking a pivotal turning point for the company. The press conference kicked off with the public debut of Nintendo’s new executive vice president of sales and marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime, who in fairly short order would go on to become president of Nintendo of America and the face of the company’s Western operations for the next 15 years (not to mention inspire a treasure trove of memes). Reggie opened the presentation with a decidedly un-Nintendo introduction: “My name is Reggie. I’m about kicking ass, I’m about taking names, and we’re about making games.”</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gY8iJ4DWw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/59gY8iJ4DWw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo wasted little time illustrating that final point, immediately showcasing three hotly anticipated titles coming to the GameCube in the near future: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Star Fox Assault, and Capcom’s Resident Evil 4. The tone of the conference was a stark contrast to the previous year’s. Nintendo made a conscious effort to repair its image among core gamers and spent the opening moments of the presentation highlighting a slate of mature games aimed squarely at ardent fans. Though it wasn’t enough to ultimately reverse the GameCube’s fortunes, Metroid Prime 2 and Resident Evil 4 would both go on to earn critical and commercial acclaim, while Star Fox Assault would gain a cult following for its willingness to experiment with the series’ formula.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time it was courting hardcore gamers, Nintendo also began paving the way into a wider market. Later in the conference, Iwata took the stage to reveal Nintendo’s implicit response to the PSP: the Nintendo DS, an unorthodox dual-screen handheld that featured a touch screen, microphone, and wireless communication. Though initially positioned as a “third pillar” intended to coexist alongside the Game Boy line, the DS was a bold gambit--one that bemused press at the time and served as a test dive into the “blue ocean” strategy Nintendo would fully embrace with its next home console. With the DS, Nintendo was deliberately opting out of the technological arms race that fueled the video game industry. Though the handheld was a marked step up from the Game Boy Advance, it did not strive to compete with the PSP directly in terms of sheer horsepower. Rather, Nintendo traded cutting-edge tech for a number of unique input methods, opening up different forms of interactivity and, in turn, original gameplay experiences not possible on other devices.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time, the gaming media wasn’t quite sure what to make of the DS. Many interpreted it as a nervous Hail Mary, cobbled together quickly in an attempt to stave off the assuredly dominant PSP. As history would prove, however, Nintendo’s gamble was a wise one. Though the DS launched with several traditional games, including a packed-in demo of Metroid Prime Hunters, the device quickly found an audience beyond regular gamers thanks to its approachable interface. Even those who had never played a video game before could easily intuit how to operate the system’s touch screen, which in turn gave rise to a variety of non-traditional games like Nintendogs and Brain Age. Both titles would go on to sell multiple millions of copies, reaching far beyond the traditional gaming market and propelling DS to becoming one of the best-selling systems in history.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320056" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320056"></a><figcaption>Originally boasting a bulky and unconventional design, the Nintendo DS confused and intrigued gamers when it was officially unveiled at E3 2004.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most exciting announcement, however, was yet to come. Following the DS demonstration, Reggie returned to the stage and closed out the presentation by inviting viewers to “step inside one more world” for GameCube. The ensuing trailer slowly panned through a series of realistic fantasy environments, each scene building intrigue and anticipation over what this new mystery title could be. Just as Link rode into focus astride Epona and it became clear that a new Legend of Zelda game was in the works, the audience erupted in cheers, punctuating what was already an exciting press conference with one of the loudest ovations in E3 history.</p><p dir="ltr">The as-yet untitled Zelda game would eventually become Twilight Princess, and its darker, more realistic art style was a clear response to the divisive reaction that greeted Wind Waker and its sunny, cartoonish visuals several years earlier. It was yet further indication that the notoriously obstinate Nintendo was willing to course correct and cater to longtime fans when warranted. Twilight Princess wouldn’t launch for another two years, and while it would still serve as GameCube’s swansong, it would also usher in Nintendo’s next home console, the Wii--another unusual strategy that paid off for the company. Twilight Princess helped propel Wii sales and would go on to move more than eight million copies, making it the best-selling console home installment in the series--a designation it would hold on to for more than a decade until it was eventually overtaken by Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">This eventual success is further proof that E3 2004 was a pivotal moment in Nintendo’s history. After years of struggling to remain relevant in the industry it had helped shape, Nintendo used its press conference to lay the groundwork for a more promising path forward for the company, one that set it up for even greater success than its glory days in the ‘80s and early ‘90s.</p>

                <p>CI Games has announced that a sequel to Lords of the Fallen is currently in development, and it most likely will not be sold on Steam for its PC release.</p><p>CI Games <a href="https://cigames.com/en/ci-games-se-28-2024-signing-of-binding-term-sheet-with-epic-games-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Epic Games has the exclusive distribution rights for the Lords of the Fallen sequel on PC for its entire product life cycle. However, the IP rights and publishing rights for other platforms, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, remain with CI Games. The studio mentions that the game is due out in 2026 as well. The announcement refers to it as a sequel to Lords of the Fallen, so it may not actually be called "Lords of the Fallen 2."</p><p>It's unclear if Epic is funding the game's development similar to how it did for Remedy's Alan Wake 2. It's currently an Epic Games Store exclusive and so far shows no signs of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-alan-wake-2-isnt-on-steam/1100-6518717/" data-ref-id="1100-6518717">leaving the PC storefront for Steam</a>. Even if Epic isn't funding Lords of the Fallen 2's development, its publishing rights on PC suggest the game will follow the same route and be exclusive to the Epic Games Store.</p><p>Lords of the Fallen is a reboot of the 2014 game with the same name, both of which are heavily inspired by the Souls-like subgenre. One of Lords of the Fallen's unique mechanics is the Umbral Lamp, which lets players switch between the realms of the dead and the living, which opens up new pathways to progress.</p><p>It was released in October 2023 for PC on both Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lords-of-the-fallen-review-dark-slog/1900-6418133/" data-ref-id="1900-6418133">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, we said, "While Lords of the Fallen has all the right Souls-like elements, its disjointed pacing and painful checkpoint system make much of the game a slow and frustrating march."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inside-the-making-of-astro-bot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>During Summer Games Fest last week, I frequently asked our friends in the games media what they've seen or played that's impressed them. We don't get to play as much as we'd like at <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, and so it's useful intel to hear what the journalists think.</p>
<p>In almost every conversation, one game would come up again and again: Astro Bot.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that was one we did play. The 3D platformer is the follow-up to Astro's Playroom, a small game that's included with every PS5 and showcases the capabilities of the console's DualSense controller. The quality of Astro's Playroom prompted Sony to invest in the developer behind it, Team Asobi, and now they're building a full follow-up, which launches this September.</p>
<p>When we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team-asobi-we-want-our-games-to-feel-like-theyre-made-in-japan">first caught up with Team Asobi back in 2022</a>, it shared with us how the studio operated. There is a core team working on Astro Bot, with a smaller group prototyping new ideas outside of the game.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/img_DL93Djd.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Nicolas Doucet, Team Asobi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"They are not bound to platforming," explains studio and creative director Nicolas Doucet. "That was on purpose so they don't feel limited. Otherwise, your brain puts in all sorts of restrictions."</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Asobit was around 60 employees, with Doucet expecting it to grow to 100. Instead, they've just added "a handful more" in the two years since.</p>
<p>"We've kept it quite tight," he says. "Even though this game is obviously bigger, it really comes down to people knowing the game well. It's a good size."</p>
<p>During our previous interview, we touched upon the way Asobi makes its games. They come up with a wealth of ideas, assigns people to them, then gets everyone together after two weeks to showcase, play and review the work.</p>
<p>"We do that right until the end," Doucet tells us. "Now we are in the final, final phase in the game, we replay so much everyday that it's less of a necessity. But it's really needed as we're finding our way. It means everybody keeps track of where we are, but also has a chance to showcase two weeks of work and see people's reaction. A lot of what we do are bite-sized moments of humour and maybe interactive objects, like a toy. They don't take time to make, it's just a large amount of individual pieces. [These check-ins] means you can check you're on the right track, and you're also spotlighting your own work, which can be a powerful motivation."</p>
<p>These meetings feature all 60 employees and last about two and a half hours. An artist might be showcasing several 3D models, or several pages of storyboarding, while an animator goes through multiple animations.</p>
<p>"For a programmer, it might be a prototype," Doucet continues. "It wouldn't be inside the game directly yet, but it would be in a little room that they built for themselves. So in the [Summer Game Fest gameplay demo], you have that bit where the bulldog is on your back and smashes through things. Well in two weeks, a programmer might have the first prototype of that. It won't be a bulldog, probably just a rocket. The idea is to make the gameplay feel good and you can go around this white room and smash things."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-17-093008.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The rocket bulldog from Astro Bot would have started life as a prototype built in two weeks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After these meetings, the team gives their opinions and decisions are made over what to do next.</p>
<p>"Usually it's quite obvious when something is going well. You can gauge it from the reaction of the team. I watch people a lot, because when you're talking about humour, sometimes we have different sensitivities to something that might be funny. And if you see people finding something funny… I tend to put my own feelings aside. It's just one person's view. If the whole group is having a moment where they feel something is really great, that's a good gauge.</p>
<p>"And for things that don’t go well… at the end of the review, everybody gets to say one thing they enjoyed, and one thing that should be improved. And that usually highlights trends towards what is popular and what isn't, and out of that we take actions for the next two weeks."</p>
<p>My mind immediately went to what happens when something someone has spent weeks or months building ends up not impressing the team and cut from the game.</p>
<p>"There are features in the game, even entire levels, which take a good amount of time, several weeks, and we are like: 'You know what, it feels like a double of that other level. And to finish it will be a big investment, and the return on that investment for the player is almost zero, so let's not do it'," Doucet admits.</p>
<blockquote><p>"With the adaptive triggers and haptics, we really went to town"</p></blockquote>
<p>"Of course, when having those conversations we need to be polite and respectful. But fundamentally, everyone understands that it always come from the players' benefit point-of-view. When you have your level canned, you might go home feeling not so good, but the next day, you'll always be working on something that interests you. As long as we can keep that going, I think it's fine. Putting ego to the side in general, and this is valid for everyone, is probably the best way to have a sane positive mindset.</p>
<p>"Also, there is always the prospect that you're cutting something that could be reused in the DLC or a sequel. There is always that hope."</p>
<p>Indeed, Asobi is meticulous when it comes to archiving all of the ideas that end up not making it into the game.</p>
<p>"Our ability to archive is really important," Doucet says. "In the first year of a project like this, you do a lot of tests. Second year, you really build the game with all the tests that you did. And then the third year you are polishing everything. Roughly speaking that is how it goes. That means, by the time we finish, the exploration part was a long time ago. And there is a risk that we will forget a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>"Also, some of these ideas are running on old versions of the game, which we cannot run anymore. So being able to go back and have this archive of good ideas, it is something we realised is really important. Otherwise, you end up re-inventing the wheel, or worse, forgetting about an amazing idea that we had that didn't fit for X or Y reason.</p>
<p>"It could just be confidence at that time. Or maybe there was just more interest elsewhere. And if your expectations drop a bit, you might allow something that you previously rejected back into your thinking, and from that you get a genius idea."</p>
<p>This is the development process that has led to the demo we played in LA last week, which was crammed full of ideas, and with gameplay that feels as good as the very best platformers.</p>
<p>Yet for all the inevitable comparisons to Nintendo's platform games, this is distinctly a PlayStation title. On a superficial level, the game is filled with PlayStation iconography and characters. This is one thing that has been brought across from Astro's Playroom, and Doucet admitted there was some reservations around doing the same thing again.</p>
<p>"We thought… if we lean too much into PlayStation, are we not allowing Astro be its own thing? Will we know if he can stand on his own feet? So the first thing was to prototype all these ideas in the Astro world only. But then we realised, if you're a fan of PlayStation and Astro's Playroom, which had all these things in it, and then the next game didn't… I'd be disappointed, honestly."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-17-093041.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Astro Bot is once again filled with PlayStation iconography</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So the team decided to do it again, but this time they went further, with over 150 characters, including Astro versions of Kratos (God of War), Drake (Uncharted) and Aloy (Horizon), to find and collect.</p>
<p>"It is a bit of a geek dream," Doucet says. "They're not just characters, they have meaning and are very close to our hearts. When you grow up with a game, it's not just a game, it was part of your life, which means there is an emotional attachment. So hopefully everyone will find their favourite ones."</p>
<p>The characters aren't named, but their designs and descriptions – written by Dan Meher – should prove enough to work out who they are. The game does poke fun at the characters, as is the nature of Astro Bot's humour, and Doucet says that the other PlayStation studios were very receptive to this presentation of their IP.</p>
<p>"There is a place where you can collect these characters, a museum, and you can punch them to get a funny reaction," Doucet says. "And those reactions really go deep into the things they did in their games. So we are always trying to be very respectful, but also taking the piss and being funny with those IPs.</p>
<p>"The other studios have really embraced it. There hasn't been anything difficult. A lot of these IPs have quite dramatic stories with deep characters. And we're making them funny, so Kratos gets angry, but it's kind of cute angry. And there has been a real acceptance to that. I was thinking this was going to be really complicated and administration heavy. But it was really smooth sailing."</p>
<blockquote><p>"There are so many things that are bound to the essence of PlayStation with this game, that it is difficult to imagine it elsewhere"</p></blockquote>
<p>The other element that makes this distinctly a PlayStation game is how Astro Bot, like with Playroom, leans heavily on the features of the DualSense controller. Doucet says they've gone further this time and highlights the sponge concept as an example.</p>
<p>"That idea came from these isolated demos we were doing outside of Astro," he explains. "We were looking at the kind of expression we can do with the adaptive trigger, and we came up with a sponge made of water, and when you squeeze the water out, it then becomes light. You can program the trigger to have more or less resistant. We did this prototype, which was just a sponge on the screen you could squeeze, and it felt really good, so that informed a part of Astro.</p>
<p>"There is also another feature in the game called 'feel the wall'. You can see a gold wall and Astro can run his hands against it, and you can feel the change of texture in the DualSense as he goes from smooth to rough and then smooth again. Then you go back to the rough part, push it, and it's a secret passage. It's something kind of magical. You've seen it before with things like Indiana Jones. It could be done with normal vibration, but it would be a bit mundane, and with the DualSense you can really feel the smooth and rough."</p>
<p>However, there are some parts of the controller the team has scaled back on compared with Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>"With Astro's Playroom being a tech demo, we wanted to use every feature [of the controller]. So you'd have the platforming, then it would go to a minigame, then back to platforming. It was separated," Doucet says. "But this time, it is all blended together. All the new [powers] support the fundamental jumping around. That means we are doing less with the touchpad, because using the touchpad means your fingers are coming off the jump button and it becomes a clunky way to play. But with the adaptive triggers and haptics, we really went to town."</p>
<p>And indeed, it was this that seemed to excite many of the journalists we spoke to in Los Angeles. In an era where most games, even first-party games, have been built so that they can be played across all sorts of devices – mobile, consoles and PC – it's exciting to find something that has been very purposefully created for one platform.</p>
<p>Doucet concludes: "Very often we have this conversation. There are so many things that are bound to the essence of PlayStation with this game, that it is difficult to imagine it elsewhere. It is really built for PlayStation."</p>

<p data-characters="382" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anime has been a huge focal point of my life since a very young age, cheering on Gohan to defeat Cell in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and Yugi to win the Battle City Tournament in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> However, one genre of anime always disinterested me and that was sports. No sports anime ever caught my attention for very long, with the exception of <em>Yuri on Ice!!</em>, rest in peace. That is, until <em>Blue Lock</em>. </p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">I certainly tried my fair share of sports anime throughout the years, including the fan-favorites like <em>Haikyuu!</em> and <em>Free</em>. Outside of the super catchy musical openings and endings, I didn’t stick around for long. <em>Blue Lock</em>, however, immediately swept me off my feet and I recently binged the entire first season in a matter of two days. This is largely because of the excellent soccer matches, sure, but also the phenomenal way in which <em>Blue Lock</em> frames its storyline and characters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-squid-game-like-setting-works-wonders" data-injectable="false"><em>Squid Game</em>-like setting works wonders</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">A huge part of why <em>Blue Lock</em> gripped me in a way no other sports anime has comes down to the immediate premise, which feels like a battle royale or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/squid-game-season-2-release-window-on-netflix-trailer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game</a></em>-like competition. The goal of the titular Blue Lock competition is to find the best Japanese high school soccer players to craft a national team able to compete with the greats in the World Cup. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Each episode feels like a reality TV show in how the contestants compete in various challenges or soccer matches to whittle down the number of players from the initial 300 students all the way down to the handful of winners. This adds a level of intensity and heartbreak I haven’t seen in any other similar series. </p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Right off the bat, without going too deep into spoilers, the series eliminates one of the most promising potential villains from the Blue Lock competition without a care in the world. The series is absolutely brutal because of this, frequently removing important characters from the story in surprising and relentless ways without a moment’s notice. </p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">In the first season alone of <em>Blue Lock</em>, there are a couple of standout moments that rival the renowned sixth episode of <em>Squid Game</em>. This setup is so incredible; it feeds that one-more-episode drive, and it even won over sports anime haters like myself. </p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-selfish-protagonist-helps-to-differentiate" data-injectable="false">Selfish protagonist helps to differentiate</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">You can even feel the winner-takes-all mentality of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blue-lock-episode-nagi-movie-release-date-and-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blue Lock</em></a> series in its central protagonist, Yoichi Isagi. Isagi is by far one of the most selfish and inconsiderate “heroes” I’ve seen in an anime. He is in the competition only for himself, to prove that he is the number-one striker in all of Japan. Isagi’s personality is fascinatingly abrasive, to the point I didn’t even like him half the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="682" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">That might seem odd and like a negative, but I find a more complicated protagonist makes a series all the more intriguing and fun to watch. He reminds me of Lelouch from <em>Code Geass</em>, in a way. Isagi makes some questionable decisions, but I can’t stop watching. At times, Isagi is honestly a bit hard to root for when he betrays a teammate or makes himself the one to get the glory for a key goal, but this makes him all the more compelling to watch. Isagi feels more realistic than the typical overly optimistic anime protagonist. He is all about furthering his own career no matter who he has to push aside. Seeing how Isagi’s recklessness affects his relationships is enticing.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">This selfish idea applies to the supporting cast, too. They all have their own motivations and goals in the competition, most of which aren’t exactly altruistic or friendly. It feels refreshing to have a series where it isn’t all about the power of friendship or a happy-go-lucky storyline.</p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-stellar-action-and-drama-on-and-off-the-field" data-injectable="false">Stellar action and drama on and off the field</h2> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">If there is one part about <em>Blue Lock</em> you can bet your money on, it is how high the stakes are. It doesn’t matter if you are on the field or off it; everything is so dramatic. The action and drama are top notch from start to finish in the first season of the series, complete with detailed and gorgeous animation to match this. However, this isn’t necessarily unique to this particular series. Most sports anime at least have this part down, which is the genre is so popular. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">That said, I tried other soccer anime in the past, such as <em>Aoashi</em>. As a former high school soccer player myself, I can say these other series adapted the action quite well. Everything from dribbling, passing, shooting goals, and tackling look great. However, series like <em>Aoashi</em> felt just a little bit too safe and tame for my liking. <em>Blue Lock</em>, on the other hand, ensures every moment on the field is as over-the-top as it gets. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">There are plenty of twists, superpower moments, and going to the next level in the middle of the soccer matches. This makes the series almost feel like a nonstop iteration of the Tournament of Power from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-dragon-ball-super-season-2-actually-happening-speculation-and-rumors-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. But even when the story quiets down off the field, it still doesn’t hold back in the drama department. There are so many betrayals, back-stabbings, and surprises that keep the viewer on their toes in almost every single episode. </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">You could argue the series doesn’t take enough time to pause from the constant twists and turns. This is fair. It doesn’t slow down enough in some key moments. But if you want a show with breakneck pacing, look no further. I appreciated how it respects the viewer’s time. Filler isn’t a problem here. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="false">Overall, <em>Blue Lock</em> is the perfect anime for newcomers to sports anime to check out. It won this sports anime hater over due to its battle royale-like premise, stellar cast of morally gray and sometimes unlikable characters, and nonstop action and drama. This is the type of series you’ll want to start and not stop until it’s over.</p>

<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hey, remember that time <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/twitch-plays-pokemon-is-now-playing-pokemon-crystal/">Twitch played Pokémon</a>? An amusing endeavor, I’m sure many of you will agree. Well, what if we did the same thing but with another game. Say…<em>Doom</em>? Oh man, that would be pretty amusing to see and not at all complicated to actualize.</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Well, would you look at that. Someone’s only gone and done it. YouTuber ThePrimeagen has managed to make the original <em>Doom</em> capable of being played by simultaneous Twitch viewers; 1,000 of them, to be precise. Now, it should be said that this is technically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASCII</a> version of the classic FPS, but it still stands as an entertaining experiment.</p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="1000 People Play Doom At Once" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f9tbqSIm-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Needless to say, the above video contains <em>a lot</em> of complex information about how they were able to convert and compress the game in such a way as to make it playable via a chat log. I’m not even going to attempt to explain it, as the knowledge I have of programming and software engineering is on par with my expertise on hyperlocal economics in the region of – oh, I don’t know – the town of Shitterton in England (look it up).</p>
 <h2 id="h-it-s-real" data-injectable="false">It’s real</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">If you want to just see the part where 1,000 people play the opening section of <em>Doom</em>, you will need to pretty much skip to the last minute of the video. If you are genuinely fascinated by how it’s all achieved, I’ll see you in 15 minutes.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Right at the end, we get to see the final result of ThePrimeagen’s work, which involves tasking people in Twitch chat to control <em>Doom</em>. You all know how this work, which means you probably also know how this turns out.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">There are a large number of hiccups along the way, including Doom Guy continually falling down a staircase before he’s able to get up it. However, the effort is worth the wait, as the viewers do manage to complete the first level of <em>Doom</em>, tricky though it clearly was. Isn’t technology pretty cool?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CI Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>is due sometime in 2026, and not only that - it'll be an Epic Games Store exclusive when it launches on PC.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html#pvy7zfso61" rel="noopener" target="_blank">binding term sheet</a> signed between CI and Epic, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>sequel (which, according to past form, will probably also be called&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>) is targeting a 2026 release window.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like the game will be coming to Steam at all, either. The term agreement says that Epic has "exclusive worldwide distribution rights" on PC for "the entire product life cycle", so it looks like you won't be playing&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em>-slash-<em>3&nbsp;</em>on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-epic-lotf-screenshot.jpg?itok=qfpE_ySD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-epic-lotf-screenshot.jpg?itok=o626qguk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>appeared on Steam, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>won't.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will still be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though, and CI Games is retaining publishing rights, so&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>won't be published by Epic.</p>
<p>Since we're a long way out from 2026 at time of writing, a lot could change between now and the sequel's release, but if this agreement holds, then you might have to make the switch if you want to enjoy CI Games' followup to its 2023 Soulslike.</p>
<p>This is also the first concrete confirmation that CI Games'&nbsp;<em>Project 3</em>, which the studio has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ci-games-layoffs-lords-of-fallen">spoken about in the past</a>, is definitely a followup to&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>and not an action-RPG under the umbrella of a separate IP.</p>
<p><em>Project 3&nbsp;</em>isn't CI Games' only title in the pipeline, though; the studio is also working alongside internal outfit Underdog on&nbsp;<em>Project Survive</em>, although details are scant about that game right now.</p>

<p><em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike that tasks you with traveling the land of Mournstead in order to prevent the revival of the dark god Adyr. Along the way, you can expect tons of fallen knights to slaughter, as well as big bosses to take down and sprawling levels to explore.</p>

            <p>
EA's top execs earned $60m in the fiscal year 2024, despite the company laying off hundreds of employees.
</p>
<p>
In particular CEO Andrew Wilson earned just under half that number himself - $25.6m - and was praised for executing on "key strategic and operating objectives".
</p>
<p>
Those objectives include reorganising the business into EA Entertainment and EA Sports; "optimising our portfolio, investments and resources in support of our strategic priorities and growth initiatives" as part of a restructuring plan; progressing the company's "long-term strategy plan focused on driving durable growth, strong cash flow and stockholder returns"; and overseeing a "year of continued employee satisfaction scores above industry benchmarks", which included "record high talent retention".

<p>

These numbers come courtesy of an annual Proxy Statement, which details the compensation of EA's execs, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>.

</p>
<p>
Breaking it down, Wilson earned $1.3m from his basic salary, plus over $20m in stock awards, just under $3.5m from a non-equity incentive plan, and $500k in "other" compensation. This, in total, was around $5m more than in 2023 and 2022.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, technology and central development, earned a total of $12m, acknowledging her assumed leadership of EA Entertainment and overseeing the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launch, among other achievements.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile CFO Stuart Canfield earned a total of $6.5m, among others.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it's a stark indication of the amount of money earned at the top of the games industry.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, the median employee earned $148,704 in compensation, meaning Wilson earned 172 times more than the average EA employee.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">EA laid off five percent of its staff</a>, amounting to around 670 employees. Wilson said at the time the cuts were part of a continuing effort to "optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business".

</p>
<p>
These cuts followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-laying-off-6-of-its-workforce-as-part-of-restructuring">previous round of "restructuring" in March 2023</a>, which impacted six percent of the workforce (over 750 people).

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">Games industry layoffs have surpassed 10,000 for 2024 so far</a>, which is almost as many that were impacted in 2023 in less than half the time.

He comes in the Battle Pass for <em>MultiVersus</em>’ first season, which means returning Open Beta players get him off the bat, and if you’re spending money, he’s a more reasonable return for investment compared to Joker. So grab your machete, axe and bright yellow sleeping bags, folks; it’s spooky time.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="4f8f4caac3a5ab5bc9412797d6c121d2" data-recommend-id="image://4f8f4caac3a5ab5bc9412797d6c121d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Free Premium Pass screen in Multiversus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Free Premium Pass screen in Multiversus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4f8f4caac3a5ab5bc9412797d6c121d2" data-recommend-id="image://4f8f4caac3a5ab5bc9412797d6c121d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Free Premium Pass screen in Multiversus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h3454"><a id=""></a>How to unlock Jason in MultiVersus</h3><p>For now, Jason is an instant unlock if you buy the season one Battle Pass. If you played the Open Beta and are coming back while the season is active, you don’t even have to pay. Otherwise, you’ll need to wait until the season ends before you can grab Jason as a separate purchase with Gleamium or Fighter Currency. It’s probably safe to assume he’ll be priced the same as Joker, but that’s just a guess for now.</p><h3 id="h3455"><a id=""></a>Jason’s Move List</h3><p><strong>Passive</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Relentless:</strong> Jason isn’t affected by knockback when he has “Gray Health” activated.</li></ul><p><strong>Attacks</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Dash: <strong>Freight Train:</strong> Shoulder tackle dash attack - updated to block projectiles!</li><li>Neutral (Ground:) <strong>Axe Slam:</strong> Chargeable overhead slash that also moves Jason forward during the charge.</li><li>Neutral (Air): <strong>Scoop and Slice:</strong> A scoop, and a slice!</li><li>Side (Ground: <strong>Fear the 13th:</strong> Jason’s basic three-hit combo you’ll be hearing a lot about later.

He also packs a major punch, offering tons of damage per hit compared to the Iron Giant or even Superman. That’s given him the designation of “noob killer,” since getting points off less experienced players takes way less effort than with most other fighters. But the story changes once you get further up the food chain, as using Jason becomes a much more precise affair.<br></p><p>Jason doesn’t automatically have any armor properties, so you can’t just throw out big, meaty moves without fear of consequences. Instead, it’s better to wait for punishment opportunities, or toss out quick moves like his Forward Jab or Ground Up Special (No Escape) to go on the offensive and control screen space. Jason’s Air Neutral Scoop and Slice) or Air Down attack (6 Feet Under Or Go To Hell) are also solid approaching moves that can create combo opportunities.<br></p><p>Jabbing is the ideal, especially because once you confirm the hit you can do all kinds of stuff from there. The basic combo from repeating jab gives you a throw that overrides armor, but you can cancel into lots of other moves to create different scenarios for huge damage. You can get creative, but the easiest move is to use Up Attack (Crunch Time) after the second jab, which lets you create a route to Jason’s absurdly powerful up special.<br></p><p>If you really want to cook with gas, while Jason doesn’t have armor in his normal moveset, you can use his Ground Neutral Special (Unstoppable Rage) to activate his passive. You take some self-inflicted damage, but you get a temporary bump in damage for your next move alongside movement speed and “gray health.” While the gray health is active you don’t take knockback, giving you a chance to really chase someone down and make a huge damage trade in your favor. This is a risky play, but the reward can be enormous.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-recommend-id="image://fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-recommend-id="image://fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h3457"><a id=""></a>What Perks should Jason use?</h3><p>The signature Perk you want to use is Monstrous Sidestep, if you use any. This makes Jason’s Side Special (Mist Step) home in on the closest character, even teleporting behind them if he’s close enough. This helps close distance effectively, which is something Jason can’t do well otherwise. Well Rounded is fine if you want to eke out a little more damage and don’t find the Side Special as useful.<br></p><p>Beyond that, Protective Momentum is great for help against projectiles, another of Jason’s biggest weaknesses. Last Stand is an obvious choice for Tank-style play, while Pugilist is a no-brainer for a pure melee character.</p><h3 id="h3458"><a id=""></a>Okay sure, but is Jason good?</h3><p>Let’s close this out with some opinion work. Jason is super-fun to play, especially if you have love for classic horror movies. Not only is the design great and fitting for the <em>MultiVersus</em> style, but all the little nods to <em>Friday the 13th</em> and jokes in Jason’s moveset are on point. Swinging the classic murder weapons around, with so much weight powering the animations, feels great. The sleeping bag is a hilarious touch as well, and using it can really change the cadence of a match.<br></p><p>He’s definitely tough to use well, though. <em>MultiVersus</em> is a fast game with lots of projectiles, and charging into the fray head-on as Jason is an easy way to lose. Be especially careful about choosing your shots in 2v2, as Jason makes for an excellent punching bag between two players if your partner isn’t there to bail you out.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
