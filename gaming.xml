<p>Over 500 developers at Blizzard, making up the entire World of Warcraft team, have officially formed a union, it was announced on Wednesday. </p>



<p>The Communications Workers of America&nbsp;(CWA) <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced the formation</a> of the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild – CWA Union (WoWGG-CWA) with the Microsoft-owned organization. The new union includes all designers, engineers, producers, artists, quality assurance testers, and other game developers at Blizzard. It’s the “first wall-to-wall union at Activision Blizzard and the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p>



<p>“What we’ve accomplished at World of Warcraft is just the beginning,” Eric Lanham, Test Analyst and member of the WoWGG-CWA, said via release<em><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></em> “My colleagues and I are embarking on a quest to secure better pay, benefits, and job security through a strong union contract. We know that when workers have a protected voice, it’s a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience.”</p>



<p>With the formation of the WoWGG-CWA, over 1,750 workers a Microsoft-owned studios have unionized. Just last week it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers at Bethesda became the first</a> Microsoft studio to fully unionize.</p>



<p>“This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change,” Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, said. “Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry, from AAA studios like SEGA and Bethesda to indie developers.”</p>



<p>Activision-Blizzard has yet to publicly comment on the WoWGG-CWA formation.</p>

While some of the pictures highlight what appear to be early-in-development locations and gameplay modifiers, others are instantly recognizable.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/multiversus-blogroll-1716421095391.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Harry Potter and Barbie content may soon join the MultiVersus family.</figcaption></figure></output><p>One<a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815827879361487036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>notable example</u></a> shows a stage with broomsticks that hover above a platform decorated with four distinct colors: blue, red, green, and yellow. It doesn’t take a Harry Potter expert to recognize that the broomsticks could signal that the map is intended to be Quidditch-themed, but those banners also seem to be placeholders for the universe’s four houses, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. While no Harry Potter representative can be seen in the image, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the stage accompanied by someone like Dumbledore or Hermione should Harry Potter content ever make its official MultiVersus debut.</p><p>The datamine also reveals a stage that is unmistakably inspired by last year’s megaton movie hit, Barbie. The <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815821132651548714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-pink location</a> is dressed with palm trees, multiple levels to fight on, and a twisty slide that seems to lead to a pool. It looks almost exactly the same as star Margot Robbie’s Barbie Dreamhouse, though like the Harry Potter stage, it lacks any Barbie or Ken character representation.</p><p>Other MultiVersus datamine images show off heavily rumored characters like the <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780822080794744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls</a>, <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815780738706329909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DC’s Nubia</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV/status/1815781343889899559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure Time’s Marceline</a>, though until developer Player First Games has anything to announce, it’s best not to expect any of the content shown to officially appear in-game. It's at least clear that the developer has more plans behind the scenes, as Warner Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developers behind World of Warcraft, one of the world’s biggest and longest-running MMORPGs, have officially unionized.</p><p>Earlier today, an official vote of over 500 eligible employees working on World of Warcraft was tallied and certified. With this, Blizzard Entertainment has its first ever “wall-to-wall” union, encompassing the entirety of a game development team instead of just one division, like QA. The union includes designers, engineers, producers, artists, QA testers, and other developers, most of whom are based in either Irvine, CA, or are part of a smaller team in Massachusetts. The group is called World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild, or WoWGG, and is a part of Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>Additionally, a second group of Activision-Blizzard QA workers based in Austin, Texas have formed a separate union with Communications Workers of America, called Texas Blizzard QA United. The roughly 60 developers involved primarily work on Diablo, Hearthstone, and other games. Both unions concluded their votes today and have been officially recognized under Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement and certified by an independent arbitrator.</p><h2>Something need doing?</h2><p>Speaking ahead of the election’s conclusion, World of Warcraft senior producer Samuel Cooper told me that organizing work on the WoW team began in earnest near the end of 2021 after a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-to-pay-about-54-million-to-settle-major-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"><u>since-settled</u></a>) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california"><u>California lawsuit</u></a> alleging instances of harassment, inequality, and bro culture at the company. In the weeks and months that followed, the company put out a series of statements, but in June 2021 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-walkout"><u>Blizzard employees staged a walk-out demanding further action</u></a>. Cooper tells me the walkout was the “spark” that eventually led to further organizing efforts and, now, WoWGG.</p><p>So why did it take three years? Organizing takes time, and 500 people is a <em>lot.</em></p><p>“You can't just fire off an email blast and then have a bunch of people swarm in,” Cooper says. “It's mostly individual conversations between people who know and care about each other. It is gradual, but it's also exponential. The more of those conversations you have, the more people there are having them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cooper tells me he got involved in organizing in hopes of having “a more democratized way of representing employees in the workplace.” He later convinced senior quest designer Paul Cox to join in. Cox tells me he was frustrated that the voices of ground level employees weren’t being represented in Blizzard’s response to the California lawsuit, and he wanted to make sure they were taken into account.</p><p>“This isn't an attack against our World of Warcraft leadership or something where we're like, ‘We hate those guys.’” he said. “We just want to make sure that our voices are being heard and that at some point we don't end up as numbers on a spreadsheet. Because you go up high enough and these people have never met any of us, none of the names mean anything to them.”</p><p>WoWGG’s initial “spark” and early organizing work took place while the company was still independent of Microsoft, but last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>it was acquired</u></a>. As a result, Blizzard employees benefited from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u>Microsoft’s prior commitment to labor neutrality</u></a>, effectively allowing them to organize in the open without company interference.</p><p><strong>Update 1:24pm PT:</strong> Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-union-microsoft-response-1236083616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered the following statement to Variety</a> with regard to today's unionization announcements: "We continue to support our employees’ right to choose how they are represented in the workplace, and we will engage in good faith negotiations with the CWA as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement."</p><p><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p>Cooper adds that Microsoft has upheld its commitment with regards to Blizzard.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc.</p></div><p>“We had a lot of folks who, rightly or wrongly, felt fearful before,” Cooper says. “There are legal protections for organizing, but it can still be scary to have that change…We had CWA folks on campus for weeks on end, right in the middle, next to the big bronze orc. I think that really made people feel like it's not scary. I know they're not allowed to retaliate, but now I have confidence that they're not going to retaliate.”</p><p>Once they were able to organize openly, the WoW team’s efforts picked up speed throughout 2024. Cooper tells me the group was also emboldened by other game unions such as those at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-of-america-union-workers-ratify-contract-less-than-a-year-after-recognition"><u>SEGA</u></a> and fellow Microsoft unions at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize"><u>Zenimax</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-vote-to-form-largest-us-video-game-worker-union-to-date"><u>Activision</u></a>, many of whom had representatives on the Blizzard campus speaking with employees. The group even had a friendly race with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios"><u>unionizing employees at Bethesda Game Studios</u></a>, who won a similar election last week. “In a friendly way, we were seeing who was going to squeak in there first,” Cooper says. “Never happier to be outrun. Huge congratulations to them.”</p><h2>What's worth fighting for</h2><p>Cooper believes that WoWGG’s victory is part of a growing wave of industry unionization in recent years. He hopes their union can serve as inspiration to others, just as SEGA, Zenimax, and Activision inspired them. “Blizzard's a big name. We make great games, we occupy a position in the industry that I think has a lot of influence. The ability to show folks a large, very successful, very long-standing game…is able to do this and able to do it with all of our development groups, not just design or production and design or production design, engineering and art, but quality assurance, too, brought in and treated correctly as full development partners. We hope that that's the start of a paradigm shift across the industry.”</p><p>Though WoWGG is still a ways off from contract negotiations, Cox tells me that two big issues the union wants to put on the table are pay equity and work-from-home. On the latter, he says that most of the WoW team is required to be in office three days a week, and exceptions have been very, very limited. That’s been a huge issue for those who moved out of town during the pandemic, or bought houses, or who struggle to afford living in Irvine, CA. “We've lost some really great folks who have just been like, ‘I don't want to come back into the office. I like the fact that I don't have an hour and a half commute every day,’” Cox says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>World of Warcraft: The War Within Pre-alpha Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Cooper adds, “Long-standing partners who I personally really relied on that we've had to figure out how to move forward without. It's a huge topic for us. Ultimately, how these things shake out in bargaining, how we prioritize pay against promotion transparency, against layoff protections, against work-from-home and other concerns. That'll really be up to our friends and teammates, our members, to survey, but those are big topics.”</p><p>Fundamentally, both Cooper and Cox tell me their desire to unionize comes out of a deep love for Blizzard and the work they do on World of Warcraft. Both of them have been at Blizzard for over 15 years, and feel invested in making it a better place to work for themselves and all their teammates.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good.</p></div><p>“Another one of our organizing committee members said, ‘There's a temptation when things get hard at a job to go look for a job where things are easier. But this is a tough industry, you can jump and you may experience some improvement for a while, but if you want a place to stay good, you've got to make the place good,’” Cooper explains. “Unionizing, I think, it's going to make a difference for us. I think it's going to make a difference for the company, a positive difference that'll help us be more successful in all senses and take better care of our people. I think that's going to ripple out to the industry, even the players. I'm excited for the future.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/courtisans-card-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Gaming has a very long tradition of very small card games that allow players to be very mean to one another. Arguably it goes back to the days of playing cards and the Hearts family of evasive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking</a> where you’re trying to avoid winning points, some versions of which see you passing pain cards to other players, and getting their cruft in turn. </p><div catalogid="53b021f6-76fe-4bb7-a747-922595d8f1dc" id="205185"><div id="205185" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Courtisans Card Game</h3></p></div><p>So it’s a crowded market to venture into, but with it’s super-simple rule set and beautiful cards, Courtisans clearly feels it has the chops to make a splash nevertheless. </p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><p>As a small-box card game, there’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality. The main draw is the main deck of tarot-sized cards in five colors, representing five noble families, each one luminous with characterful artwork and gold embossing. They’re an absolute delight, justaposing a character and its suite symbol – which doubles as a color marker for the colorblind – in the manor of a court card from a deck of playing cards. </p><p>The rest of the compact box is less attractive. There’s a much smaller, much plainer deck of objective cards and a rolled-up board made of printed fabric depicting the families feasting at the queen’s table. The art is in the same grand style as the cards, and rolled up boards are easy to store but fabric, while eco-friendly, isn’t the most practical choice. Because it’s stored in a roll, it won’t lie flat on the table without a sheet of perspex or an iron. This isn’t a major issue during play as cards go above or below the board, not on it, but it is a shame that it doesn’t show off more of that glorious art to full effect.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><p>Gamers have a bit of a reputation for claiming that games are simple when they’re anything but, and this is particularly true of card games when half the rules can be printed on the cards themselves. But Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn. On your turn, you draw three cards from the deck. One, you keep face up in front of you. Another you place, face up, before an opponent of your choice. And the third you place either above or below the Queen’s table, in the column matching its suit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Courtisans really is very straightforward to learn.</p></div><p>Once the deck runs out, suits that have more cards above the table than below are “esteemed” and each one in a player’s tableau is worth a point. Those with more cards below than above are “fallen” and each costs you a point. Cards with a x2 icon are worth double in both reckonings. Tot up your points, and see who’s won. The only other complexities to this formula are a smattering of special cards: spies do not reveal their suit until the game ends, assassins remove a card from whatever area they’re laid in, and guards can’t be assassinated.</p><p>You’ve now learned almost the entire rules of Courtisans. And you would not believe just how much angst is lurking below that smooth, approachable ruleset and those lovely cards.</p><p>The fact that you lay almost all the cards face up, the odd spy excluded, means there’s nowhere to hide. When a pile of red cards are cowering pitifully below the queen’s table, and you give another player a red card, that’s an outright act of aggression. You’re saying, “I want you to lose”, and no amount of apologetic talk or sour-puss facial expressions can disguise it. It’s like the famous, blood-draining, knife-twist betrayals of Diplomacy, allegedly Henry Kissinger's favorite board game, except you haven’t taken seven hours to get there, and you’ll commit a dozen more such hostilities in this game alone.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s not a lot in the small Courtisans box, but what there is is very high quality.</p></div><p>And the game contains a number of ways to make every gut-punch worse. You can give someone an out-of-favor suit and make it worse by adding the same suit to the stack below the table. You can double the misery in both respects by doing the same with one or two x2 cards. You can give someone an assassin in an out-of-favor suit and kill one of their higher scoring, in favor, cards. And then you can rub salt in the wounds by laying the one decent option in your three-card draw in your own tableau.</p><p>This outright, in-your-face meanness does mean that the game works best with four. With two, you’ve only got one target. With three, and to a lesser extent with five, it’s very easy to dogpile one poor player into oblivion relatively early in the game, although given it only takes a quarter-hour to play that’s hardly the end of the world, and no doubt your bullying will be remembered in turn for the next hand. But four strikes the perfect balance of blow and counterblow.</p><p>In all cases, you’ll have to do your level best to direct the pain away from yourself and toward other players, in the time-honored fashion of trying to persuade people to target the current leader. Some people love this kind of trash talk, others hate it, and this probably isn’t a game for them. But to prevent anyone from becoming an easy target, there’s one final cog to the game’s mechanisms: everyone gets two secret missions. These are all straightforward, like ensuring a particular suit is fallen or esteemed or owning two assassins. But they do the job very effectively, muddying the waters and adding to the excitement while giving you a reason to keep a poker face when someone slaps a card down.</p><p>At this point, it feels important to mention that luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve. While the initial few plays are uncertain, mapping out the status of the different suits and the interpersonal dynamics between the players for the game to come, the collection of cards rapidly reaches a level where decision-making is decidedly non-obvious. A simple card might raise or lower someone’s score, but then there are the hidden goals to be aware of. And the special cards inject additional dynamism: assassins in particular make it very difficult to properly weigh the correct course of action. The card itself may be worth a point, or not, but its choice of target can also impact the game in subtle ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Luck of the draw and social engineering aren’t the only tricks Courtisans has up its sleeve.</p></div><p>This uncertainty dovetails beautifully with the social aspects of the game, into an ouroboros that’s likely to end up eating someone at the table along with its tail. You start to feel like every play contains both a social and a strategic message. What does it mean that the player opposite gave a green to their neighbor? Does it say something about their own secret goals, or the spies they placed the turn before? Or is it more of a gotcha revenge moment, for that neighbor dumping rubbish on them early in the game, or even for a disagreement they had last week? Is it worth making an argument out loud for the table? And if so what form should it take, and what will persuade your fellow players that might give you an edge? It’s amazing how such a tiny game can tease at all the communal faultlines around the table. </p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/oeDE6?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0bbx?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Adeew?object_uuid=85486945-6716-4ab9-b11a-32cd71b65e9f&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Pandasaurus</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2024 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Courtisans is a nasty game with very significant random and social factors, and for a chunk of gamers that’s enough to make them walk away. However, in the wide, deep sea of take-that games in which Courtisans belongs, it’s a shark in it’s own right: sleek, powerful and often taking you by surprise. There might not be a whole lot to this box, either in terms of content quantity or rules, but it does what it’s supposed to do pretty much perfectly.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Concord, the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter from Sony's Firewalk Studios, is bucking the battle pass trend, with its developer telling players, "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk Studios announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayConcord/status/1816141419914093045">series of posts</a> on social media, explaining Concord won't have a battle pass because it "wanted to focus [its] attention on making Concord a rewarding and robust experience on day one, where just playing the game, levelling up your accounts and characters, and completing jobs yields meaningful rewards."
</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/markderidder/status/1816152226815172785">seperate post</a>, Concord gameplay animation director Mark DeRidder wrote, "No Battle Pass, folks. You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."
</p>
<p>
It's certainly an increasingly unusual, if not unwelcome, choice in a world where it feels like every major live-service game - including the Sony published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> - comes with a time-sucking seasonal battle pass (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">or two</a>). Firewalk has, however, previously confirmed the £35/$40 game will be further monetised via cosmetic character customisation items.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's posts, the studio noted Concord will include additional cinematics beyond those featured in its recent open beta, and will receive new Freegunners (as its heroes are known), maps, modes, and more in regular post-launch seasons and updates. These will be made available to all players at no additional cost.
</p>
<p>
Firewalk also confirmed Concord will including single-player training modes at launch (but no solo-specific play modes), alongside six "distinct" 5v5 team-based modes, and "multiple" unlockable variants for each of its 16 heroes.
</p>
<p>
Concord launches for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam and Epic on 23rd August. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">took a look at the 5v5 shooter</a>, declaring it good. "The bad news," he continued, "is I can't figure out how good, just yet... Each element done in absolutely the right way, but not necessarily in service of anything more than simply doing things the right way... My fingers are crossed for this one being given enough time to find its identity on the fly."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following on the heels of Friday’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wall-to-wall union at Bethesda Games Studios</a>, over 500 workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> have unionized under the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Like Bethesda’s union, the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild spans departments, including engineers, designers, artists, QA testers and more, in what the Guild calls “ the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio.”</p><p><em>“</em>The decision by workers on <em>World of Warcraft</em> to form a union marks a key inflection point in the broader movement for video game worker organizing industry-wide,” said Tom Smith, Senior Director of Organizing at CWA, in a press release. “This victory, built on years of foundation work since the launch of the Game Workers Unite movement at GDC, reflects a deeply rooted commitment to change. Unionizing one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry.”</p><p>Alongside the WoW Game Makers Guild, 60 Blizzard QA workers in Austin also formed a union today. Microsoft, parent company of Activision Blizzard, signed a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality agreement</a> with the CWA in 2022, agreeing not to stand in the way of organizing workers. That agreement went into effect 60 days after the finalization of Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty promptly, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2,000 people</a> from its gaming division in January 2024. <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closures of four Bethesda studios</a> followed in May. Most recently, the FTC–which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/08/microsoft-activision-acquisition-ftc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to block </a>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2022– <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a letter to the US Court of Appeals</a> accusing the company of “exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged,” following Microsoft’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price hike</a> in early July. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-decries-ftcs-misleading-claims-of-degraded-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> by calling the FTC’s claims “misleading.”&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s easy to read both these unions as direct responses to all of that, the WoW Game Makers Guild makes specific mention of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/07/27/blizzard-employees-walkout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkouts and protests</a> at Blizzard in 2021, which followed the company’s response to California’s sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the company. The press release calls today’s unionization “a significant milestone in [that] journey.”</p><p>It rules to see more unions in the games industry, especially interdisciplinary ones. Finding commonality with your colleagues across differences, and using those commonalities to change your workplace, is one of the best things about unions (ask me how I know!). If you haven’t experienced that for yourself yet, there’s never been a better time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>For those who want a hit of nostalgia, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered has finally gotten an official release date. This eccentric rock and roll adventure will hit Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch as of 31 October 2024. Pre-orders for this classic game are available except for on Nintendo Switch. The team will announce the release dates for this pre-order soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpT42plQiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The trailer</a> for the remaster is up on their YouTube channel and available now.</p>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture will host a Grasshopper Direct on their YouTube channel on July 31, where interested fans can learn more about the upcoming game. Within this Grasshopper Direct, fans can expect to see the producer of Shadow of the Damned, Shinji Mikami, Suda51, and a couple of other members of the team who will all be present to answer your burning questions about the upcoming release, as well as take you on a deep dive into the development of this brand-new remaster.</p>
<p>The remaster of Shadows of the Damned comes with plenty of new features, such as new costumes. This new game plus+ mode carries your weapons and appearances over to your next play through, where the difficulty is upped, but you still get to be just as powerful, if not more so, as before.</p>
<p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered also comes with a new 60 FPS patch and 4K support, giving players the highest fidelity gameplay. Unfortunately for those on Nintendo Switch, you'll still be stuck at 30 FPS, with 4K support limited to Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam.</p>
<p>You play as Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter for those unfamiliar with the game. This comedic game allows you to fight off demons and traverse through Hell, fighting off various horrifying creatures. Garcia Hotspur is on this grand adventure to save the love of his life from a genuinely awful demon king.</p>
<p>Garcia Hotspur is joined by his trusty sidekick, Johnson the Skull, who provides comedic commentary as you explore the depths of Hell. The darkness is a disadvantage to the player as the demons grow ever stronger in the dark. However, blast them with light and utilize your arsenal of weapons, and Garcia Hotspur can take down all the demons.</p>
<p>This game was created by Goichi Suda, also known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/">Suda 51</a>. They are one of Japan's most prolific game developers and have helped develop franchises such as No More Heroes, Killer7, and Fatal Frame.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But SimsGuruNinja, an EA employee who works on the game, happened to be lurking in her chat, and his answer was as interesting as it was cryptic: "But don't worry. Elders will die better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Predictably, the livestream's chat exploded with excitement, with Lilsimsie demanding answers.</p><p dir="ltr">"What do you know?!" she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">SimsGuruNinja replied, "Meant elder [Sims] will LOVE better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the smiley face emojis included at the end of his message, the interaction seemed to indicate that SimsGuruNinja was simply keeping his cards close to the chest for the time being, because his reply to Lilsimsie's initial question about the exercise poster makes no sense in the context of love.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis have been known to hide Easter eggs with hints about future expansion packs within newly released DLCs. Even more damning is the fact that, throughout the Sims franchise, death-by-treadmill has been a relatively common demise for elderly Sims, who are at risk of dying of a heart attack if they do too much cardio with a low Fitness skill. They can even die from "WooHooing" too much. Including a poster of an elderly Sim doing cardio seems rather out-of-place in a DLC focused entirely on romance, which has led to speculation that the strange poster is a hint regarding the content of the game's next expansion pack.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims content creators, leakers, and even developers working on the game have also hinted at the existence of a death-based expansion pack, with one content creator--who also accurately predicted Lovestruck's existence--<a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1811855924430250426" rel="nofollow">cryptically tweeting</a>, "Honestly? I would DIE for another EP this year." Meanwhile, another "Sims guru" shared a cryptic tweet indicating that she's working on something big, and that it has nothing to do with the Lovestruck expansion pack, which releases July 25.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's even more evidence supporting the idea that a deadly new DLC may be on the way, and it's currently tucked away in the game's files. Based on information found via datamining, Sims fans have uncovered a tentative schedule that seems to suggest that another new expansion pack is indeed on the way, and there appear to only be two other DLCs (likely game packs, stuff packs, or kits) scheduled to come out between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sims-4-lovestruck-expansion-pack-adds-depth-to-sims-love-lives/1100-6524571/">Lovestruck</a> and the next expansion pack. According to <a href="https://simscommunity.info/2024/07/24/sims-4-expansion-pack-17-hints/" rel="nofollow">the game's files</a>, the order of release is as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 16</strong> (The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 84</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 85</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 17</strong> (possible "Drop Dead" expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 86</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 87</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 88</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 89</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 18</strong> (unknown expansion)</li></ul><p>Though EA has yet to confirm anything regarding the upcoming expansion--which players are currently calling "the Drop Dead expansion pack"--it would certainly make sense to release a death-themed DLC around Halloween. Additionally, given the amount of time EA and Maxis have recently spent revamping Sims' love lives, it's high time they give ghost-Sims some appreciation, too. Since players now can plan a Sim's wedding right down to the attire of guests and the type of wedding cake topper, letting players plan detailed funerals--and experience fun new ways to kill off their least-favorite Sims--seems only fair.</p><p dir="ltr">Death has always been a major part of the franchise, with Sims capable of dying in a number of comical ways, from being squashed by a rogue Murphy bed (or meteor) to the classic death-by-drowning (in a pool that has had its ladders mysteriously removed by some unseen force). Sims who have obtained a special, very rare flower can plead for the life of a fallen fellow Sim, potentially causing the Grim Reaper to change his mind and let them live. On the other hand, they can always choose to simply let their simulated family member die, then start up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/ymchph/the_grim_reaper_is_my_roomate_and_woohoo_partner/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a romance with the Grim Reaper</a> instead.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> recently found itself in some hot water due to changes it was going to make to its battle pass. The studio had intended to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-will-now-have-two-battle-passes-per-season-says-respawn/1100-6524756/">break up the premium battle pass into two when Season 22 launched</a>. This upset much of the game's fanbase and the outcry worsened as Respawn revealed that players would now have to pay real-world money to unlock both battle passes instead of the usual choice of real money or Apex Coins (Apex Legends premium currency). Apex Legends' battle passes have always awarded Apex Coins, allowing players to purchase new passes by completing previous ones--this change would have removed that perk, meaning individual players would be pouring more money into the game than before</p><p>Shortly after that was announced, a significant portion of the Apex Legends community began pushing back against this. On July 24, Apex Legends issued a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859" rel="nofollow ">official X/Twitter account</a> claiming that the team will not proceed with its original battle pass plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement explains that in Season 22, Apex Legends will continue to allow players to get the premium battle pass for 950 Apex Coins. "We recognize that we could have handled the battle pass changes better--that's on us," the Apex Legends team writes in the statement. When the season launches on August 6, players will have the chance to get the season's first premium battle pass by completing in-game challenges. When the second split occurs on September 17, players can purchase the season's second premium battle pass using the game's premium currency or real money with plans to run with this format going forward after that.</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-announces-changes-to-apex-legends-battle-pass-after-community-outcry" rel="nofollow ">interview with IGN</a>, Steven Ferreira, the creative director of Apex Legends, revealed that the studio had made these changes because the team wanted to be able to "track data on how many players are engaging with the battle pass" and that this was something the team did on its own without EA pushing them one way or the other.</p><p>According to the statement, going forward, whenever the team plans to implement significant changes, it'll slowly roll them out and engage more with the community instead of just dropping them.</p>

That’s because the new football sim is only available on current-gen platforms, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. On PlayStation, this is fairly simple. PS5 games can’t work on PS4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-shakes-things-up-adds-big-white-rectangle-to-ps5-1844325384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-shakes-things-up-adds-big-white-rectangle-to-ps5-1844325384">They look different, too</a></span>. But on Xbox, it’s a mess. Microsoft currently sells or has sold an Xbox Series X, an Xbox Series S, an Xbox One X, an Xbox One S, and even at one point a basic Xbox One. So it’s not surprising to see so many Xbox players leaving negative reviews online after buying the game and realizing they can’t play it.</p><p>“I have an Xbox One X. I did research and saw the X/S and Ones can use Series X games and it doesn’t even allow me to play. It says it is not compatible and you can’t even return the item because once you open the packaging it’s no good and considered used. Waited so long for this game and used to play the old ones just to find out I spent $75 on a game I can’t play,” said one user on Amazon.<br></p><p>“I don’t play video games but my son wanted the game so I bought it for them. Now it doesn’t work and I spent $65 on it,” said someone on Reddit. </p><p>“I need to return this I don’t have the right Xbox for this,” posted a person on Walmart’s website. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.target.com/p/ea-sports-college-football-25-xbox-series-x/-/A-91991657?showOnlyQuestions=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.target.com/p/ea-sports-college-football-25-xbox-series-x/-/A-91991657?showOnlyQuestions=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on Target’s store page for the game</a></span>, you can find tons of questions about which Xbox console it will work on, which one has a disc drive, which one doesn’t, if the digital version works on last-gen machines, and so on. </p><h2 id="h58320"><a id=""></a>This is a really confusing situation</h2><p>Now, you are someone who reads <em>Kotaku</em>. You likely understand that while almost all Xbox One games are playable on Series X, <em>no</em> Series X games are natively playable on the older consoles. But it’s a pretty confusing mess for people who might only play a few games a year, which could be a large chunk of <em>EA College Football</em>’s fanbase.<br></p><p>However, things get even more confusing when you look at how some Xbox games come in plastic cases that list both Xbox Series X/S <em>and</em> Xbox One. In fact, what with the ever-increasing blurring of console generations, a lot of games are playable on both and sold as such. And then you have the other wrinkle that,  technically you can play <em>some </em>Xbox Series X/S games on an Xbox One via cloud streaming. </p><figure id="" data-id="7beb5cc90f08b439678c99cd8863297c" data-recommend-id="image://7beb5cc90f08b439678c99cd8863297c" data-format="png" data-width="1659" data-height="613" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Xbox store page for the College Football / Madden bundle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oh and let’s add even more confusion to the mix. <em>Madden 25,</em> which is out in August, is launching on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. And EA’s <em>Madden </em>series has been playable on Xbox One since 2013's entry, which was confusingly named <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25_(2013_video_game)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25_(2013_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Madden 25</em></a></span>, which is also the name of the <em>new </em>one coming out later this year. Sigh. Anyway,  I imagine a ton of people playing <em>Madden </em>every year on Xbox One are the same people excited to play <em>EA College Football 25</em> this year.<br></p><p>In fact, those people might have bought the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-mvp-bundle-madden-nfl-25-deluxe-edition-college-football-25-deluxe-edition/9MZB0BJFVCTS/0010/B3TWNK19RKL6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-mvp-bundle-madden-nfl-25-deluxe-edition-college-football-25-deluxe-edition/9MZB0BJFVCTS/0010/B3TWNK19RKL6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently available bundle</a></span> that comes with both <em>Madden NFL 25</em> and <em>EA College Football 25</em>. Here’s the weird catch: <em>Madden NFL 25</em> is still coming out on Xbox One this year. So that bundle contains a game playable on both generations of console and a game playable on only one. Phew. It’s enough to make even my head start to spin.<br></p><p>Should these buyers have done more research? Maybe. Does Xbox’s store state directly that you can’t play<em> EA College Football 25</em> on Xbox One? Yes—in somewhat small print, but yes. The warning is there. But this whole situation is so confusing and silly that I don’t blame folks for thinking EA’s latest sports game would, like <em>Maddens </em>before and upcoming, play on Xbox One. And I don’t blame them for getting frustrated to find out that’s not the case. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 500 developers at Blizzard Entertainment who work on <em>World of Warcraft </em>have voted to form a union. The <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild, formed with the assistance of the Communication Workers of America (CWA), is composed of employees across every department, including designers, engineers, artists, producers, and more. Together, they have formed the largest wall-to-wall union — or a union inclusive of multiple departments and disciplines — at Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>This news comes less than a week after the formation of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202271/bethesda-game-studios-workers-unionize-cwa">Bethesda Game Studios union</a>, which, at the time of the announcement, was itself the largest wall-to-wall Microsoft union. </p><p>In a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em>, Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons wrote, “We continue to support our employees’ right to choose how they are represented in the workplace, and we will engage in good faith negotiations with the CWA as we work towards a collective bargaining agreement.”</p><p>These unions represent a major shift in video game union organization strategy, and <em>The Verge</em> spoke to two members of Blizzard’s organization committee about how this union came to be and the challenges of organizing such a large and comprehensive group.</p><p>Kathryn Friesen, a quest designer on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> team, spoke about how the impetus for the union came out of the desire to uphold one of Blizzard’s company values: “every voice matters.”</p><p>“You can tell just by talking to people how much they care about one another and the work that they do in the game,” Friesen said. “I think that that’s where [the unionization effort] comes from, the desire to stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights at the table.”</p><p>Paul Cox, senior quest designer and Blizzard veteran, agreed, saying that the company’s response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay">the state of California’s discrimination lawsuit</a> spurred employee action. “A lot of the early responses felt very corporate and didn’t feel like they reflected the values that, as a company, we said we upheld,” Cox said.&nbsp;</p><div><p>As a result, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit">employees at Blizzard took action with walkouts</a>, which became the beginning of unionization efforts at the company.</p></div><p>The <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild is made up of over 500 members across Blizzard offices in California and Massachusetts. Despite its size — it is the second largest union at Microsoft overall behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">Activision’s 600-member QA union</a> — Cox said that <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement</a> helped get the organization ball rolling.</p><p>“We were able to come out into the open about it, and everybody was able to see that no retaliation was occurring,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>With organization efforts out in the open, including CWA tents on Blizzard campuses, Friesen said that getting people across all the different departments was made simpler, too.</p><p>“Across departments, we had a lot of support,” she said. “I think we are actually well above 50 percent [union support] in each specific department.”&nbsp;</p><p>Interdisciplinary unions like Blizzard’s are relatively rare, especially in the video game industry, as each department has different needs and goals. Up until this point, the majority of unionization efforts in the video game industry have been spearheaded by QA workers who have traditionally been among the least paid and least protected employees.</p><p>The first union at Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22901563/raven-software-union-game-workers-alliance-activision-blizzard">was made up of QA workers</a>, as was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23495139/microsoft-union-zenimax-bethesda-cwa">the first union at Microsoft’s game studios</a>. In addition to the <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild, yet another new union made up of QA workers at Blizzard’s Austin, Texas, office has also formed. The Blizzard Quality Assurance United-CWA is a 60-person unit including QA testers for games like <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Hearthstone</em>, and other Blizzard games.</p><p>“It is really, really great that we are a wall-to-wall union. We’re all in it together, and it’s a signal that QA is dev as well. I am especially excited for that signal to go out to the rest of the industry,” Friesen said. “[QA employees] work with us every single day. Their desks are next to our desks. So, I hope that we can win better workplace protections for everyone on the team.”</p><p><strong>Update July 24th, 6:50 PM ET:</strong> <em>Added a statement from Microsoft.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Honestly, they’re tough to miss.</p><p>But most importantly, you must farm the right locations, such as:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Morgantown Airport (Exterior)</li><li>Tyler County Fairgrounds</li><li>Bolton Greens</li><li>Helvetia</li><li>Wavy Willard’s Water Park</li><li>Camden Park</li></ul><p>You’re likely to stumble upon Festive Scorched in any point of interest where normal Scorched usually spawn, but these six locations tend to have the most luck.</p><figure id="" data-id="68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-recommend-id="image://68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-recommend-id="image://68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, they’re also the most highly frequented by the community. You may wind up traveling to Morgantown Airport, as I did this morning, only to find the entire camp clear of all enemies. Then, the same thing happened at Bolton Greens. People want to participate in this event, seemingly more so than usual, so expect company.</p><p>Alternatively, if you subscribe to Fallout 1st, you can enter a Private World. It’s the best way to farm Holiday Scorched without competing with an entire server of interested players.</p><h2 id="h56351"><a id="craft"></a> How to craft Holiday Gifts yourself</h2><figure id="" data-id="064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-recommend-id="image://064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-recommend-id="image://064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, instead of farming Holiday Scorched, you can craft Holiday Gifts yourself. First, you must purchase Gift Wrap from train station vendors or Grahm. They’ll sell you:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Low-Quality Gift Wrap</li><li>Medium Quality Gift Wrap</li><li>High-Quality Gift Wrap</li></ul><p>These items prove rather expensive, though. For instance, the High-Quality Gift Wrap may cost upwards of 2,000 caps or more, and the potential rewards vary significantly.</p><p>Once you have Gift Wrap, visit the Tinker’s Workbench at your C.A.M.P. to craft a Holiday Gift. You will need to spend resources, along with the Gift Wrap, so prep your stockpile of materials beforehand!</p><h2 id="h56352"><a id="plans"></a>Plans you can score from Holiday Gifts</h2><p>While regular rewards are fine, like the occasional piece of apparel or a handful of grenades, we all want plans for better gear, right? You can score numerous fantastic plans from the Holiday Gifts, including:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Plan: .44 Blue Camo Paint</li><li>Plan: Barbed Wire Fences</li><li>Plan: Behemoth Plushie</li><li>Plan: Blue Camo Power Armor Paints</li><li>Plan: Brahmin Plushie</li><li>Plan: Condemned Notification Sign</li><li>Plan: Deer Skull</li><li>Plan: Molerat Wind Chime</li><li>Plan: Mounted Deathclaw Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Feral Ghoul Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Frog</li><li>Plan: Mounted Glowing One Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Gorilla Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Honey Beast</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mega Sloth</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mirelurk Claw</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mirelurk Hunter Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mirelurk King Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mothman</li><li>Plan: Mounted Mutant Hound Head</li><li>Plan: Mounted Radscorpion</li><li>Plan: Mounted Radtoad</li><li>Plan: Mounted Scorchbeast</li><li>Plan: Mounted Snallygaster</li><li>Plan: Musket Stack Monument</li><li>Plan: Nuka Girl Area Rug</li><li>Plan: Princess Castle Pink Sleeping Bag</li><li>Plan: Red Rocket Gas Pump Wall Lamp</li><li>Plan: Red Rocket Gas Station Lamp</li><li>Plan: Red Rocket Ceiling Light</li><li>Plan: Santa Crash</li><li>Plan: Sitting Gorilla</li><li>Plan: Standing Gorilla</li><li>Plan: Tattered Curtains</li><li>Plan: Vault 51 Jumpsuit</li><li>Plan: Vintage Water Cooler</li><li>Plan: Wall Mounted Fan</li><li>Plan: Winter Icicle Lights</li></ul><hr><p>Considering the rarity of many crafting plans, it makes plenty of sense why everyone is farming the Holiday Scorched Event in <em>Fallout 76</em>.

<p>New gameplay for Star Wars Outlaws has leaked online ahead of its August.</p>



<p>The leak comes from known<a href="https://x.com/404LEAKbackup/status/1816188519016194493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> leaker Visceral</a> and 404 leaks online, and shows over 13 minutes of gameplay and cutscenes.</p>



<p>The footage shows what appears to be the beginning of the game. Right at the start it cuts to Kay Vess recovering from a crash and discovering her bike to travel across the planet. If you are worried about major spoilers, it doesn’t appear to have anything too big from the game’s story.</p>



<p>If you want to watch it, you can below before it likely is removed.</p>

<p>During a recent earnings call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the company has put <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-marketing-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more into the marketing of the game</a> than any other Ubisoft title ever.</p>



<p>The footage appears to originate from press and content creator access, where previews of the game will be coming by the end of the month.</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Those who buy the game’s season pass get access to an exclusive Jabba The Hut mission at launch that Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-responds-to-star-wars-outlaws-backlash-over-jabba-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says isn’t key to the game’s story</a>.</p>

            <p>
Apex Legends developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> has said it will once again allow players to purchase the free-to-play shooter's battle passes with in-game premium currency after it announced it would only be selling them for real money starting in Season 22.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Respawn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">unveiled a number of controversial changes</a> to Apex Legends' existing battle pass system, in a move it insisted would provide more "value" to players. One of these changes will see the current season-long Battle Pass essentially split in two, with Respawn charging players full price for each half-season premium pass across the same amount of time.
</p>
<p>
However, the change that attracted perhaps the most fan ire was Respawn's decision to begin charging real money for its battle passes, and no longer enable players to purchase them with premium currency. That's significant as Apex Legends' premium battle passes have traditionally rewarded enough premium currency to purchase the next season's pass.

<p>
Now, though, the studio has formally reversed that decision in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">statement shared on social media</a>. "You've spoken, and we've listened," it wrote. "With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognise that we could have handle the Battle Pass Changes better - that's on us."
</p>
<p>
Respawn also confirms each battle pass will still include enough Apex Coins across its various unlockable tiers to purchase the next one.
</p>
<p>
"Moving forward, we recognise that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our communications with you," the studio continued. "Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it's why we're acknowledging them here... Thank you again for all of your passion and time in Apex Legends because we couldn't do this without you."
</p>
<p>
Apex Legends' 21st season, Upheaval, started in May and is due to conclude in August. Respawn has confirmed that once Season 22 begins, players can unlock the first of its two battle passes for free by completing a series of "simple" in-game challenges.

<p>On July 19th, a worldwide incident known as the ‘blue screen of death’ affected&nbsp;millions of Microsoft computers, rendering them non-functional for several hours. Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later revealed</a> that a software update from an independent cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike, caused this incident. Recent developments have shown that CrowdStrike is offering the affected users a $10 gift card as an apology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/24/crowdstrike-offers-a-10-apology-gift-card-to-say-sorry-for-outage/?utm_source=whatsapp&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, CrowdStrike’s Chief Business Officer, Daniel Bernard, emailed the affected users to acknowledge the blue-screen incident between July 18 and 19. A screenshot of this email has now surfaced on X (formerly Twitter). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To express their “heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience”, CrowdStrike wants to pay for the “next cup of coffee or late night snack” for the impacted users with a $10 Uber Eats Gift card, the email states. The affected users in the United Kingdom received a £ 7.75 gift card, which revealed another user.</p>



<p>Some users could successfully redeem the gift card from CrowdStrike, whereas some weren’t as lucky. Those who couldn’t were met with an error message on Uber Eats stating that the gift card “has been cancelled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.”</p>



<p>Additionally, to prevent such incidents in the future, CrowdStrike informed the users that their cloud services have been improved to “dramatically speed up their ability to make rapid communication to the sensor.” The company has published a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Preliminary Incident Report</a> today, detailing the incident and the steps taken to prevent its recurrence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the movie finally releasing nine years after it was first announced, Randy Pitchford said in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-cinematic-universe-first-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past interview</a> that the first film is the “start” of a Borderlands cinematic universe.</p>



<p>“The Borderlands movie is the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe and you’ll see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games,” he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-borderlands-the-movie">About Borderlands The Movie:</h2>



<p><em>Lilith , an infamous bounty hunter with a mysterious past, reluctantly returns to her home, Pandora, the most chaotic planet in the galaxy. Her mission is to find the missing daughter of Atlas, the universe’s most powerful S.O.B. Lilith forms an unexpected alliance with a ragtag team of misfits – Roland , a seasoned mercenary on a mission; Tiny Tina , a feral pre-teen demolitionist; Krieg, Tina’s musclebound protector; Tannis, the oddball scientist who’s seen it all; and Claptrap a wiseass robot. </em></p>



<p>T<em>ogether, these unlikely heroes must battle an alien species and dangerous bandits to uncover one of Pandora’s most explosive secrets.
