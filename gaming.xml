			<p>Diving into <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> Part One "Bloom," I had a lot of high hopes. I love story-based games where you have to make decisions that will have consequences later down the line. The aesthetic of this game also really pulled me in. I love games that have that retro feel and are full of neon vibrancy that is reminiscent of the 90s. Despite being neon, it has a beautiful muted feel to it at times and really provides the grittiness and dated feel to help you travel back in time.</p>
<p>Loading the game for the first time, you're immediately pulled into a gritty cutscene, giving you glimpses of the events that took place that summer. As soon as that unraveled before me, my interest was peaked. It slows right down quickly soon after that, as you play as Swann gets a phone call from her mother. Examining items in the car, I immediately noticed the masks and became very aware that it took place during the pandemic, a time I would much rather forget. For those who had a difficult time during the pandemic, this game may prove to be a little bit uncomfortable at times, with the reminders that crop up throughout the story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_3efe444163d418f162a8ec19c4a7039c444b93e2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After the scene in the car, you are introduced to Swann as a teenager who loves to film everything she can with her camcorder. This was something that I spent a lot of time doing. Getting to see the environments through the camcorder was a lot of fun and very nostalgic. It also reminded me a lot of Life is Strange, and the collectibles being in the form of photographs. Instead, you would film a bunch of scenes of life happening around Velvet Cove to create a memoir. Whether this was birds, items moving in place, or your gang of friends, there were lots of optional memoirs to create alongside the story-based ones.</p>
<p>What really helped elevate the game's aesthetic was the art style that went with it. While music played an important part in the game, having the color schemes of the 90s helped bring the game to life. I loved the lighting that was used to reflect off of objects in the world, as well as the characters. Seeing Nora, Kat, Autumn, and Swann bathed in neon lights was one of my favorite aspects of the game, and it made me happy to see that a photo mode had been implemented into Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>
<p>Getting to examine items from around the world, such as the books and videotapes in Swann's bedroom, helped me remember my own childhood and fond memories of mixtapes, CDs, and videotapes. I loved the amount of detail that went into every little thing that you could examine. Whether it was a beer bottle in the park or a book in Swann's room, there was so much detail, and love poured into this game to help provide a true, immersive experience in the 90s. Every recording helped to build the world up further, as well as provide beneficial evidence in tough situations.</p>
<p>While the game is quite a slow burn, it helps set up the story for the second episode, which I am eagerly awaiting. There's a lot of unanswered questions, and I'm excited to see where this supernatural tale will end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_a1c06cd0be3234b375eaad5c44662135aee55a08.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That being said, there were moments in Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage that were a little awkward. With games that rely on your choices impacting the story, there are often a lot of pauses to allow you time to respond. However, in this game, the conversations feel a little bit too drawn out, even when I'm not actively contributing to the conversation. Pauses are long, and conversations often overlap. While this would make sense since it's a group of people all talking to each other, sometimes the option to give a response comes in a bit too late, and it feels wrong to contribute to the conversation. I found this to be an issue predominantly with Swann, as she is quite an awkward teenager and is very nervous around people.</p>
<p>In addition to this, some of the animations for the conversations were a little bit wonky. For example, when you finally meet up with Autumn at the bar in Velvet Cove, sometimes you can hear the voice-over of the conversation that is taking place, but her mouth isn't moving. Alternatively, her mouth moves after a delay, and she only says half of the sentence or after it has already been said. While these issues were relatively minor, they did break the game's immersion and lessen the impact of conversations, as it became something I focused on.</p>
<p>Although it's to be expected, I did wish that the game had a save option rather than relying solely on autosaves. Because of this, it meant that saves were pretty few and far between, meaning I had to commit to some beefy gaming sessions to make progress in the story, as well as having to get to a certain point before the game was saved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, getting to experience the conversations between the girls was a lot of fun and reminded me a lot of my own childhood and adolescence, just without the supernatural elements to go along with it. The game is very aesthetically pleasing, and there is a ton of optional content that you can do within the time frame of playing the main game due to the function of the camcorder.</p>
<p>Certain parts did feel a little bit drawn out, especially the scene of Swann and Autumn collecting Autumn's keys. A lot of that scene was Swann and Autumn reminiscing on the past and how they became friends at that very moment. Despite that, it felt like it ran on longer than it needed to, which really added to the slow-burn effect of walking through their adolescence.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/">playing as adults</a>, it felt like it progressed a bit quicker, and the scenes in adulthood weren't as long as those in adolescence. I look forward to seeing how this story will conclude in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second tape</a>, and I hope I get to hunt for more collectibles again.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Xbox have announced a new generative AI technology known as Muse that could help with game preservation. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> going over the new tech, Microsoft says that there is a belief that Muse can change how games are preserved and how players experience classic titles.</p>



<p>“Today, countless classic games tied to aging hardware are no longer playable by most people,” Fatima Kardar, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of gaming AI said. “Thanks to this breakthrough, we are exploring the potential for Muse to take older back catalog games from our studios and optimize them for any device.”</p>



<p>Due to it still being early in hits lifecycle, no examples of how exactly the Muse technology can work with game preservation on Xbox were shared, but it seems like Microsoft is gung ho about the possibilities.</p>



<p>“We believe this could radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future and make them accessible to more players,” Kardar said. “To imagine that beloved games lost to time and hardware advancement could one day be played on any screen with Xbox is an exciting possibility for us.”</p>



<p>If you want to read more about the Muse technology, Microsoft has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full research blog</a> on what went into its development.</p>

                <p>Humble has launched an awesome new video game bundle geared toward retro enthusiasts.

All told, this bundle includes 69 games for only $20,  which breaks down to 29 cents per game.</p><p>Unlike many Humble Bundles, the Capcom retro bundle doesn't have tiers; it's an all-or-nothing collection of Steam games that's available to purchase until March 11. The bundle supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As usual, you can donate more than the minimum $20 and adjust the ratio of your donation between the charity, the publisher, and Humble.</p><p>If the number of games included sounds abnormally high, that's because the bulk of the inclusions are technically paid DLC within Capcom's pair of Arcade Stadium collections. Capcom Arcade Stadium is a free download, but adding games to the platform requires cash. With this Humble Bundle, you'll get a key for Arcade Stadium and Arcade Stadium 2 that instantly unlocks a wide assortment of games.</p><p>Capcom Arcade Stadium is a well-curated collection of '80s and '90s arcade games, including both Mega Man arcade games, great shoot-'em-ups such as 1943, classic platformers like Strider, and numerous entries from Capcom's popular fighting game series. In addition to several versions of Street Fighter 2, you're also getting the brilliant trilogy of Street Fighter Alpha games as well as Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. You'll also find multiple Darkstalkers games and Final Fight. Even better, you can see just how much of your muscle memory you've retained for these games thanks to the inclusion of online multiplayer (for select titles).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4446510-capcomarcadeclassics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446510" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4446510-capcomarcadeclassics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446510"></a><figcaption>Capcom Arcade Classics &amp; Fighters Pack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4446510-capcomarcadeclassics.jpg"></figure><p>The Arcade Stadium collections allow you to recreate the look and feel of an arcade with custom backdrops and machines, and there are also numerous quality-of-life updates to make revisiting these games a little easier.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has long been speculated when the time would come for generative AI models to be widely used in game development to actually create gameplay, and it seems like that time is coming with Muse, an Xbox one-of-a-kind AI model that was unveiled today.</p>
<p>Presented today on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>, Muse is a generative AI model that can essentially generate gameplay based on visuals or players' controller actions, understanding a 3D game world and physics and reacting to how players interact with a game. The model was trained on human gameplay data from Ninja Theory's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/">Bleeding Edge</a>, giving it access to the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, a close collaboration that gave Microsoft Research the chance to understand what needs to be in place for the model and how to access a large amount of gameplay data.</p>
<p>However, Xbox's Muse AI model is still in the early stages of development. It can only generate gameplay visuals at a very low resolution of 300 x 180, so it will be some time before it can be used for anything practical. At the same time, Microsoft stresses that it will never be used to replace actual game developers but only empower them, as it can be used, for example, in the early stages of development. Something that is really hard to believe, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">sad state of the video games industry.</a></p>
<p>In addition to aiding in new game development, Xbox's Muse AI model could also be used to improve classic games and bring them to modern consoles, according to Phil Spencer. These models and their ability to learn how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on original hardware will provide new opportunities for game preservation, according to the Microsoft Gaming CEO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I reported in November that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290468/microsoft-xbox-ai-features-copilot-development-notepad">about to start a bigger effort</a> to bring AI features to Xbox, and today, the company is unveiling what it’s calling a breakthrough in AI for gaming. Microsoft’s new Muse AI model could help Xbox developers create parts of games in the future, and the company says it’s even exploring the potential of using it to preserve classic games and optimize them for modern hardware.</p><p>Microsoft Research <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/?p=1122837">has created Muse</a>, a first-of-its-kind generative AI model that can generate a game environment based on visuals or players’ controller actions. It understands a 3D game world and game physics and can react to how players interact with a game.</p><p>“This allows the model to create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI, demonstrating a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">explains Fatima Kardar</a>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft.</p><p>The Muse model was trained on a large amount of human gameplay data from the Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em> thanks to a collaboration between Microsoft Research and Xbox studio Ninja Theory — both of which are based in Cambridge in the UK. “This partnership allowed us to closely collaborate with the game studio to understand what needs to be in place and how we can responsibly unlock access to a large amount of gameplay data,” says Katja Hofmann, head of Microsoft Research’s game intelligence team.</p><p>This allowed Muse to access the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, resulting in the model being trained on a billion image action pairs in total. It’s a milestone research project that’s being <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">published in <em>Nature</em> today</a>, but as it’s early work, the model is limited to generating gameplay visuals at a resolution of just 300×180 pixels. That’s up from the 128 x 128 resolution of Microsoft’s earlier work on generative AI gaming models, but it’s still far behind the 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution that is common among PC gamers.</p><p>Microsoft has released a number of examples of the Muse model in action, generating gameplay and even allowing players to load visual elements into the game to prompt the model. This could be used for the early iteration stages of a game, but Microsoft is stressing this isn’t designed to generate an entire game and replace creators.</p><p>“For Xbox, the principles that drive our approach to AI are to create more value for players and game creators, bring more games to more people around the world, and recognize that the development of a great game will always be grounded in the creator’s vision and artistry,” says Kardar. “We believe generative AI has the potential to enhance this creativity and unlock new possibilities.”</p><p>During a press briefing, Hofmann also demonstrated a real-time version of Muse that Microsoft is currently experimenting with to enable interactive AI-powered games. The demo generated game visuals on the fly in real time and even reacted to objects being dropped into the game to change the environment. While the real-time gameplay only ran at 10fps and a 300×180 resolution, it was an early demonstration of what might be possible in the future.</p><p>Microsoft is now exploring how Muse could help improve classic games and bring them to modern hardware. “You could imagine a world where from gameplay data and video that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,” says Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. “We’ve talked about game preservation as an activity for us, and these models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity.”</p><p>Microsoft is also exploring how Muse can help game developers prototype games or how teams could add new AI-powered experiences to existing titles. Some short interactive AI game experiences will be available on Copilot Labs soon for people to try out. Microsoft is also planning to share AI tools and experiments with Xbox players and creators “earlier on” so that it can “make sure that our AI innovations address real problems and add new value to creating or playing with Xbox.”</p><p>While Microsoft is still in the exploration phase of AI in gaming, it’s also making it clear it’s up to individual studios at Xbox how they want to use AI in games. “As part of this, we have empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI. There isn’t going to be a single solution for every game or project, and the approach will be based on the creative vision and goals of each team,” says Kardar.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear from game developers and studios about how AI could affect the creative process of making games, particularly at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610851/crysis-4-on-hold-crytek-layoffs">barely a week</a> goes by without <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614819/marvel-rivals-us-layoffs-netease">layoffs in the gaming industry</a>. A recent report revealed that 1 in 10 game developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">lost their jobs in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>“We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” says Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews. “I think the interesting aspect for us that’s exciting, is how can we use technology like this to make the process of making games quicker and easier for our talented team, so that they can really focus on the thing that’s really special about games: the human creativity.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk%E2%80%99s-remaster-remake-announcement%E2%80%94everything-we-know-so-far.1113387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-remaster-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Future Tony Hawk’s Remasters and Remakes games seemed unlikely. However, not only are discussions underway, but a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake could be in production.</p>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a critical and commercial success. It quickly sold a million copies and reminded everywhere why it’s one of the most heralded franchises in gaming history. It featured all the beloved levels and modes from the original two games and added many modern Tony Hawk’s mechanics and additional content.</p>



<p>A remaster of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4 was on the cards—until it wasn’t. Activision canceled the project, leaving all of us disappointed. Quicker than you can land a 360 Melon, the dream might no longer be stuck in the half-pipeline.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-or-remake-happening">Is a Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a franchise. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Activision has yet to offer anything concrete on a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake, but evidence suggests it’s happening, and might arrive sooner than anyone expects.</strong></p>



<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones—already a two-time Thrasher Skate of the Year winner—let slip he’s appearing in an upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster</a>. “<strong>I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out</strong> so that’s cool,” he said. “They got a new one they <strong>remastering</strong> so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one,” said Jones.</p>



<p>It’s not declarative proof, however, common sense is a Tony Hawk’s remaster is coming. Activision canceled plans for future Tony Hawk’s games, but Birdman himself (Hawk) stated in September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks with Activision had resumed</a>.</p>



<p>He was brief but candid when he commented on a new project: “I wish I could tell you more. But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk teased more Pro Skater</a> information about a new game a couple of weeks later: “I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, <strong>but there will be a future</strong>.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-could-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-be-announced">When Could a Tony Hawk’s Remaster be Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Gaming insider eXtas1s has suggested the rumored Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate Remake could arrive as early as the June 2025 Xbox Showcase Event.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> is known for their gaming leaks—which are quite accurate. Not only did the gaming personality give a timeframe for the announcement, but they think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster will be a shadow drop</a> once the showcase ends.</p>



<p><strong>This means it will be released the same day it is announced.</strong> Stay tuned as we try to learn more about this incredible development.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-thps-games-could-be-remastered">Which THPS Games Could be Remastered?</h2>



<p>As many as <strong>10-15 Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games could be in contention</strong>, but it’s likely a dual remaster of <strong>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Honestly, Activision can remaster them all and I will buy them. I grew up looking forward to a new Tony Hawk’s game every Christmas. But given the success and starting point of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Remaster, I think a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remaster feels the most likely outcome.</p>



<p>Again, take this guide with a pinch of salt until we hear more. All signs are pointing toward a Tony Hawk’s Remaster though, so keep checking back as we update this with the newest details.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your fondest memories from the third and fourth THPS levels? I still recall blasting Motorhead’s Ace of Spades while shredding it up in Airport. Or are you secretly hoping Activision chooses different games such as the Underground series?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-address-biggest-isssues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-brings-more-deckbuilding-madness-demo-available-now.1113363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big Fan Games and developer Shiny Shoe have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>, and you can try it out right now if you want to.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/BigFanPresents/status/1892227902936093175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Big Fan over on X,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will boast "new clans, card types [and] gameplay twists", as well as new factions and challenges to take on. Of course, the core gameplay, in which you'll defend your Pyre across three vertical gameplay fields, remains intact.</p>

<p>This time around, the story revolves around Titans, powerful beings who have "seized control of Heaven". It's up to you to command the forces of angels and demons in order to fight back against the Titans and reclaim the heavens from their machinations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=SWv412AE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=t02F_REf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>brings more deckbuilding madness soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Shiny Shoe is promising five new clans for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, each of which will bring its own unique strengths to the table.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to experiment with two new types of card in the form of Room and Equipment Cards. The former adds new boosts to your train, while the latter can be applied to units to help them (and you!) out in combat.</p>

<p>Much like in roguelites like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>has a hub area to which you'll return after each run. The Covenant Outpost is where you'll customize your train, take on new challenges, and interact with the game's characters to move the story forward.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will be published by Devolver Digital subsidiary Big Fan Games, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies" rel="nofollow">effectively the successor to Good Shepherd Games</a> (also a Devolver subsidiary and the publisher of the original&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>).</p>

<p>If you want to try the game out, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>, where a demo awaits you. It doesn't sound like that demo is available on other platforms, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If you ignored the ennui-drenched tannoy announcement because you were paying sixteen pounds at Cafe Nero for a limp panini last time around, Monster Train is a card flickenin' roguelite strategy, and one of the better ones, too. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> breezed into my life like a man wearing a trenchcoat stuffed with cocaine," wrote Matt (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">his review from 2020.</a> "I've been playing Shiny Shoe's roguelike deckbuilder almost every night since, and I have no intention of stopping. Monster Train is at least as good as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>."</p>
<p>The full game is "leaving the station later this year", say developers Shiny Shoe. Easy on the low hanging puns there, please. I'll be out of a salary and the single off-peak return it allows me to buy every two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Choices have consequences. Unfortunately for Sony, one particular decision has led the company to missing out on a couple of the biggest franchises in gaming. The PlayStation team decided not to publish Demon's Souls globally in 2009, which led to a sour taste for the now-well-known studio From Software. That meant the developer looked elsewhere for a publisher with Dark Souls, according to former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-didnt-want-sony-to-publish-dark-souls-as-it-was-disappointed-by-how-demons-souls-was-treated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that Yoshida explained why Sony didn't publish <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/">Dark Souls</a> while appearing on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">the Secret Symbols podcast</a>. It wasn't because the PlayStation team wasn't interested, per Yoshida. "From Software was already working on the sequel [to Demon's Souls], but they were so disappointed with how PlayStation treated them, we wanted to work with them again but they passed on it," said Yoshida.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1605558238" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Souls in North America for PS3, while Bandai Namco handled similar duties in Europe. Sony reportedly passed on bringing the action-RPG to other worldwide markets because the PlayStation team didn't think it would appeal to the mass market. Ultimately, Demon's Souls ended up being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYBivaVco8">GameSpot's game of the year in 2009</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Afterward, From Software partnered with Bandai Namco for the Dark Souls franchise, which spawned three games. From there, Bandai Namco has also worked with the developer on the critically acclaimed Elden Ring series, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6529408/">Elden Ring Nightreign launching on May 30</a>. So, in retrospect, Sony missed out on handling these two massive properties over the past 15 years.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Sony did team up with From Software again for the PS4 exclusive Bloodbourne. "We have huge respect for [From Software president Hidetaka] Miyazaki, and we were able to work with them again," Yoshida said. "Bloodborne is one of his best games."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/">Yoshida retired from Sony after 31 years</a> with the company. Yoshida started his career as an accountant and rose up to be the Sony Interactive Entertainment worldwide president for over a decade before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/">taking an indies job within the company</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/monster-train-2-chugs-to-release-this-year-with-a-debut-demo-playable-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Monster Train 2 has been announced, a full-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite that is set to pull into the station later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC. But there’s even better news for fans of the original, because <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo is out today on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Train 2 looks to build on the original’s three-floor battle system while tasking you with stopping the hugely powerful Titans from destroying the world. That means that – gasp – Heaven and Hell will be forming an alliance? And journeying together to the homeworld of the Titans, the Abyss.</p>
<p>You’ll have new enemy factions to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types.&nbsp;Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

			<p>Despite what the live service push announced some time ago, PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst is reportedly not forcing teams to develop live service games.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great"> Push Square</a>, former PlayStation Studios CEO Shuhei Yoshida spoke with Sacred Symbols+ about the now infamous live service push that has yet to produce any result, saying that, to his knowledge, first-party studios are not being forced by current CEO Hermen Hulst to develop live service games, although the big initiative did in some way push studios to work on this type of game. According to Yoshida-san, when studios see the company has a big initiative, riding on it gives them a better chance to get a project approved and supported.</p>
<p>Among the games that were part of the PlayStation Studios' live service push but were eventually canceled was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-online-devs-tease-their-canceled-game-it-was-the-highlight-of-my-career/">The Last of Us Online</a>. During the interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacerd Symbols+</a>, Shuhei Yoshida confirmed he had played the game and that it was great. However, after a conversation with Bungie, Naughty Dog realized they couldn't support a live service game and work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Project</a> at the same time, so they canceled the project to focus on the single-player game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, PlayStation Studios' live service push has yet to produce any results. Last year's Concord was a complete failure, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">going offline shortly after launch</a>, while other projects that were part of the initiative, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War game by Bluepoint</a>, have been canceled.</p>

Well, twice. It’s that often. <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> ensures that your rodent power fantasy can be played out in all its gory glory in this animal-slaying sequel. If you’re interested in this second outing from developer Odd Bug Studio, you’re probably wondering how much of your life is going to be devoted to it.

While some may prefer a game that’ll take over your life for the foreseeable, there are many others who just want something they can finish. If your main goal is to mainline to reach the credits of <em>Tales of Iron 2</em>, you can expect it to come in at around <strong>10-12 hours</strong> on its normal “Tails of Iron” difficulty. This makes it reasonably longer than the original game, which could be beaten in about 8 hours.</p><p>Of course, there are also easier and harder difficulties, named “Fairy Tale” and “Bloody Whiskers”, respectively. Depending on which of these you may opt for, your playtime is almost certain to be reduced or extended to some capacity.</p><p>However, as with any soulslike experience, there is more meat on the bones of <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> if you wish to see it. You can go for full completion to snag all trophies or achievements, which will require you to engage with all of the game’s content, including completing all of the hunts, collecting all of the tarot cards, and defeating a certain number of different enemy types.</p><p>If you aim to 100 percent <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>, you can expect your total playtime to land between <strong>15 and 20 hours</strong>. That may not sound like a lot for a soulslike game (especially if you’re used to massive adventures like <em>Elden Ring</em>), but it’s pretty solid for an indie side-scroller that only runs $25.</p><hr><p><em>Tails of Iron 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike <em>Pokémon Go</em>, an augmented reality game meant to be played by groups of people wandering outside looking for whimsical creatures, the board game adaptation is mainly a cleverly designed solo skinner box for watching numbers go up as players accrue wealth and real estate. Scopely, which also operates <em>Marvel Strike Force</em> and <em>Star Fleet Strike Command</em>, was purchased by Savvy back in 2023 for nearly $5 billion as the investment company becomes a growing player in the world of games. </p><p>Despite <em>Pokémon Go</em> becoming a household name since its launch back in 2016, Niantic, which grew out of an internal Google startup, has struggled to replicate that success across other franchises and genres. <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em> arrived in 2019 and shut down just a few years later, while <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, despite being fun mobile games, never took off in the same way. It’s unclear what would happen with those under Savvy management. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
