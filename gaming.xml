While news of <em>Legends: Z-A</em> was very welcome, what was not mentioned—nor ever rumored to be mentioned—was Pokémon’s next mainline entry. And yet, based on the pattern of the last decade-and-a-half, this should have been the day we learned of a new core title in the world’s most popular franchise, and got our first few hints about a whole new generation of pocket monsters.

Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire.

You probably have your own definition and exceptions. And as you might expect, nearly everyone at <em>Kotaku </em>has thoughts and opinions on what is and isn’t an RPG.

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>.

<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>

Survivors of many battles, they pose the biggest threat once you've reached the endgame portion of the campaign.

Here's a quick summary:</p><ul><li>Chapter 3-5: Monster Hunter is the conclusion of the story proper.</li><li>When you're done with the story, quests become more free-form. You simply need to take out targets and complete quests so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</li><li>Upon reaching Hunter Rank 20, you're given the Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns mission, which takes you back to the Ruins of Wyveria.</li><li>This leads you to a battle against a Lala Barina that you're tracking, as well as a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, the first Tempered Monster type that you encounter.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184"></a><figcaption>Tempered Monsters are scarred veterans of countless battles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_track_down_Tempered_Monsters">How to track down Tempered Monsters</h3><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Tempered Monsters offer the most difficult bouts in the game. These creatures are battle-hardened, as you can see by the scars and old wounds on their bodies. They're tougher compared to normal variants, so don't underestimate them.</p><p>If you plan on tracking down a Tempered Monster, you can do so by opening the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/monster-hunter-wilds-world-map-biomes-regions/2900-6290/" data-ref-id="2900-6290"><strong>world map biomes</strong></a> to see which ones are currently active in a particular location. You'll also notice that a blue glow/waypoint leads you to these targets, as opposed to the green-colored trails for other creatures or items.</p><h3 id="Tempered_Monster_materials">Tempered Monster materials</h3><p>The reason why you want to eliminate Tempered Monsters whenever you see them is because they grant the usual loot from their species, as well as endgame materials. These are used to craft Artian Weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds--i.e. rank 6, 7, and 8 (currently the highest tier in the game).</p><p>Once you've collected enough materials, talk to Gemma at your base and select the Forge Artian Weapons option. You'll notice some key differences here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186"></a><figcaption>Combine parts to come up with an Artian Weapon with a certain elemental property or status ailment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_craft_Artian_Weapons">How to craft Artian Weapons</h3><p>The process of crafting Artian Weapons is vastly different compared to Low Rank or High Rank armaments. This time, you need to select three parts to develop a viable combination. Here are a few reminders:</p><ul><li>You may only select parts that have the same rarity--i.e. rank 6, 7, or 8.</li><li>Parts have an elemental property or a status ailment property.</li><li>If you pick two or more materials with the same properties, the weapon gains that effect. If all three materials have different properties, then the result will be a non-elemental gear piece.</li><li>Example: 2x Thunder and 1x Sleep results in a weapon with the Thunder element. However, if you pick 1x Thunder, 1x Sleep, and 1x Dragon, then the combination would yield a non-elemental result.</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that weapon categories require different part classifications:</p><ul><li>Great Sword - Requires 2x blade and 1x tube.</li><li>Long Sword - Requires 1x blade and 2x tube.</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x disc.</li><li>Dual Blades - Requires 2x blade and 1x disc.</li><li>Hammer - Requires 2x disc and 1x tube.</li><li>Hunting Horn - Requires 1x disc and 2x device.</li><li>Lance - Requires 1x blade and 2x disc.</li><li>Gunlance - Requires 2x disc and 1x device.</li><li>Switch Axe - Requires 2x blade and 1x device.</li><li>Charge Blade - Requires 1x blade, 1x disc, and 1x device.</li><li>Insect Glaive - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Light Bowgun - Requires 1x tube and 2x device.</li><li>Heavy Bowgun - Requires 1x disc, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Bow - Requires 2x tube and 1x device.</li></ul><p>That does it for our Monster Hunter Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons guide. Once you've crafted a couple of these high-end armaments, keep eliminating tougher creatures so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</p><p>Soon, rarer and more difficult Tempered Monsters will appear. Of course, this also means that you'll be able to create rank 7 and, eventually, rank 8 gear pieces.</p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

            <p>Once Human's cross-platform test for PC and mobile is now live.</p>
<p>Running from now until 30th March, players in Europe, Japan, and North America are able to jump into NetEase's free-to-play PvPvE sandbox action horror before the mobile port - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">back in September</a> - launches in April 2025 and test the "seamless" cross-progression features across PC and mobile.</p>

<p>"Once Human's cross-platform test uses the current global server environment that's being used by the PC version of the game," NetEase explains. "This means that all of the content from the PC version, including all the Scenarios and the Visional Wheel/Lunar Oracle, can be experienced by mobile players throughout the test."</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671570/Out_and_About/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> has all the bright colors and cheerful local people you’d expect of the genre, but the core of the game is surprisingly realistic, asking you to correctly identify various real-life plants.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Out and About - Short Steam Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lqJUUH76B8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At the start of the demo, a storm destroys the town where you’re visiting your grandmother. On your way from your campsite you meet the local forager, who tasks you with finding plants to heal an injured resident. Developer Yaldi Games says the game contains over 100 real-world plants; each one you find grows next to one that looks very similar. Some of these similarities are no big deal–the consequences of mixing up chamomile and daisy are fairly minor–but others have toxic lookalikes, like hemlock and yarrow.</p><p>The plant identification mini-game is pretty simple: after taking a photo of your finds (<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alas</a>), you’re given two cards with clues to each plant’s identity. Verifying which plant is which involves clicking around on the plant until you check the various details listed on the card. Then, you can harvest the plant, taking care not to take too much of its flowers and leaves. You’re also tasked with sorting the plants you’ve collected, which presents a slightly harder identification game that only gives you bits of cuttings and less clues. None of it is too taxing, but I really enjoyed studying the game’s renditions of real plants and learning about their uses.</p><p>You use the plants you’ve gathered to craft–in the demo, you make a stinging nettle soup, a green I’ve sometimes seen at the farmer’s market and never understood why people buy, and which I am now really curious to use; thanks, video games! You sell the stuff you craft at the local market, where customers come to you with various needs that can be met by your snacks, balms, and medicines. Again, it’s not too hard, but it’s fun to think about what might be best for the townsfolk from your stock. Yaldi writes that “All 150+ recipes in the game are real, and we'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to make them at home,” which sounds very cool. (The game also opens with a giant-font warning that it is not a guide to real-life foraging, which feels like a very necessary caveat.)</p><p>Aesthetically, <em>Out and About</em> looks like the kind of game I tend to find a little too twee, but your mileage will vary there given your own personal tastes. In a press release, Yaldi described itself as having "a mission to craft hobby games infused with real, actionable knowledge that enriches players' lives." I’m intrigued by that claim to fidelity and really enjoyed what I experienced of it in the demo. The full game is set to release later this year.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO announced earlier this year that we'd be getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-movie-lego-sets-gives-insight-into-which-mobs-will-appear-in-the-jack-black-film">new Minecraft Movie sets</a>, and the time has finally come for them to be released into the world. There are four new Minecraft sets that you can now buy, with two of them featuring scenes from the upcoming film. These new sets are added to an ever-growing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">list of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> that have been accumulating over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the new Minecraft Movie sets features minifigure mobs, but only two of the sets offer up a tiny Jack Black as Steve. You can currently purchase all of these sets from Amazon, LEGO direct, or any of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New LEGO Minecraft Sets Available Now</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are four new LEGO Minecraft sets coming out, the two that are associated with the movie are The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both sets give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming film. The Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring depicts some sort of gladiator style battle with Jason Momoa fighting a baby zombie on a chicken. Meanwhile the Ghast Balloon Village Attack set reveals a marshamallow-like villain from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Nether">Nether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two Minecraft sets that are releasing are The Parrot Houses and The Trial Chamber. For more like these, you can check out more of our favorite LEGO Minecraft sets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Does the New Minecraft Movie Come Out?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO tends to release new sets tied to movie releases about a month before the actual release of the film. The new Minecraft sets are following the same timeline by coming out on March 1 seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft movie</a> is hitting theaters on April 4, 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will There Be More Minecraft Movie Sets?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So far the two sets we've featured above are the only ones set to release alongside the film. It's possible this could change if the live-action Minecraft movie is a success. Either way, there are new LEGO Minecraft sets released fairly consistently and we can likely expect more to release later this year, even if it isn't directly tied to the movie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/621706/sayonara-wild-hearts-ps5-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Of all of my favorite games, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> might be the hardest to describe. It’s a rhythm game, but also you ride on a motorcycle and a dragon, wield giant swords while dodging fireballs, and teleport to a retrofuturistic VR world. It’s structured like a pop album, telling a story of love and loss, and is narrated by Queen Latifah. It’s <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> meets <em>R-Type</em> crossed with <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> as directed by Carly Rae Jepsen. It makes sense once you play it, trust me.</p><p>This was all true <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo">when the game first launched in 2019 on the Switch and PS4</a> (it was also on Apple Arcade, but has since been removed). But now is a good time to check it out if you haven’t. The game just launched on the PS5 — it’s a free upgrade if you have it on PS4 — which adds some performance improvements and a new endless mode called remix arcade that you can read more about <a href="https://simogo.com/work/sayonara-wild-hearts/sayonara-wild-hearts-remix-arcade/">here</a>. Really, though, the new platform is just an excellent excuse to dive back into this world.</p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> follows the story of a young heartbroken woman who is transported to an alternate realm where she must restore harmony by collecting lots of hearts. To do this, you play through a series of 23 short levels, doing everything from racing through city streets to fighting biker gangs to flying amid the ruins of a destroyed city. It’s an arcade-style game, where you’re racing through levels in search of a high score (which you get by collecting hearts and other items), and most of what you’re doing is in time to the beat of the dreamy pop music that plays throughout.</p><p>The game only lasts around two hours, but it packs so much into that space. What you’re doing is <em>constantly</em> changing. Vehicles shift from skateboards to motorcycles to cars to human flight to dragons, and there are about a half dozen different styles of games, from old-school arcade shooters to early 3D platformers to racing games. Almost all of those genres are then filtered through the lens of rhythm action, for a twitchy experience that feels very cohesive. It’s also pretty approachable. If you keep failing a section — like me during any of the first-person driving sequences — you have the option to simply skip it and move on.</p><p>Just as important, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> is incredibly stylish. The dream world is slick and beautiful, rendered in pinks, blues, and purples, with characters that dance as they fight and, uh, mechs made out of robotic wolves. It’s as weird as it is cool, and it’s carried by an incredible pop soundtrack from composers Daniel Olsén and Jonathan Eng, alongside vocalist Linnea Olsson. It’s all bangers, and I’m listening to it right now as I write this story.</p><p>Just like a great album, <em>Sayonara</em> is something I find myself coming back to again and again. I’ve replayed it several times over the last six years, and each time, I’ve been struck by just how bold it is. Those feelings haven’t been diminished over time. It helps that it’s just the right length so you can easily soak it all in.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> before, you might be surprised to learn that it comes from Simogo, the same Swedish studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam">last year’s cryptic noir puzzler <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a>. If you <em>have</em> heard of Simogo, well, then nothing will really surprise you. The studio’s games have covered everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">folklore horror</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">audio dramas</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report">interactive spy novels</a>. It’s an eclectic lineup, but also one that’s impressively consistent and inventive, and <em>Sayonara</em> might just be the team at the height of its creativity.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The beefy Windows gaming tablet is back, and it’s done two things I thought impossible. It made me respect integrated graphics, and it convinced me a Windows tablet can be fun. </p><p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/">Asus ROG Flow Z13</a> is a 13-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard, a bright screen, and the guts of a gaming laptop. I knew it was something special when I used a clamp-on controller to turn a preproduction model into some kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">superpowered, supersized Steam Deck</a>. In daily use, it’s more like a husky <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review">Surface Pro</a>, with an AMD Strix Halo processor featuring powerful integrated graphics for gaming and a battery that lasts a full workday in non-gaming tasks. It’s a charming and versatile device that could plausibly replace a desktop, laptop, <em>and</em> a tablet or handheld for a certain type of PC gamer — one who doesn’t mind the $2,100 starting price.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2100</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Impressive game performance for an iGPU on a tablet</li><li>Capable 2.5K performance</li><li>Laptop-quality keyboard and trackpad</li><li>Battery can get through a day of work (with no gaming breaks)</li><li>Play games on your lap without heating up your legs</li><li>Excellent kickstand</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Still a pricey, niche device</li><li>Wish the keyboard cover had Bluetooth like the latest Surface Pro</li><li>Power / sleep button is too flush</li><li>No auto-brightness</li><li>Keyboard case sometimes not detected after waking from sleep</li><li>Single-zone keyboard RGB looks basic</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The ROG Flow Z13 is a tablet that’s also trying to be a hardcore gaming machine. It has a 13.4-inch, 180Hz IPS touchscreen with pen support, 32GB of unified memory (up to 128GB), a 1TB m.2 SSD, and ample port selection, starting at $2,099.99. The Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 APU in our $2,299.99 review unit offers surprisingly good gaming performance, especially for a <em>tablet</em>. And the detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and trackpad feels like it’s pulled directly from the excellent ROG Zephyrus laptops. It makes for a potent portable gaming device — one you can even use on your lap without your legs burning up. </p><p>I used it keyboardless on the couch for a Discord movie and game night with some buds, and it left enough space on my lap for my cat to curl up. I stuck it on my desk, between my giant 4K monitor and my mechanical keyboard, and it doubled as my desktop computer and a handy secondary screen. I even plugged it into my TV like a game console — one with much better graphics than any docked handheld. The ability to do all these things makes it a lot of fun.</p><div id=":R32rarr6:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>It’s a great second screen to a large monitor.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Or a console for a giant TV.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>But it’s coziest when chilling on your lap around the house.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The Flow Z13’s Strix Halo processor is very capable in graphics-heavy games at its native 2560 x 1600-inch resolution. Don’t expect extras like path tracing, but <em>do </em>expect solid framerates in the 50 to 60-plus fps range on low-to-medium settings. In games that support FSR 3 and frame generation, you can push things further: with those scaling options enabled, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>hit over 60fps and even pushed into the 70s at high settings on a 4K external monitor.</p><p>I’ve also played a bunch of <em>Elden Ring </em>on the Z13. (I blame the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Nightreign</em> network test</a> for giving me the itch again.) At native resolution, it was consistently in the 50fps range on high settings, and at 1200p, it hit the game’s 60fps ceiling. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22989540/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-windows-specs-review">first Z13, back in 2022</a>, could barely muster 30fps at 1200p on medium settings in the Lands Between. That wasn’t far off from the much cheaper and less powerful Steam Deck, which tops out around 40fps at 800p and medium settings, with plenty of framerate dips. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em> remains <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed" rel="sponsored">one of the most-played titles</a> on Valve’s $400 handheld. But it’s <em>so much </em>better on the new ROG Flow, and the delta between the Z13 and the Steam Deck is now much wider. You can even play for around 90 minutes on battery on the Z13, as opposed to 70 minutes on the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck is cheaper and comfier to use, but it’s also another device to keep track of. The Z13’s detachable keyboard gives it some of the play-anywhere benefit of the Steam Deck while still being good for other things. If the Z13 just had dedicated controllers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">like I tried to adapt</a>, it’d be like a Super Steam Deck.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The screen isn’t OLED, but it’s a great looking 180Hz IPS panel.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The design is fun and gamer-y without feeling edgelord.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>This is the first device of any kind we’ve tested that uses AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">Strix Halo</a> processors, which combine speedy CPU cores like the ones on AMD’s Strix Point processors with AMD’s most powerful integrated graphics cores. It also gives this Z13 much better battery life than previous models. It lasted a very respectable 10 hours in our battery rundown test, and I could get through an eight to nine-hour workday if I wasn’t reckless (no games, around 200 to 300 nits brightness, power efficiency mode, and battery saver at 30 percent). The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23660652/asus-rog-flow-z13-acronym-gaming-laptop-tablet-review">last Flow Z13 we tested</a>, in 2023, with an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU and Nvidia RTX 4070 mobile GPU, lasted around four and a half hours in regular use and just 48 minutes while gaming. </p><div><h2>Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Laptops</h3></th><th><h3>GPU</h3></th><th><h3>Geekbench 6 single-core</h3></th><th><h3>Geekbench 6 multicore</h3></th><th><h3>Geekbench 6 GPU</h3></th><th><h3>Cinebench 2024 single-core</h3></th><th><h3>Cinebench 2024 multicore</h3></th><th><h3>3DMark Time Spy (1440p)</h3></th><th><h3>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (QHD+)</h3></th><th><h3>Cyberpunk 2077 (Ultra, no RT, FHD+)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asus ROG Flow Z13 (AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395)</td><td>AMD Radeon 8060S</td><td>2986</td><td>19845</td><td>80819</td><td>116</td><td>1450</td><td>9034</td><td>63</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Asus Zenbook S 16 (AMD Ryzen AI 9 370HX)</td><td>AMD Radeon 890M</td><td>2828</td><td>13565</td><td>35991</td><td>113</td><td>998</td><td>3335</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td></tr><tr><td>Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (AMD Ryzen AI 9 370HX)</td><td>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070</td><td>2901</td><td>15462</td><td>113434</td><td>117</td><td>1218</td><td>12208</td><td>95</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS)</td><td>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060</td><td>2583</td><td>12335</td><td>Not tested</td><td>104</td><td>940</td><td>9767</td><td>64</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Dell XPS 14 (Intel Core Ultra 7 155H)</td><td>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050</td><td>2340</td><td>13118</td><td>32661</td><td>102</td><td>676</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td></tr><tr><td>Razer Blade 16 (Intel Core i9-14900HX)</td><td>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</td><td>2922</td><td>17606</td><td>187733</td><td>125</td><td>1505</td><td>Not tested</td><td>Not tested</td><td>90</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In our benchmarks, the Z13’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395</a> beats the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">Asus Zenbook S 16</a> (a productivity laptop) and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Zephyrus G16</a> (a gaming laptop) — and pretty much any Intel chip we’ve seen in a laptop recently — in single-core and multi-core CPU tests. And the 40-core Radeon 8060S is astonishingly powerful for an integrated GPU, rivalling Nvidia’s RTX 4060. The RTX 4070 in the Zephyrus G16 still handily wins in GPU performance by 40-55 percent in Geekbench and 3DMark Time Spy, but Strix Halo proves formidable. And allow me to emphasize once more: <em>integrated graphics</em>.</p><p>To get that performance on the Z13, you’ll have to pony up $2,299.99 for the configuration with the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html">Ryzen AI Max Plus 395</a>. That’s $200 more than the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-390.html">AI Max 390</a> chip in the base model, but according to YouTuber Cary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePhawx">“The Phawx”</a> Golomb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiHr8CQRZi4">hourlong deep dive</a> into both versions of the Z13, the upgrade, which gets you four more CPU cores and eight more GPU cores, is worth the money. </p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2><strong>Component report card:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Rear-facing camera:</strong> D</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic: </strong>C</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Touchpad:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 2 (one on the kickstand and one hidden beneath)</span></li></ul></div></div><p>All configurations of the Z13 are 0.51 inches thick and 2.65 pounds without the keyboard, which adds 0.86 pounds. By comparison, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review">Surface Pro</a> 11 is 0.68 inches thick and 2.7 pounds with the keyboard. Asus’s upcoming 2025 <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/wtb/">ROG Zephyrus G14</a> will be 0.63 inches thick and 3.46 pounds, which is slightly lighter and thinner than the chonky-for-a-tablet Z13. Hefty as the Z13 is, its compact size and rigid build make it feel more portable and knockaround-friendly than you’d expect. The sturdy kickstand really helps when toting it around the house or repositioning it, since you can stick your hands under it and lift with support from your forearms, as opposed to just your fingers. It’s still best thought of as a gaming laptop with a detachable keyboard, but it’s surprising how much more flexible that makes it. </p><p>The Z13 also has a 5-megapixel webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. You’d have to be deranged to take actual pictures with the rear camera on a Windows tablet; it’s mostly useful for showing people things on video calls. The dual speakers are workable but don’t offer a particularly full sound, especially at the low end, and you may accidentally block one when holding it in landscape orientation. And the chunky 200W power adapter uses Asus’ reversible proprietary connector (it supports 100W Power Delivery via its USB-C 4 ports, as well).</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</strong><span><figcaption><em>Just for fun, here’s the Z13 and an older 13-inch iPad Pro. The Asus is certainly a chonk by comparison.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a tablet that makes a plausible gaming laptop and even desktop, the ROG Flow Z13 is as close to an all-in-one device as there is right now. And like any all-in-one, it’s expensive and it makes some compromises compared to more traditional devices — price being the most obvious. You can spend less money on a more powerful (and even more compact) gaming laptop like the Zephyrus G14, or you can go the other way and get a desktop and a Steam Deck. But there’s something about the Flow that’s charming and joyful<strong>.</strong> If it weren’t quite so expensive, I’d be tempted to buy it instead of a traditional gaming laptop and handheld.</p><p>The Strix Halo chip inside the Z13 may end up being a bigger deal than the tablet itself. That’s already evidenced by its implementation in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/619605/framework-desktop-preview-hands-on">Framework’s endearing little Desktop</a> and more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339771/i-lifted-128gb-of-memory-and-the-most-powerful-integrated-graphics-with-one-hand">traditional laptops</a> on their way. But, for now, this intriguing chip takes one of the quirkiest and coolest tablet-laptop hybrids and makes it more powerful, more efficient, and a lot more compelling.</p><div><div><p id="asus-rog-flow-z13-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>Asus ROG Flow Z13 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>13.4-inch (2560 x 1600) 180Hz IPS touchscreen, 500 nits</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 (16 cores, up to 5.1 GHz)</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> AMD Radeon 8060S (40 cores)</span></li><li><span><strong>Unified memory:</strong> 32GB LPDDR5X</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe 4.0 (2230)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 5MP front, 13MP rear, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x USB 4 (Type-C) with Power Delivery / DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type-A), HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm combo audio jack, microSD card slot (UHS-II)</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.65 pounds (3.5 pounds with keyboard)</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.81 x 8.03 x 0.51 inches (0.59 inches with keyboard)</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 70Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Power adapter:</strong> 200W, proprietary connector</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $2,299.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Star Wars: Republic Commando is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 1, 2025. Below, we look at how its focus on military fiction was a sign of things to come to the Star Wars galaxy .</em></p><p dir="ltr">When you boot up Star Wars: Republic Commando, the first thing you see is the LucasArts logo, fuzzy like a jammed radio signal. It flickers with the audio of muttered orders, of droid speak. This is an idea taken from the original Clone Wars cartoons (starting in 2003), which also opens with a distorted broadcast, in that case of blaster fire and blaring lightsabers. In tandem, these aesthetic flourishes represent a turn away from the science fantasy mythicism of Star Wars proper and a turn toward a grittier, though still exaggerated, military fiction.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, it is not as if these impulses were not in Star Wars to begin with. Though A New Hope draws on the science fiction golden age idealism of Flash Gordan serials, it is a worn down future. Our heroes are would-be guerrilla militants, piloting buckets of bolts. Their fascist enemies reserve any futurist slickness. The fight of rebels is scrappy, hidden in trees and sequestered in backwater planets.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are not ordinary soldiers, but heroes (nomenclature used by a Star Wars video game contemporary to Republic Commando: Battlefront 2). The original trilogy, and to a large extent the prequels, take a similar position to war as The Lord of the Rings. Epic battles often take the forefront, and both franchises are undoubtedly concerned with war. But the heroes are not boots-on-the-ground infantry or even military commanders exactly, but kings and prodigal children. They save the world, while rebels and fascists alike die in the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando represents something more mundane: the everyday life of a soldier at war. The game's obvious principle inspiration, outside of Star Wars itself, is Halo. Like that FPS, Republic Commando goes to great pains to make its titular characters special boys, a cut above the ordinary clones who make up the rest of the Galactic Republic's army. But also, the commandos can't get up to anything too earth-shattering or else interfere with the films their game ties in with. In practical terms, the plot of Star Wars itself would not change if every one of the commandos died in a ditch. The effect is like a bit of propaganda: You are the heroes that preserve the republic, although in actuality, you are just more bodies to line the future Emperor's checkbook.</p><div tabindex="0"

Even though it was released before Episode III revealed the looming threat of Order 66, the clone troopers were still destined to become the Empire's stormtroopers. (Yes, I'm aware the Empire swaps to a more standard military recruitment strategy in its early days. To this criticism I have just one response: Shut up, nerd.) At game's end, the commandos suffer a senseless loss of their sniper, Sev, only for their Jedi commanders to order them to a new position, forcing the squad to leave their teammate behind. This is not the loss of some pawn with the same visage and personality as every one of his brothers. This is an individual loss of someone with a soul of his own, however cliched or simplistic.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this neatly anticipates Dave Filoni's The Clone Wars show, which grants whole platoons and battalions the same attention this game provided an elite squad. The game's commandos even appear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3wpkCt2Ms">one episode</a>, but they also are predecessors to many of The Clone Wars' original characters, especially The Bad Batch, who were first conceptualized before the series' cancelation on Cartoon Network but re-appeared as part of the series' revitalization on Disney+ and then on their own spin-off show. Like the commandos, the Bad Batch are a squad of specialized personalities defined by their skill in battle. The Bad Batch are not the first of such characters to appear in The Clone Wars, but are a small unit, defined by their relationships to each other, in a way that echoes Republic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">But The Clone Wars' sense of wartime tragedy is even more heightened. The Battle of Umbara arc follows Anakin Skywalker's 501st clone battalion after he is called away on a special mission. The general who replaces him pushes the clones toward senseless losses for a secret agenda. The whole thing is the plight of the clones in miniature. They are all dying for a cause they are incapable of actually choosing, that demands they turn against their friends and comrades with the flick of a switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The show's final run on Disney+ pushes this to its logical conclusion, dramatizing Order 66 itself. Anakin's apprentice, Ahsoka, watches her friends turn on her and she saves her mentor, Captain Rex, but the rest of the clones accompanying her die in the encounter. This could be the substance of a Metal Gear Solid backstory, as it explores the same issues: duty to your loyalties vs. the substance of your conscience, love on the battlefield or a bullet in the gut. The plight of the clone is the plight of the idealized, fictional, unreal soldier.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando is hardly a serious engagement with these themes, but it's all there in uniformed shadows. Its influence is felt across the next 20 years of Star Wars, from the sometimes strict military fiction of Clone Wars to the guerrilla warfare drama of Andor to Dave Filoni's partial stewardship of the franchise (though I'll believe that Mandalorian movie is happening when I am in the theater watching it). All these examples share the same sorts of dead ends. No matter how Republic Commandos dressed itself up in blaster fire and Halo-style heroics, all that awaits its heroes is death. That's as true for them as it is for Captain Rex as it is for Andor or Anakin Skywalker.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-wait-for-fable-play-fable-2-instead<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Buried like some kind of cursed treasure at the bottom of this week’s episode of the official Xbox Podcast was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay">news about Playground Games’ long-awaited Fable</a>. I call it “treasure” because it included a rare glimpse at gameplay, but “cursed” because it came with that dreaded caveat that accompanies so many development updates: a delay. Once planned to launch this year, Fable is now set for a 2026 release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delays, of course, are generally not harbingers of doom, despite the agonising wait they inflict. In Fable’s case, hopefully this is the sign of a richly detailed world that just needs more time to bloom. But that extra year of waiting can be put to good use: there’s no better time to play the Fable games. Specifically, I’d urge you to try Fable 2, the series’ highpoint, and (re)discover just what a strange and unique RPG Lionhead Studios’ 2008 classic is. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By today’s role-playing game standards, Fable 2 is really quite unusual. But even compared to its 2008 contemporaries, which includes the likes of Fallout 3 (released just days later) and BioWare’s early 3D games, it is practically singular in its vision. While Fable 2 features a fairly traditional campaign structure, with a linear main story and an esoteric collection of optional side quests, its RPG systems are a far cry from the crunchy stat blocks of Oblivion and Neverwinter Nights. It completely smooths out those aspects to create something incredibly approachable, even for those who find a D&amp;D character sheet indistinguishable from hieroglyphics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just six main skills govern the likes of your health pool, strength, and speed. There’s only a single damage stat to consider when it comes to weapons, and nothing of the sort when it comes to armour or buff-providing accessories. Combat, despite being prevalent throughout most quests, is incredibly surface swashbuckling, spiced up only through the use of some genuinely creative spellcasting (including the wonderful Chaos, which forces enemies to dance and scrub the floors.) You’re even imperious to death – losing all your hitpoints is punished with nothing more than a minor XP penalty. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fable 2 is the RPG for people who have never played RPGs before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Fable 2 is the RPG for people who have never played RPGs before. Back in 2008, when Oblivion’s open world Cyrodiil may have felt overwhelmingly huge and imposingly freeform for role-playing newbies, Fable 2’s Albion offered a more manageable chain of small, easy-to-navigate maps. You can freely go back and forth between these areas and, with the aid of your faithful canine companion who barks at the merest sign of adventure, you can tread beyond the beaten path to discover secrets like buried treasure, sunken caves, and the puzzle-posing Demon Doors. All this lends the world a sense of scale and opportunity grander than its actual footprint. But Albion’s geography is restrictive, largely forcing you down linear pathways from one landmark to another. This isn’t a world to get lost in, at least not in the traditional sense of the word.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albion as a physical entity pales in comparison to the incredible worlds of BioWare’s Infinity Engine games and Bethesda’s wonderfully weird Morrowind. But to judge it on both modern and contemporary expectations of RPGs is to do it a disservice. Fable 2’s priorities lie not in climbing far-off mountains or spelunking through dungeons with a myriad of routes, but in a world that is bustling with life. Look at Fable 2 through the lens of a very different game – Maxis’ similarly singular The Sims – and you’ll find a truly remarkable simulation of society.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/fable-2-town-1740756088967.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The town of Bowerstone is full of simulated, authentic life. | Image credit: Lionhead Studios / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Albion operates like some kind of strange organic clockwork organism. Every morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, its people wake and start their daily routines. Town criers bellow updates over the noisy crowds: “Shops are now opening!” and, when the stars begin to twinkle once more, “The time is: very late!” Much like your families in The Sims, every citizen of Albion has an interior life, driven by not just their societal roles, but also their likes and dislikes. Through the use of an ever-expanding library of gestures, you can delight, insult, impress, or even seduce every (non-hostile) person you encounter. A well-executed fart may have the patrons of a pub howling into their beers, while pointing and laughing at small children may send them fleeing for their parents. Through these emotes you can push and pull the people of Albion, charming them with your heroism and eccentricities, or pushing them away with your evil deeds and rudeness. We often talk about reactive NPCs and video game cities that feel alive, but there’s simply nothing out there that achieves those goals in quite the same way as Fable 2.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your character is a Hero with a capital H, destined to go on grand adventures, bully bandits, and find glittering treasure, Fable 2 is a more interesting game when you fully assimilate yourself into its society. Pretty much every building in Albion is available for purchase, both houses and shops, and you can buy them with the money earned by toiling away at gainful employment (the woodcutting and blacksmithing minigames quickly become monotonous-yet-soothing distractions.) With the keys to a house in hand, you can either become a landlord, renting the property out for fair or extortionate prices, or make the building your home and furnish it to your tastes. Then there’s the next step: wooing the most attractive NPC in town by repeatedly spamming their favourite emote until they fall into your bed and, after a comedic bit of slap and tickle, you end up with a baby. The individual components of all this, as with The Sims, feels incredibly artificial. Yet the overall result produces a genuine, remarkable sense of life. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A well-executed fart may have the patrons of a pub howling into their beers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Few, if any, RPGs have followed in Fable’s footsteps in this department. Even the towering achievements of Baldur’s Gate 3 don’t include organic romances and the ability to game the property market. But Albion’s authentic sense of life does exist in a more unexpected successor: Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar’s digital recreation of the old West is incredibly responsive, filled with incidental characters that believably react to your presence and behaviour. Every single NPC can be spoken to using a system that feels like a slicker, more cinematic version of Fable 2’s gestures, and your demeanor can delight or annoy. While most interactions are simple pleasantries, the lives you touch in more meaningful ways – such as sucking the venom out of a lethal snake bite – may remember you and repay you with kindness many weeks later. If Playground’s new Fable is to stay true to its origins, then its modern touchstone should be Rockstar’s unparalleled living world rather than the tabletop-inspired RPGs that are currently in vogue.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other mandatory things Playground will need to foster, too. Fable’s incredibly British sense of humour needs to be maintained, and so we’d best be seeing some dry, witty satire of the class system with a healthy dose of bum jokes on the side. Plus we’ll need a cast of beloved thespians that rival the teaching staff of Hogwarts (something Playground already seems to have under control, with Richard Ayoade and Matt King appearing in trailers.) But perhaps the most important, beyond that bustling world, is Lionhead’s trademark approach to good and evil. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/fable-2-forest-troll-1740756268280.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fable 2's combat is simple, but its enemy designs are gorgeous reinterpretations of fantasy staples. | Image credit: Lionhead Studios / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Peter Molyneux, the founder of Lionhead Studios and lead designer of the Fable series, has a fascination with good and evil. Providing players a choice between the two was the basis of the studio’s first project, the god game Black &amp; White, and continued to be a focus throughout the rest of Molyneux’s career, including his upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024">Masters of Albion</a> (which is unrelated to Fable, despite its confusing name.) But Lionhead’s approach to player choice is a far cry from the nuanced, tough decisions featured in The Witcher and the best works of BioWare. In Fable 2, your options are either absolutely angelic or despicably demonic, with no grey space in between. It works in comedic extremes; an early sidequest asks you to either clear the pests out of a trader’s warehouse or destroy all his stock. Later, a ghost who killed himself after being abandoned at the altar asks that you torment his still-living former lover, and your only paths are to make her life a living hell or make her your wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past decade and change of RPG development has placed priority on ultimate player expression, unlocked through choices that explore a spectrum of human behaviour. Moral quandaries, we’ve decided, should be much more complicated than the choice between saving children or burning them alive. Fable, though, thrives on the binary. It relishes the chance for you to play the most heroic hero the land ever saw, or become the most heinous villain in history. This was established in the trilogy’s first game, which saw your character literally grow devil horns if you persistently chose evil options, but really came into its own in Fable 2. The way the sequel’s quests branch to offer good or evil pathways feels richer and more creative, while that reactive world allows both your moment-to-moment and week-to-week activities to shape your reputation and purity alignment. Moral-focused outcomes in RPGs can often feel underwhelming because they place increased resources on the centre rather than the extremes, and so being truly evil ultimately feels like saving the world with a scowl. Fable 2, on the other hand, is happy for you to go full Sith (with the lightning powers to match) and it largely works because it only has two paths to juggle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not yet clear if Playground Games will get this side of Fable right. While this week’s development update came with 50 seconds of pre-alpha gameplay footage, there was little in there that truly painted the picture of an authentic Fable game. Well, aside from the mandatory chicken kick, of course. But under a minute of contextless footage was never going to tell the whole story, was it? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we can see in those fleeting seconds is a much more detailed world than Fable has ever enjoyed. The main character’s horse points to an open world with far fewer restrictions than the 360-era games, and an incredibly rendered forest suggests that we genuinely will be able to get lost in this new Albion. But it's the brief shot of a city, which looks dense and knotty and full of life, that gives me hope that Playground Games have stuck true to the Sims-like simulation of society that makes Fable 2 so unique. I can’t wait to point and laugh at its children, dance on its pubs’ tables, and have a whirlwind romance with a randomer I meet behind the green grocers.        </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all of that is a year away. And in that time you can revisit (or experience for the first time) the wonderful world of Fable 2. You’ll easily see why it’s so beloved, and why it’s so important that Playground Games retains all of its oddities. Because what we don’t need from this project is a Fable reimagined as a Witcher clone, or as a Baldur’s Gate-alike, or Dragon Age style RPG. We just need Fable to be Fable, farts and all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty boasts one of the most popular esports ecosystems in the business. From the Call of Duty League to Challengers, and from the Esports World Cup to the many grassroots events that pop up every year, the competitive scene has plenty of meat on the bones. Many players front the esports landscape, but which of them can be considered the best Call of Duty players around?</p>



<p>In this breakdown, I’ll highlight the top COD pro players you should be watching this year. It’s an ever-changing scene, but the top dogs are usually the same year in, year out – at least until they retire, that is.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about the ten best Call of Duty players in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-best-cod-players">Who Are The Best COD Players?</h2>



<p>As a preface, I’ll highlight that I’m talking <strong>only </strong>about players in the Call of Duty League in this guide. This list won’t touch on the best Warzone players in the business. I’m all about the CDL in this piece!</p>



<p><strong>In no particular order</strong>, let’s talk about the best Call of Duty players in the game <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chris-simp-lehr">Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Simp is a tried and tested competitor with some of the most stunning achievements in the scene. He was a prodigy who started competing from a young age, breaking into the CWL in 2019 and winning the COD Championship as one of the freshest faces ever to do it.</p>



<p>He went on to win another ring in 2021 after one of the most incredible seasons in the business, showing remarkable domination through the Cold War year. He has flown the Atlanta FaZe banner proudly since 2019 and is one of the most recognisable forces in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Simp’s talents on the sticks are second to none. Time and again, he proves himself to be one of the most technically proficient players in the game, and despite his relatively quiet demeanour, he’s an utter animal with some of the best thumbs in esports.</p>



<p>In 2025, Simp has already claimed a Major chip and a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<h3 id="h-thomas-scrappy-ernst">Thomas ‘Scrappy’ Ernst</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$507,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Scrap entered the Call of Duty League scene as one of the most electrifying, controversial rookies, going on a crusade against some of the biggest and most beloved veterans in the business. The loudmouthed competitor could back up his bark with his bite, though. He quickly established himself as one of the straightest shooters in the game.</p>



<p>In his opening season with Toronto Ultra, Scrap claimed a Major chip and came close to netting a world championship title but was stopped in his tracks by the New York Subliners. Since then, Scrap has earned another chip and wound up in third place at his second COD Champs event.</p>



<p>In 2025, Ernst finds himself occupying a spot on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/">the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’</a>, and he’s already flying in Black Ops 6. He fell ever so slightly short of first place at Major I but has already proven himself as one of the most dominating players and a budding IGL in the 2025 CDL season.</p>



<p>It helps that he has mellowed a bit, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-mcarthur-cellium-jovel">McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.6 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Cellium lives and breathes competitive Call of Duty. As one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, Cellium is the epitome of talent on the sticks, and everything from his movement to his accuracy is top-notch.</p>



<p>Alongside Simp, Cellium has won a COD Champs ring, the top prize at the inaugural Esports World Cup, and has claimed several chips over the last few years. He’s a beloved character with a quirky personality, and his skills are almost unparalleled. </p>



<p>Cellium started strong in 2025, netting a win <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/">at the first Major in Madrid</a> <strong>and </strong>the CDL Minor I tournament. With multiple spots as an MVP and an All-Star, Cellium has a stellar record and even more potential to land another ring in the future – perhaps in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro">Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>In 2024, Shotzzy went on a burner along with the rest of OpTic Texas, netting a win at Major III and then securing a massive victory at COD Champs, beating the New York Subliners with a 5 – 1 scoreline. That earned Shotzzy his second ring in Call of Duty, following on from his 2020 win with Dallas Empire.</p>



<p>Shotzzy is one of the most popular Call of Duty players around, and his charm and rizz are undeniable. He’s one of the stalwarts of the OpTic Texas roster and is a fan-favourite, but it helps that he’s an animal of the game with some of the best movement in the business.</p>



<p>The OpTic Texas team had a slow start to the 2025 season, which wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">helped by roster changes</a>, but Shotzzy is very much at home in Black Ops 6, thanks to the ‘omnimovement’ mechanics.</p>



<p>As a side note, Shotzzy has a prestigious place in the world of esports. He’s one of just two pro players in the world to have earned a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong> – Halo and Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-isaiah-gwinn-gwinn">Isaiah ‘Gwinn’ Gwinn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$63,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Carolina Royal Ravens</p>



<p>Gwinn is a stunning prospect and one of the most talented young players in the Call of Duty pro scene. He broke into the Carolina Royal Ravens roster towards the end of 2023 and has been a recognisable face in the squad ever since, but this year, he has blown up.</p>



<p>In terms of numbers, Gwinn has started strong. He ranks high in almost every category – kills, captures, hill time, first bloods, and so on. His talents were a pivotal part of the Royal Ravens seeing immense success early in the season, with the team putting up some of the best numbers right off the bat.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/">The Royal Ravens</a> even handed Atlanta FaZe the team’s first 0 – 3 loss in two years.</p>



<p>The dominance persisted into Major I, with Carolina eliminating Vegas, OpTic, and Toronto from the Madrid tournament without too much fuss. It’s a team effort to be sure, but Gwinn is outperforming his teammates, including veteran talents SlasheR and TJHaly, in most respects.</p>



<h3 id="h-zack-drazah-jordan">Zack ‘Drazah’ Jordan</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$903,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Drazah can be a hit-and-miss player at times, but he’s been more hit than miss recently. As one of the cockiest players in the Call of Duty League, Drazah has been forced to put his money where his mouth is on numerous occasions, and sometimes, the trash talk hasn’t paid off – but he’s on a streak right now and it’s working well for him.</p>



<p>At the tail end of the 2022 season, Drazah found his feet, netting the trophy in Major IV and then scooping the COD Championship while representing the LA Thieves. He went on to win Major IV again the next season and then relocated to Atlanta FaZe’s starting roster.</p>



<p>From there, things moved on in earnest for Drazah. The AR who once dubbed himself the best SnD player in the world has since won a further two chips under FaZe, as well as a CDL Minor <strong>and </strong>the Esports World Cup. Flanked by the likes of Cellium, aBeZy, and Simp, Drazah could easily come out on top in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-paco-hydra-rusiewiez">Paco ‘HyDra’ Rusiewiez</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$742,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>HyDra is one of the superstars of the Call of Duty League and has been since he surfaced on the New yok Subliners in 2021, slipping under Clayster’s wing and making a name for himself. He’s known as the ‘French Phenom’ for good reason.</p>



<p>In the years since HyDra entered the Call of Duty League, he has won a Pro-Am, three Major tournaments, and a world championship title. He was a part of the New York Subliners roster that devastated the CDL in 2023, winning two Majors and COD Champs. That COD Champs grand final was <strong>historic</strong>, with the Subliners hitting a 5 – 0 scoreline in record time.</p>



<p>Paco has since joined the LA Thieves and is working as an integral part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/la-thieves-cdl-super-team/">the ‘Super Team’ assembled by Nadeshot</a>. He’s been a little sticky to kick off the CDL 2025 season, but his ceiling is almost unparalleled, and he has some solid players around him.</p>



<p>Last season, HyDra ended up with a second-place finish at Champs, and he’s eager for a redemption story this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-tyler-abezy-pharris">Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$1.8 million</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>Atlanta FaZe</p>



<p>Adding aBeZy to this list means that every member of the Atlanta FaZe squad has made it here, but it <strong>just makes sense</strong>. This team has built up so much chemistry over the years that it’s almost unstoppable, and the wins come thick and fast for the squad.</p>



<p>ABeZy is one of the most dependable Call of Duty players in the CDL, and like Simp, he broke into the competitive scene as a prodigy. With Lehr, Pharris makes up the other half of ‘The Tiny Terrors’ on Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>In 2025, aBeZy has already claimed wins at both a Major and a Minor, and in 2024, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-cod-esports-world-cup/">snatched the Esports World Cup win</a> with ease – plus he added another chip to his collection. He was a part of the FaZe roster that dominated the Cold War season, putting up some of the best numbers in competitive COD history.</p>



<p>By numbers, aBeZy is the highest-earning COD pro player in the world, and he has so much left in the tank for the years ahead.</p>



<h3 id="h-dan-ghosty-rothe">Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$267,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>LA Thieves</p>



<p>Ghosty is another member of the LA Thieves ‘Super Team’, a talented IGL with undeniable skills and a charming persona. He’s a likeable player with intense abilities in-game, represented nicely by the attributes he’s secured in a relatively short time in the CDL.</p>



<p>Ghosty’s first shot in the CDL came with OpTic Texas, and from there, he joined the LA Thieves. Nadeshot used Ghosty to build up a team featuring HyDra, Scrappy, and Envoy, and the play has been like clockwork ever since.</p>



<p>While an ultimate victory has escaped Ghosty thus far, his first big win is inching ever closer. In 2024, he landed in second place at the Esports World Cup and has been within spitting distance of netting a chip at a couple of Major tournaments. His in-game skills are front and centre, and the execution to secure a trophy could come during the 2025 season. </p>

<p><strong>Earnings: </strong>$788,000</p>



<p><strong>Team: </strong>OpTic Texas</p>



<p>Dashy is one of the best beamers in the business, boasting ethereal thumbs and the ability to never miss a shot. For that alone, he earns a place on this list of the best Call of Duty players in 2025, but his accolades speak for themselves.</p>



<p>In 2024, Dashy won the Call of Duty League Championship with OpTic Texas, securing his first ring after several years of playing at the highest level. He has the best team possible around him now, and the chemistry is on another level. The future is looking bright for Dashy, and he’s an integral part of one of the biggest brands in esports.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas isn’t in the <strong>best place </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">to start the season</a>, but there’s plenty of time to right the ship and start securing chips.</p>

<p>A little over 20 years ago, Valve was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">getting ready to release a new <em>Half-Life</em> game</a>. At the same time, the company <a href="https://www.bluesnews.com/a/337/valve-unveils-steam-at-2002-game-developer-s-conference">was trying to push Steam</a> as a new option for players to download and update games over the Internet.</p>
<p>Requiring Steam in order to play <em>Half-Life 2</em> led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">plenty of grumbling from players</a> in 2004. But the high-profile Steam exclusive helped build an instant user base for Valve's fresh distribution system, setting it on a path to eventually become the unquestioned leader in the space. The link between the new game and the new platform helped promote a bold alternative to the retail game sales and distribution systems that had dominated PC gaming for decades.</p>

<p>Today, all indications suggest that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/">Valve is getting ready to release a new Half-Life game</a>. At the same time, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/">is getting ready to push SteamOS</a> as a new option for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">third-party hardware makers</a> and individual users to "download and test themselves."</p>
<p>Requiring SteamOS to play <em>Half-Life 3</em> would definitely lead to a lot of grumbling from players. But the high-profile exclusive could help build an instant user base for Valve's fresh operating system, perhaps setting it on the path to become the unquestioned leader in the space. A link between the new game and the new platform could help promote a bold alternative to the Windows-based systems that have dominated PC gaming for decades.</p>
<h2>Not another Steam Machine</h2>
<p>Getting players to change the established platform they use to buy and play games (either in terms of hardware or software) usually requires some sort of instantly apparent benefit for the player. Those benefits can range from the tangible (e.g., an improved controller, better graphics performance) to the ancillary (e.g., social features, achievements) to the downright weird (e.g., a second screen on a portable). Often, though, a core reason why players switch platforms is for access to exclusive "system seller" games that aren't available any other way.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s role in popularizing early Steam shows just how much a highly anticipated exclusive can convince otherwise reluctant players to invest time and effort in a new platform. To see what can happen without such an exclusive, we only need to look to Valve's 2015 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/first-steam-machines-steam-link-controller-hit-stores-november-10/">launch of the Steam Machine hardware line</a>, powered by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/valve-announces-linux-based-steamos-as-basis-for-living-room-gaming/">the first version of the Linux-based SteamOS</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, Valve was selling SteamOS mainly as an alternative to a new Windows 8 environment <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/steams-newell-windows-8-catastrophe-driving-valve-to-embrace-linux/">that Valve co-founder Gabe Newell saw as a "catastrophe" in the making</a> for the PC gaming world. Newell described SteamOS as a "hedging strategy" against Microsoft's potential ability to force all Windows 8 app distribution through the Windows Store, a la Apple's total control of iPhone app distribution.</p>
<p>When Microsoft failed to impose that kind of hegemonic control over Windows apps and games, Valve was left with little else to convince players that it was worth buying a Windows-free Steam Machine (or going through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/everything-you-need-to-know-to-install-steamos-on-your-very-own-computer/">the onerous process of installing the original SteamOS</a> on their gaming rigs). Sure, using SteamOS meant saving a few bucks on a Windows license. But it also meant being stuck with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/the-state-of-linux-gaming-in-the-steamos-era/">an extremely limited library of Linux ports</a> (especially when it came to releases from major publishers) and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/">poor technical performance compared to Windows</a> even when those ports were available.</p>
<p>Given those obvious downsides—and the lack of any obvious upsides—it's no wonder that users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">overwhelmingly ignored SteamOS and Steam Machines</a> at the time. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/analysis-can-steamos-drag-the-pc-game-industry-over-to-linux/">as we argued way back in 2013</a>, a major exclusive on the scale of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 3</em> could have convinced a lot of gamers to overlook at least some of those downsides and give the new platform a chance.</p>

<h2>A little push</h2>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the modern version of SteamOS is in a much better place than the Steam Machine-era version ever was. That's thanks in large part to Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">consistent work</a> on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/valves-steam-play-uses-vulkan-to-bring-more-windows-games-to-linux/">Proton compatibility layer</a>, which lets the Linux-based SteamOS run almost any game that's designed for Windows (with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">only a few major exceptions</a>). That wide compatibility has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/valve-promises-steam-deck-will-run-the-entire-steam-library-at-30-fps/">a huge boon for the Steam Deck</a>, which offered many players easy handheld access to vast swathes of PC gaming for the first time. The Steam Deck also showed off SteamOS's major user interface and user experience benefits over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">clunkier Windows-based gaming portables</a>.</p>

<p>Still, the benefits of switching from Windows to SteamOS might seem a bit amorphous to many players today. If Valve is really interested in pushing its OS as an alternative to Windows gaming, a big exclusive game is just the thing to convince a critical mass of players to make the leap. And when it comes to massive PC gaming exclusives, it doesn't get much bigger than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">the long, long-awaited <em>Half-Life 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>We know it might sound ludicrous to suggest that Valve's biggest game in years should ignore the Windows platform that's been used by practically every PC gamer for decades. Keep in mind, though, that there would be nothing stopping existing Windows gamers from downloading and installing a free copy of the Linux-based SteamOS (likely on a separate drive or partition) to get access to <em>Half-Life 3</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, installing a new operating system (especially one based on Linux) is not exactly a plug-and-play process. But Valve has a long history of streamlining game downloads, updates, and driver installations through Steam itself. If anyone can make the process of setting up a new OS relatively seamless, it's Valve.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>And let's not forget that millions of gamers already have easy access to SteamOS through Steam Deck hardware. Those aging Steam Decks might not be powerful enough to run a game like <em>Half-Life 3</em> at maximum graphics settings, but Valve games have a history of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601540333">scaling down well</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li4s-RUCzQs">low-end systems</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">leaked "Powered by SteamOS" initiative</a> also seems poised to let third-party hardware makers jump in with more powerful (and more <em>Half-Life 3-</em>capable) desktops, laptops, and handhelds with SteamOS pre-installed. And that's before we even consider the potential impact of a more powerful "Steam Deck 2," which Valve's Pierre-Loup&nbsp; Griffais <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/valves-leaked-steam-deck-model-1030-probably-isnt-a-full-version-2-0/">said in 2023</a> could potentially come in "the next couple of years."</p>
<h2>Time for a bold move</h2>
<p>Tying a major game like&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 3</em> to a completely new and largely untested operating system would surely lead to some deafening pushback from gamers happy with the Windows-based status quo. An exclusive release could also be risky if SteamOS ends up showing some technical problems as it tries to grow past its Steam Deck roots (Linux <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/problems-youll-likely-run-into-gaming-on-linux/">doesn't exactly have the best track record</a> when it comes to things like game driver compatibility across different hardware).</p>

<p>Despite all that, we're pretty confident that the vast majority of players interested in <em>Half-Life 3</em> would jump through a few OS-related hoops to get access to the game. And many of those players would likely stick with Valve's gaming-optimized OS going forward rather than spending money on another Windows license.</p>
<p>Even a timed exclusivity window for <em>Half-Life 3 </em>on SteamOS could push a lot of early adopters to see what all the fuss is about without excluding those who refuse to switch away from Windows. Failing even that, maybe a non-exclusive <em>Half-Life 3</em> could be included as a pre-installed freebie with future versions of SteamOS, as an incentive for the curious to try out a new operating system.</p>
<p>With the coming wide release of SteamOS, Valve has a rare opportunity to upend the PC gaming OS dominance that Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">more or less stumbled into decades ago</a>. A game like <em>Half-Life 3</em> could be just the carrot needed to get PC gaming as a whole over its longstanding Windows dependence.</p>
