            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">Roguelike</a> deckbuilders! They're everywhere! It's a bit of an epidemic, honestly, sorting the wheat from chaff is a tough job. Of course, once in a while a genuinely novel take on the genre rolls around, and PinKeep has done just that, a pinball game where you change the playfield as you progress through runs. And it's from the devs behind the Far series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a>!
</p>
<p>
The pinball element is likely self explanatory. There's a ball, it gets shot off, and you have two flippers to hit it with, nothing new there. It's everything else around it that'll have you thinking about the beautiful game (in this world the beautiful game is pinball). Runs are split up into different themed stages, and it's up to you to add elements to the main playing field.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, say you want a bumper somewhere on the field to propel your ball along, you choose from the cards you've collected, and place it at various fixed points. You can rotate such structures to your liking, but to play these cards you need to spend money. To get money, you need to use your ball to destroy trees and rocks. Then you collect resources from these destroyed elements of nature, selling them to merchants at the top of the screen, of which you get to by flinging your ball successfully towards them.
</p><p>
This is further complicated by enemies slowly progressing towards your town of operations, and if they manage to reach you, you lose a bit of health. You'd think hitting enemies would be as much a bit of luck as it is skill, but you also have the ability to slow down time and flick your ball anytime you like, allowing you to line it up just so to take down an enemy combatant.
</p>
<p>
All this took some getting used to, with the fast-paced nature of pinball mixed with slowing down to plot out where you want being an interesting tactical exercise. The thing is, I just don't think you can go wrong with pinball, but the way you can build upon it here makes it much more strategic. Take the aforementioned bumper you can add in. It comes with the added effect of a little goblin that sits on top of it who shoots out arrows at incoming arrows if you hit said bumper.
</p>
<p>
When you build up your field just right there's a nice harmony to it all. I do wonder if adding in changes to the slow motion flick or the flippers themselves would add something or overcomplicate things, but as it is in its current demo, PinKeep is heading in the right direction. You can try it out for yourself, or just wishlist it, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700">here</a>.

<p>The ARC Raiders Headwinds season launches on Tuesday, January 27, 2026. The expansion brings several updates to the game, including new cosmetics, new quests, a new map condition, and a new matchmaking level option for those who have reached level 40 or higher. This is in addition to other items and general quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team announced the arrival on social media. This is only the first step in the roadmap, which outlines plans for the game through April 2026 and promises even more content for the popular extraction shooter.</p>

<p>Players will still have to wait until April for a new map, expected to be a waterborne map, to arrive in the game, something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all players are happy about.</a> However, the game has been an overall success, netting over 10 million sales since its release in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <p>Despite the death threats he faced when first deciding to bring Konami's horror franchise to the big screen, director of the third Silent Hill movie, Return to Silent Hill, would be open to adapting a further game for the big screen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/">Variety</a>, director Christophe Gans said that whilst critics panned 2006's Silent Hill adaptation, "the reputation of the movie has grown", giving him a new audience in the "2.0 generation of Silent Hill lovers" that he hopes to tap into for this new adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>

<p>"If I have the opportunity, we'll come back to Silent Hill once more," he said. "I'm not looking at Silent Hill only as a great video game. I'm looking at it as a piece of modern art. It has something really edgy and experimental. I will adapt another chapter because there are some that are extremely good, something very different from the first film, and now Return to Silent Hill. I like this world, and I can see that plenty of people are thinking I'm doing a pretty good job."</p>
<p>Gans also revealed that when he announced interest in adapting the series for 2006's Silent Hill, he received "plenty" of death threats.</p>
<p>"It was a big challenge to adapt correctly and respectfully a game which is considered a classic," Gans added. "We know that the people who love video games are very passionate. I remember when I did the first film, I received plenty of death threats. People were saying, 'If you mess up this one, we are going to find you.' So I came onto the first film with great responsibility, and certainly even more with the second one. At the same time, it was important for me to imagine a movie that people who are not playing games can be interested in."</p><p>Return to Silent Hill is part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Unfortunately, it's not faring much better than its panned predecessor, Silent Hill Revelation: at the time of writing, it's sitting at 31 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/return-to-silent-hill/">Metacritic</a> (and a 4.4 user score), and 15 on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (30% user score). Admittedly, it's only the end of January, but that makes it the worst-reviewed movie of the year to date on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/movie/?releaseYearMin=2025&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=20">one of the worst released over the last 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, Silent Hill: Revelation has a Metacritic score of 16 (4.5 from users).</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> was never a game that was going to win me over, as I generally only like single-player shooters if any, but it isn't helped by the fact that since its announcement there hasn't been a lick of actual marketing to help it prove itself. This, of course, has been the subject of much discourse, to which I will contribute slightly in the coming paragraphs, but the main point of all this is to say that actually, against all odds, Highguard is in fact sticking to its January 26th launch date, and will even show off some gameplay… on its release day.
</p>
<p>
This comes from a singular Dweet on the game's Dwitter account, explaining the following: "Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase. Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more." You'll note Devolver Digital being its usual cheeky self in the replies asking if the devs need a publisher; "There's still time."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Now, I don't care to be marketed to, excessively, moderately, or conservatively, the last of which is still generous in Highguard's case. It's just I can't tell if releasing a game after one trailer is an act of supreme hubris, well-placed confidence, or riding on the assumption that it being from the creators of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. I have to wonder if developer Wildlight Entertainment thought that such a pedigree was enough in this pre-established property-led world we live in.
</p>
<p>
Highguard might have some old guard talent, but we don't live in the same world as film, plastering names over trailers of other games doesn't suggest guaranteed quality, it invites comparison. Games have to prove themselves in the pudding, and so far on most counts Highguard hasn't done a very good job of that. The only benefit it currently has is all of this technically bad (absent) PR might make enough people curious enough to play it, and it is free so that's easy enough to do. Guess we'll find out in a week or so!

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe in years past, such an intro would fill us with excitement and anticipation; after all, a peek behind the development curtain is always a welcome treat. But in 2026, the line is a signifier of bad news.</p>
<p>Said opening almost always leads to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"We've got some news today. As the launch date has approached, it's become clear that [GAME] needs a little more time to bring it to the quality that we want for it and that you deserve. Therefore, we've taken the difficult decision to delay the game until next year.</em><br>
<em>We know this is disappointing, and it's not a decision we make lightly. However, we're looking forward to sharing the game with you without compromise, with our original vision intact."</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xhsmlu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Whether you have a casual interest in the industry or you are the most capital of Capital-G-Gamers, we'd wager that you've seen something like this at least once in the past 12 months. You probably saw a couple in the 12 months before that, too. And the year before that. And th...</p>
<p>Demand for games remains high, but delays seem to be cropping up more in recent years than ever before — heck, remember when Devolver Digital made a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/devolver-will-reveal-all-games-pushed-to-2024-in-next-weeks-devolver-delayed-showcase">'Delayed' showcase</a> back in 2023? No one sub-group of developers or publishers is guiltier than any other, either. Indies and AAA releases alike are pushed from the planned launch to a later date, window or, occasionally, indefinitely. It feels like it's happening <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<h2>'Please Understand' - The Delay Cycle</h2>
<p>To illustrate our point, here are a handful of games we were really looking forward to that got delayed on Switch in the last 12 months alone:</p>

<p>That was just 2025 delays, and without mention of the giant <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA 6</a>-shaped hole in the middle of it all. So, when we say it feels like it's happening everywhere, we really mean it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f88c54c4dc23f"><a title="Delay Messages" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f88c54c4dc23f/delay-messages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No "Dear Gamers" Cyberpunk 2077 yellow in sight — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get us wrong, we'd much rather that a game is delayed and launches in a good state, than being rushed out with missing features or more serious issues to boot. Our backlogs are long enough already, so hearing that something has been pushed back from a busy season isn't always the worst news. It's just confusing when it happens time and again.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> does it keep happening? The industry is hurting, the COVID-19 pandemic threw everything off, and economic factors obviously hold huge influence over decisions, but there has to be more to it. With <em>so many</em> games being delayed, it surely can't just be a case of unexpected bumps in the road to release, where project managers aren't learning from previous well-publicised mistakes.</p>
<p>"Most often, it stems from teams missing their production goals or not quite reaching the level of quality they want from their project," System Shock 2 producer <strong>Justin Khan</strong> tells us. "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/system-shock-2-suffers-unexpected-delay-on-switch">This delay</a> actually stemmed from our initial desire to upgrade the project from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for these ports. We spent several months on this exploration, during which we were unable to successfully deploy to the Switch and Switch 2 [...] With more time, I’m sure we could have made the engine upgrade work and deployed on all platforms, but production time was running short, and so we had to pivot quickly."</p>
<p>Experimentation was a similar time sink in Revolution Software's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, which landed a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-lands-last-minute-delay-on-switch">last-minute Switch delay</a> back in 2024. "We initially used tools to help upscale and then over-draw," studio co-founder <strong>Charles Cecil</strong> tells us, "[but] we pretty quickly realised that artists recolouring the backgrounds from scratch resulted in a much higher quality than when attempting to use these tools."</p>
<figure data-uuid="48224afc51751"><a title="Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - Reforged" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/48224afc51751/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Revolution Software</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Sometimes there isn’t a great explanation or nuanced message that could be written that wouldn’t be [better summarised] by a simple 'we need more time'," says Khan.</p>
<p>Sassy Chap Games echoed this sentiment when we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/youve-gotta-make-it-more-sexy-final-fantasy-and-persona-voice-actors-have-made-a-dating-sim-for-everyone">spoke about Date Everything's second delay</a> last year ("It was absolutely a blessing that we had the delay to make sure that everything was ironed out and gone through"), as does <strong>Celia Schilling</strong> of Yacht Club Games' Mina the Hollower. "The team needed more time to apply some final polish and balancing to the game," she says. "We know that indefinite delay announcements can feel scary, especially in the indie scene, so we wanted to explicitly express that this delay wasn’t a major one."</p>
<p>The reason itself vary between projects, naturally, but what remains consistent across many of the dreaded delay messages is a genuine attempt to apologise and convince fans that it'll all be worthwhile in the end. Given the passion of fans and the familiarity of the delay announcement format, it's a difficult message to get right.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to do the big text screen jpeg that everyone shows on social media," Necrosoft's <strong>Brandon Sheffield</strong> says about Demonschool's last-minute delay message. "So we kept the statement short, and just tried to move along. We ignored all the people being mad at us as best we could."</p>
<p>It's easy to suggest that devs should just announce their games closer to release, but very few indie studios have the luxury of near-silence until launch that we see from a Team Cherry or ConcernedApe. For players, though, it's a disheartening experience when months of buzz and trailers leave you excited to play a game at a specific time (over a holiday or long weekend, let's say), only for that prospect to be taken away at the last second.</p>
<p>Rest assured, the developers are similarly disappointed. "In our case, it was a tough decision, but we unanimously agreed it needed to happen", says Schilling. Nightdive's Khan agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Demoralisation is a strong word, but it accurately describes the situation when the team works incredibly hard, pulling long hours to meet an approaching deadline, only for the game to be delayed anyway. In those moments, it can feel like all that effort was for nothing. But the relief sets in quickly knowing that there is now additional time to polish things further and ensure the final product is as high quality as possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if a delay needs to happen, that's not to say that the dev necessarily wants it to. Aside from player expectations, which Sheffield describes as a "big worry" in the run-up to a delay announcement, there's also the team itself to think about. Though it can bring relief, a delay can also extend stress even longer.</p>
<p>"Overall I think the delay was good for us, but it did cause a lot of turmoil within the studio, and contributed to burnout, among other things," Sheffield says of Demonschool's second delay. "It was better for the game, and better for us in the long run, but it definitely wasn't fun, we didn't take it lightly, and we hope to not do anything like that again anytime soon!"</p>
<h2>Planning Problems vs. Outside Influence</h2>
<p>Nobody wants a delay to happen, so do we have to question the practice of choosing an initial release date instead? If devs know that bumps, experimentation, and polish time are likely, why pick a release date that underestimates them? At this point, surely there's enough project timeline data on the causes of delays to suggest that no, you're probably not going to hit that November launch.</p>
<p>For Nightdive, System Shock 2's release date "was forecasted by doing some optimistic time horizon math," with specific weekly targets that the team needed to hit to remain on track. For Yacht Club, it was based on how the game had performed at SteamNext Fest and SGF. Plus, "Halloween felt fitting, and it lined up perfectly with our plans."</p>
<figure data-uuid="25e4947969b82"><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25e4947969b82/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's certainly an element of better scheduling practices needed. A delay by a couple of days/weeks/months is understandable, but what were you thinking with the original date otherwise?</p>
<p>Other bumps in the road can affect plans, too. Nintendo's eShop certification process is a long one (if you can believe it, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">some of the titles</a> that end up on there), and we've heard of several developers getting caught in the bottleneck and missing their launch because they didn't have the final copy ready for Nintendo's approval in time — "a minimum of 30 days before your release date," according to Khan. It's a similar story told by Wadjet Eye Games' Dave Gilbert last year, when Nintendo's "frustrating" cert process meant the point-and-click adventure game Old Skies was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/frustrating-nintendo-cert-process-causes-last-minute-switch-delay-for-old-skies">delayed at the eleventh hour</a> despite being submitted months before.</p>
<p>Such problems are multiplied on the physical front. Bitmap Bureau <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/terminator-2d-no-fate-has-been-delayed-on-all-consoles">pushed Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> from its initial launch date three times due to "ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions". It's difficult to block out release windows when cart production and supply chain problems are out of your control.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's the big issue that very few studios want to discuss outright: budget. Aside from being demoralising, a delay is an expensive affair, often requiring months' worth of extra funds from <em>somewhere</em> to get across the finish line.</p>
<p>"Previously, the ‘waterfall’ approach favoured by publishers locked scope, time, and cost into a rigid contract," Cecil says. "If any aspect of the work required was underestimated, then the only variable that could be cut back would be quality."</p>
<p>The nature of post-launch updates, promised fixes, and DLC down the line means things are slightly different these days, but a game's initial budget still usually dictates when work on a project must end. After all, how can you keep tweaking when all the funds have dried up?</p>
<figure data-uuid="6e2d82a902bc0"><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e2d82a902bc0/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Schilling says she's confident Yacht Club's "financial runway is still there" for Mina, she admits that the team "had to make our operations costs stretch and cut back on expenses like our office space." A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> report last year confirmed that the studio planned to be fully remote by 2026. Likewise, Broken Sword's delay "pushed our finances to the limit," says Cecil, with the project relying on Kickstarter support to "achieve our desired level of ambition."</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are occasions where a delay sees the publisher pick up the slack, as was the case for Demonschool: "Basically if our publisher hadn't kindly decided to fund us during that delay it would've been impossible. So thanks to Ysbryd for that!"</p>
<p>Live service models aside, it seems clear that launch for many titles is increasingly a necessity to get some money rolling in so that post-launch development can continue - a form of Early Access without the label, essentially. If everything has been squeezed dry and the project <em>still</em> isn't up to snuff, what option do you have?</p>
<p>Of course, big players like Nintendo can silently sit on games for months before launch, but that's a huge anomaly in the industry at large. (Yes, before you say it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> is certainly an outlier.) In retrospect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s delay felt as much a question of picking the perfect launch window for the marketing campaign as it did the game needing extra time in the oven.</p>
<p>And what about, after all that planning, something else comes along to disrupt the waters? Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Silksong</a>'s surprise launch a mere two weeks after its long-anticipated release date announcement, the likes of Demonschool and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baby_steps">Baby Steps</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">were pushed back</a> to escape the blast radius.</p>
<p>"We had a special case in that 100% of the reason we delayed Demonschool was because Silksong announced it was releasing the day after us," Sheffield tells us. "We knew we couldn't compete with them for attention, so we were forced to delay."</p>
<h2>'Thank You For Your Patience' - What's The Answer?</h2>
<p>It's a multi-pronged problem, then. It would be easy to sit here and say that a delay could have been avoided with better planning at the jump, but certification woes, economic troubles, and budgetary constraints aren't as easily predicted as 'we might need more time to test XYZ'.</p>
<p>Not making an announcement until everything is set in stone feels like an obvious fix, but you need a <em>lot</em> of established street cred — and money in the bank — to pull off a shadow drop, and the marketing train has got to leave the station early if you're a small to mid-sized dev and you want your roguelike deckbuilder to stand out in the crowd.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a78b658c45f9a"><a title="Delayed Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a78b658c45f9a/delayed-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Those eShop views don't come easily — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/35-upcoming-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-to-look-forward-to-in-2026">2026 release calendar</a> is yet another year bolstered by its predecessor's delays. Scan through the list that we outlined at the start of this article, and you'll see a bunch of tentative '2026' dates still hanging on games that were slated for the year prior. No biggies have been pushed back in the early weeks of this year, but it's only a matter of time. Delays will come, and when they do, we won't be surprised.</p>
<p>So what's the solution? Every developer we spoke to seemed genuinely confident in their initial dates, and it was only once launch loomed that it became apparent all the pieces wouldn't fit together. 'More realistic scheduling' feels a little oversimplified.</p>
<p>With more layoffs and studio closures happening every month, the 'quick fix' of improved budgets and resources also seems unlikely. If studios could find a way to better handle the unexpected and land on their launch date with their project — and their well-being — still intact, brilliant! But without a radical shift in how profits are distributed amongst large companies, it's unclear where that money could come from.</p>
<p>"It’s all business at the end of the day, which is hardly ever just black or white," Khan says. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping delays for good, but if indies and AAA behemoths are equally likely to succumb to deadline drama, then we can't see them going away any time soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Every month, Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella posts fascinating data about video game sales on Bluesky, highlighting trends like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana">November’s historically bad month for game hardware</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month"><em>Battlefield 6</em>’s big launch in October</a>. But he doesn’t just share data about what is selling the most; as of late, he’s also posted delightful lists of games that have sold just a single physical copy over a certain period of time, and the lists often include retro games that take me down memory lane or titles that I didn’t even know existed.</p><p>The list of games that sold one physical copy <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">in October</a>, for example, includes the Xbox 360 version of <em>Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em> for the PS3. On Thursday, Piscatella posted the “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3md22ljxazs2o">2025 Circana Thread for Sickos</a>” highlighting games that only sold one physical unit over the <em>whole year</em> across various handhelds and consoles.</p><p>That list of games that sold a single unit in October was born out of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markcasey.bsky.social/post/3m62zi33ssk22">a question</a> from a user on Bluesky, Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “People seemed to enjoy the combination of journey down memory lane and the treasure hunting idea of these games being out there somewhere,” Piscatella says. Then people started asking him about it, so he thought it’d be fun to keep doing it.</p><p>Circana is able to track the data because it has agreements with “all major retailers” that let it compile and analyze point-of-sale data, Piscatella says. “I​​f a retailer’s point-of-sale system scans a product as a sale, it will show up in the data.” That means all the games he has mentioned in these threads “had one new unit floating around out there somehow that was sold through a register or via an online purchase. Perhaps it was a unit that had been lost somewhere in the back, or was buried under a display, or who knows.”</p><p>While it’s fun to look back and laugh at some of the games people bought — I feel sorry for the poor soul who purchased <em>Metroid: Other M</em> for the Wii last year — people buying an older, obscure game from a store is more common than you might think, Piscatella says. “There were more than 1,000 games across all platforms (including PC) that sold between one and five new physical units in the US during 2025, while over 3,500 different games sold at least one new physical unit at retail last year overall,” according to Piscatella. “Retailers have all kinds of stuff hidden away in those stores of theirs.”</p><p>I asked Piscatella how long he plans to continue making the threads highlighting games selling just one copy. “So long as it stays fun, I reckon,” he says. “But who knows.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/867004/circana-gaming-sales-data-mat-piscatella-one-copy-obscure-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/</link>
            <guid>1415107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has teased a potential crossover coming to Escape from Tarkov with a new promo code. This promo code and imagery to accompany it suggest that a ‘duck hunt’ themed event might be surfacing soon. This follows suggestions that Escape from Duckov and Escape from Tarkov will be hosting a crossover collaboration.</p>



<p>When you enter the Escape from Tarkov promo code, you’re greeted by a suite of items, including double-barreled shotguns, armor, vests, and ammunition, all of which you can use to <strong>hunt ducks</strong>.</p>











<p>When you load up the Escape from Tarkov launcher, be sure to enter the new bonus code, <strong>WILDHUNT</strong>. This will unlock the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>2 x MP-43-1C double-barreled shotguns</li>



<li>2 x Korund-VM body armor</li>



<li>2 x 6Sh112 S-S vests</li>



<li>2 x Ushanka hats</li>



<li>40 x AP-20 shotgun slugs</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many believe this promo code is teasing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov collaboration event</a>, which first hit the airwaves a couple of weeks ago. The team behind Escape from Duckov posted cryptic images suggesting that Tarkov’s big bosses, Killa and Tagilla, have made their way into the duck-themed extraction universe.</p>



<p>The image that was posted by Battlestate Games to share the new promo code features targets hammered by birdshot, and on those targets are quite clearly <strong>duck </strong>silhouettes.</p>



<p>The player character in the foreground is simply wearing the items offered in the new promo code.</p>



<p>Recently, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov suggested that collaborations are incoming and asked the community for some guidance on what kind of topics should be included in that. There’s a whole world out there, but players mostly wanted realistic, grounded collaborations, and not ‘Fortnite-like’ crossovers with gaudy skins and in-game takeovers.</p>







<p>Let us know if you’ve figured out what this new Tarkov promo code is teasing on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>While playing Square Enix's acclaimed 2020 remake on Nintendo's old hybrid would have felt like a pipedream, FFVII looks, runs, and feels exceptionally good on Switch 2. Sure, there are some technical downgrades from the PS5 version here and there *<em>cough</em>* 30fps *<em>cough</em>*, but overall, this is a rather wonderful display of what the new hardware can muster.</p>
<p>At least, that's what our Alana thought in her <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">9/10 review</a> of Square Enix's latest "remarkable" project. "For those who haven’t touched Final Fantasy VII before and are worried, don’t fret," she wrote, "even with some of the additions, the Switch 2 port is still an amazing way to experience (part of) one of the most influential games of all time."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196050 @ 1769277726 -->
<p>With the Switch 2 port now out in the wild, we want to know what you lovely lot make of it so far — whether this is your first time stepping into Midgar or if you're something of a seasoned professional by this point.</p>
<p>You can let us know your review score for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade by using the poll below. Of course, we don't expect you all to have finished it just yet, but that's the magic of this poll, you can come back and change your vote whenever you'd like!</p>

            <p>Bethesda is working to "address some of the topics that appeared" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> update released earlier this week.</p>
<p>The update was supposed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-gets-another-hefty-patch-complete-with-ghoulish-fixes-and-quest-improvements">address a number of issues across quests, localisation, armour, and more</a>. However, the team has already had to disable the Weekly Raid Challenge due to reports that "the challenge was automatically completing, which resulted in rewards not being obtainable".</p>
<p>The developer says it is now "looking into" your reports and is using community feedback to identify a list of topics that "we plan to address in an update that is currently planned for release during the first week of February".</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-developing-action-rpg-lore/</link>
            <guid>1415068</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sledgehammer Games is best known for creating or contributing to the development of the Call of Duty franchise. The studio started in 2011 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and most recently assisted the likes of Treyarch and Raven Software on Black Ops 7, released towards the end of 2025.</p>



<p>But thanks to a recent developer profile on LinkedIn, it seems that the studio is (or at least <em>was</em>) working on an ‘unannounced action RPG’ with deep lore and a large-scale world.</p>



<p>It would be like nothing Sledgehammer has ever created.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-sledgehammer-making-a-new-rpg">Is Sledgehammer Making a New RPG?</h2>



<p>Sledgehammer Games has been <strong>mostly </strong>a support studio for the last few years, only leading the way on a couple of Call of Duty games: Modern Warfare III (2023) and Vanguard (2021). Elsewhere, the team has assisted in the creation of several other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that the studio has scope to create something new, but nobody had any money on the company’s next game being an action RPG.</p>



<p>For reference, the top action RPG games could be anything from Diablo to the likes of Fallout, depending on how you quantify or categorize the term ‘action RPG’.</p>



<p>In the most recent news for Sledgehammer Games, it was determined that the studio was working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch ports</a> for Call of Duty titles, but that tidbit is already months in the past.</p>



<p>This revelation about Sledgehammer’s action RPG title comes from the profile of a former developer, Ben Wanat. He’s now the Creative Director and co-founder of Lurker Entertainment, but from 2019 to August 2025, he worked at Sledgehammer Games as a Senior Creative Director.</p>



<p>In the blurb for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-wanat-17842671/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his role at Sledgehammer Games</a>, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Creative director for Unannounced action RPG</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise planning, pitching, hiring, planning</li>



<li>Directing prototypes, player mechanics for mechanics-rich design</li>



<li>World layout, location layout</li>



<li>Concept and asset creation for cultures, environments, characters</li>



<li>Lore books for world, cultures, languages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qlfrdb/sledgehammer_games_is_working_on_an_unannounced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>Otherwise, Wanat only contributed assistance to the development of Vanguard and seems to have had <strong>no hand </strong>in Modern Warfare III, which means he was likely free to contribute <strong>mostly </strong>towards the unannounced action RPG game.</p>



<p>Given the description of his role, it’s safe to assume that the game has/had deep lore, a branching world, innovative mechanics, and all-new, fictional cultures, races, and languages.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This coming-of-age adventure game made me feel a little too seen]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam</link>
            <guid>1415053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a lot about <em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em>’s Mara that I find relatable. Like me, she’s recently moved to a place simply called “the City” from the middle of nowhere, and like me, she’s an avid writer. But these biographical details aren’t the important thing; it’s the way she’s painted by the game’s incredibly sharp writing where I start to feel uncomfortably seen. There are a lot of characters in media that are awkward or socially anxious, but few that are drawn with such piercing specificity.</p><p>The point-and-click game is minimalist in its mechanics. Consisting mostly of conversations, it’s broken up by a few puzzles, object interactions, and minigames. This is not a complaint: it’s in talking to people that the game shines, because it’s how we get to see most of Mara. And she’s such a realized and resonant portrait of a person that I found myself grasping at where we were different as a coping mechanism against spending the <em>whole</em> time introspecting. I pride myself, for example, on never having had an awful boyfriend. In this, surely, I could find some self-soothing superiority over this poor video game character.</p><p>The dynamics of Mara’s relationship with her controlling, older, long-distance partner are sketched with both narrative and mechanical thoughtfulness. In one conversation, a health bar suddenly appears, and you must navigate a particularly difficult conversation without losing all of your hearts, some of which you gain only if you’ve spent time nurturing other connections. It’s one of many neat metaphors, and combined with the clever moment-to-moment writing, led to a particularly notable moment, which wrenched an “oh, for fuck’s sake” out of my mouth in real life.</p><p>It was then that I had completely bought into <em>Station to Station</em> . I thought I had the shape of it. Dear relatable Mara and her messy relationships that I could hold as a simplifying buffer between us. But the game wouldn’t settle for simplicity.</p><p>Aside from conversation, the other important mechanic is Mara’s writing. These manifest in assignments for school, guest blog posts, and, in one real low moment for Mara, an overly involved forum post, and you’ll need to combine topics together to complete the piece in question. These topics include the city, music, and sex, and they level up as you talk to people and experience the world. It’s a pretty simple but effective representation of how writing works: you learn things through living and then combine ideas into, hopefully, something new and expressive.</p><p>There’s one piece that works differently. Mara writes a story that is clearly a thinly veiled allegory for her own life, and a tutor gives her some relatively harsh feedback. For the rest of the game, the story looms in the back of her mind. You can’t fix this just by combining a thought your friend had about movies and your own ruminations on death caused by your ailing grandmother. But each of those might help a little as you chip away at it bit by bit. Without getting too self-indulgent about my own recent writing experiences, suffice to say <em>Station to Station </em>had once again skewered me. I had Mara work on it whenever I could, every time reminded of my own festering project and the trust necessary to wait and address it slowly.</p><p>At this point in the game, it’s clear that the aforementioned partner is not Mara’s only problem. In fact, most of her interactions with other characters are marred in some way or another. I, for one, would simply not get involved with these people! But again, the game resists simplicity. Although it always presents harmful interpersonal dynamics honestly and without excusing bad behavior, it absolutely refuses the idea of shutting yourself away to avoid them. Because you would miss out on too much. Too much joy, too much connection, too much potential.</p><p>In one of the only conversations in the game that feels purely uncomplicated and productive, a character tells Mara “you just have to risk it with someone and see.” <em>Station to Station </em>argues, over and over again, that being open to others, despite the risk of awkwardness, and of not being treated well, is worth it. Mara is naive, and not very good at knowing what she wants, let alone asking for it. And she does get hurt. But she also lives a much more beautiful life when she doesn’t close herself off to experiences and people. She deals with the consequences, and through this she learns and grows and flourishes. My knee-jerk perceived superiority in being avoidant is suddenly the crack through which <em>Station to Station</em> has sunk its claws into me. I will be thinking about it for a very long time.</p><p>There’s a lot more I could talk about, like the multiple excellent musical interludes, or the hugely exaggerated animations that feel genuinely expressive while also being consistently comedic. I could even complain bitterly about some of the incidental environmental puzzles and the way they ground the story to a screeching halt if you happened to miss one small interaction point. But what kept me thinking about the game long after the credits rolled was its emotional honesty and the emotional honesty it demanded of me while playing it.</p><p>After playing the game, I stewed for a couple of days, thinking about Mara, myself, and one particularly memorable bit of karaoke. And then it hit me: I never finished Mara’s rewrite. No matter how important it felt in the moment, it turned out to be much less crucial than Mara and I opening ourselves up and accepting the consequences, good and bad.</p><p><sub>Perfect Tides: Station to Station<em> is out now on PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE0MTA="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Castello</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Legend of Heroes series has been an absolute rollercoaster for me for the last few years. As much as I love the idea of the franchise, the deeply interconnected nature of it all got way too daunting and exhausting for me. The fresh start of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak in 2023 was exactly what I needed, but a year later, its sequel came out and promptly fell right back into the frustrating trappings of requiring you to play a half-dozen other&nbsp;100-hour JRPGs in order to understand its wildly inconsistent story. Then, last year, an even fresher&nbsp;start was released with the highly anticipated remake Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter. I loved my time with that game, and I’m really excited to continue following that saga with its next entry. The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;isn’t that entry, and while it is one of the most mechanically dense and fun games in the franchise, it’s another title that feels like the RPG equivalent of Avengers: Infinity War.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1oBqx-afNCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;puts you in the shoes of three different protagonists, as well as their three different crews of comrades and companions. These aren’t entirely new heroes who you’ll grow alongside, though – they’re the main characters of three different eras of the various arcs in this series, and you’re expected to know their history to understand what they’re doing now. There’s Van Arkride from the Trails through Daybreak duology, Rean Schwarzer from the numerous Trails of Cold Steel entries, and&nbsp;Kevin Graham returning all the way from Trails in the Sky the 3rd (a game we’ll likely end up seeing a big-budget remake of in just a few years).</p>


<p>A large majority of the 70ish hour campaign follows Van Arkride specifically, which I appreciated as someone who played both of his games, barely remembers Rean Schwarzers’ games, and barely ever played Kevin Graham’s starring entry. It feels good to have Van continue to carry the leading-man mantle for this entry, even if it doesn’t have the word Daybreak in the title – and it’s really satisfying to see him bounce off of so many new characters and get wrapped up in a world that feels so much larger than where he started.</p>


<p>All three characters are caught in a web of cascading mysteries and conspiracies stemming from Project Startaker – an initiative being spun up by the nation of Calvard that aims to send humanity to space for the first time ever. It’s kind of silly, realizing that it’s taken this long for something as simple as manned spaceflight to happen in a universe where arguably every other trope in JRPG history has occured by this point. Despite being the character I was probably the least excited to follow, Rean’s story ended up being the most interesting one of them all. It’s really cool seeing him focus on digging into the secretive truth of Project Startaker, and unraveling the layers of conspiracy behind it during his sections had me gripped. </p>
<p>Kevin’s story sees him becoming a “Heretic Hunter” and grappling with the morality of who he’s being tasked to hunt – it’s interesting on paper, but I got the vibe that it would have landed a lot harder with me if I knew more about him going into this game. Van’s story, which is much longer than the other two characters, spends a lot of time either slowly building up to big moments or simply idling around in fun, but ultimately inconsequential smaller adventures. All three stories end up colliding into each other in a really, really awesome way, though. Even without the full context or attachment from previous games that made the journey to get to that ending feel a little underwhelming, the conclusion to this game is big and fun and impossible not to get at least a little excited about.</p>

<p>Narrative shortcomings aside,&nbsp;The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;is easily the most jam-packed game in the series in terms of combat systems, mini-games, and modes. When it comes to combat, some of the additions are pretty minor but still appreciated improvements. Like the ZOC mechanic that lets you steal enemy turn bonuses on the attack order timeline in turn-based battles. Or BLTZ, a new bonus ability that basically allows back-row party members to more actively support front-row party members during their turns in battle. My favourite is probably Awakening – it lets Rean, Van, and Kevin activate special powered-up modes that give them enhanced attacks and damage during real-time combat. I’m a sucker for the real-time combat in the latest Trails games, so having more features to play with in that mode is a blast.</p>
<p>I loved the Reverie Corridor from Trails into Reverie and the Märchen Garten from The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II, so I was happy to see those modes expanded upon with the Grim Garten in this entry. Like the previous two named modes, it’s a roguelike-inspired mode that sees you diving into randomised sets of dungeons and battles, gathering set item rewards and even gacha-style prizes as you successfully finish runs. I think there’s a secret sauce to the idea of a roguelike JRPG dungeon crawler, and I almost wish that we could get an entire game built around this concept. To me, it’s a really fresh and rewarding way to frame the idea of repeated dungeon crawls that would otherwise feel repetitive and bland compared to the usual open exploration the series is known for.</p>

<p>Despite a narrative that struggles to shine from beneath a dense layer of established franchise lore, I had a great time playing&nbsp;The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon.&nbsp;It may not be the right follow-up to&nbsp;Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;in terms of how engaging and understandable the story is, but it is absolutely a worthy follow-up when it comes to how fun it is, how dense the combat is, and how rich the world is with interactivity and unlockables.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> was supposed to be feature complete, with no major updates coming our way since 2021, but it turns out it's hard to keep a game that's sold nearly 50 million units down. A couple months back, Nintendo made the surprise announcement that Animal Crossing: New Horizons would be receiving a <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid Nintendo Switch 2 update, as well as a free 3.0 update</a> adding new content and long-requested quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Do these updates justify returning to your (perhaps-long-neglected) island? Or is it not worth the trouble to even squash the cockroaches in your house? Sail on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing20.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's begin with the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition as it’s the update with an actual price tag, albeit a reasonable $5 one. The game, which suffered from fairly obvious jaggies on the OG Switch, now looks much crisper as it runs at 4K while docked (likely 1440p boosted to 4K using DLSS like most Switch 2 upgrades). Everything just has nice sharp edges now, which really benefits a lot of the intricately-detailed small objects and props in the game, but, of course, there is a limit to how transformed a game with Animal Crossing's visual style is going to be by a resolution bump (I would have perhaps liked to see HDR support too).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing21.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 upgrade also comes with a few other assorted additions, like mouse controls for drawing patterns and the ability to call out villager's names using the built in mic. There are also some improvements that simply come with the more modern hardware, like faster load times (a boon considering how much of a pain they were previously). That said, you're mainly paying for the visual fidelity boost, which I do think most people will find worthwhile at the price of a Big Mac, but that's up to you.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing22.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arguably more interesting, at least from a new content perspective, is the 3.0 update, which, again, is available for free for both Switch 1 and 2 players. The big addition is the Hotel, which pops up on the pier and is run by Kapp'n and his reptilian pirate crew. Players are asked to design hotel rooms based on certain themes, with the game providing some items to fit those themes, and are rewarded with tickets that can be traded at the Hotel's shop for exclusive items. If this sounds very much like a stripped-down version of the not-that-keenly-remembered Happy Home Paradise DLC, well, that's because that’s basically what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing23.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Hotel is a fine addition for those who just can't get enough decorating, but there's no real challenge to it -- you can craft the perfect themed hotel rooms if you want, but you can also just slap more-or-less whatever together and still earn your tickets. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the hotel is that it attracts a steady stream of new animals to your island, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your temperament. On the one hand, some fresh blood! On the other hand, some folks who have very specifically curated their island's vibes and population may not enjoy all these new weirdos wandering around (I’m a YIMBY island manager myself).</p>



<p>The other big content addition are "Slumber Islands" -- essentially spare islands you can tinker with to your heart's desire, which, again, is great for the designers out there who just want more, more, more space for their designing, but they likely won’t be a game-changer for those who come to Animal Crossing for other things.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing24.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the other 3.0 changes fall under the umbrella of QoL improvements, such as the ability to further expand your storage and craft directly using items in said storage, greatly reducing the amount of inventory juggling required. You can also now craft items in batches, activate a grid for designing outdoors, and get Mr. Resetti to clean up the junk on your island. All these changes are straightforward positives, with Mr. Resetti being particularly helpful for me, as my son has turned parts of my island into a bit of a hoarder’s paradise. Honestly, some may lightly curse Nintendo for not adding some of these features earlier.</p>



<p>Oh, and another thing! After being missing in action since the Gamecube days, you can again collect classic Nintendo consoles that actually allow you to play real retro games within New Horizons. Unfortunately, the implementation leaves a bit to be desired, as the selection of games is thin, light on bangers, <em>and </em>requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to work. Come on Nintendo, you couldn't have just given loyal Animal Crossing fans Clu Clu Land and Ice Climbers as freebies?</p>

<h2 id="h-a-final-form-on-the-horizon"><strong>A Final Form on the Horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and the 3.0 update don't alter the vibes or scope of this well-worn game in any serious way, but their addition results in a more complete-feeling total package. Long-requested quality-of-life improvements are here, gameplay from the oft-ignored Happy Home Paradise DLC has essentially been folded into the main game, and everything looks sharp as a tack. Personally, I'm more interested in seeing where the Animal Crossing series sails off to next, but these updates ought to make your remaining days in this particular paradise more playable and pleasant than previous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update is available to download now on Switch 1 and 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade can be purchased for $5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Fans Disappointed at Five-Month Wait for New Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the ARC Raiders roadmap for 2026, lifting the lid on a long-awaited pipeline of content for the all-new extraction adventure title. It arrives after the festive window saw a little lull for the game, with players complaining about content stagnation and a lack of things to do outside of the winter-themed event.</p>



<p>The new roadmap has rewarded patient players with four months of content, but some argue that it’s taking too long to release key elements, like new maps. The last (and first) new map was Stella Montis, released midway through November, but the <strong>next new map </strong>won’t arrive until <strong>April</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-suffering-from-a-lack-of-updates">Is ARC Raiders Suffering From a Lack of Updates?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be a smash hit, pulling in around 12 million sales since dropping on October 31, and it has reshaped the face of the extraction genre. That hasn’t stopped players from complaining ad infinitum about several issues, especially those that plagued the community over the festive break.</p>



<p>Out-of-map exploits, cheaters, a lack of new content, and lacklustre rewards from the first Expedition Project all compounded over the last few weeks to make many players feel tired with what was being offered by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Additionally, it took the team almost a month to release the first roadmap of 2026, which includes content spanning January to April.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>







<p>It starts with new matchmaking options, fresh player projects to expand the game’s lore and quest loop, and some minor ARC threats. In February, a new Raider Deck and Expedition Project come around, and some reworks will be applied to the existing map pool.</p>



<p>However, a new map and large-scale ARC enemy aren’t appearing in ARC Raiders until<strong> April</strong>, which has left some fans of the sensational extraction adventure title a bit disappointed.</p>



<p>If the new map, which we expect will be a waterborne map arriving with Riven Tides, emerges midway through April, it will have been a gap of <strong>five months </strong>between new maps.</p>



<p>In the extraction shooter space, that’s hardly unfamiliar territory. You just need to look at Escape from Tarkov, which only adds new maps once every year or two, to get an idea of how it works. For instance, the ‘Ground Zero’ map was added to Tarkov in December 2023, and before that, Streets of Tarkov surfaced in December 2022.</p>



<p>That’s just one example.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters typically have larger, more detailed maps than your run-of-the-mill first-person shooters. It’s not like Call of Duty, which traditionally receives several new multiplayer maps once every two or three months. It’s a much bigger deal, and everything from the balancing of the map, to loot routes, to spawns, to extract locations all need to be studied and optimized at length.</p>



<p>While it might seem an issue that ARC Raiders players have to wait so long for a new map, it should be stressed that the current pool is more than large enough to facilitate an engaging session.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a problem that we’re waiting until April for a new ARC Raiders map? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-ill-never-truly-rip-until-the-seance-of-blake-manor-comes-to-switch</link>
            <guid>1415032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8773a64927b5"><a title="The Seance of Blake Manor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8773a64927b5/the-seance-of-blake-manor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spooky Doorway</em></figcaption></figure><p>Spooky Doorway is an Irish dev studio that's already brought us lucky Switch gamers some seriously good point-and-click fun times in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_-_the_series_edition">The Darkside Detective</a> series.</p>
<p>This is a studio with form, and one that's already proven it knows how to serve up clever puzzle adventures that just <em>get</em> what makes this particular genre sing. I'm talking about delicious mysteries into which to sink your teeth, mysteries that are alive with all manner of supernatural and off-kilter aspects. Stories full of weirdo characters backed up by excellent writing, perfect location choices, and gameplay that gives you enough agency that you're sucked right into the whole thing for the duration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_a_fumble_in_the_dark">A Fumble In The Dark</a>, excelled at all of this, and with sinister style to spare. So, you'll have to forgive me (and doubly so as an Irishman) if I've been ever so excited and delighted by the arrival of the team's latest game, <strong>The Séance of Blake Manor</strong>.</p>
<p>This point-and-click horror mystery is set in 1897s Ireland — Connemara to be precise — and it's their best work to date by some margin. It's a game that, had it released on Switch when it landed on PC back in October, would absolutely have been sat in the number one spot for me, over all of the other things — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-i-reviewed-25-switch-2-games-in-2025-and-these-are-my-top-3-picks">even all the Nintendo stuff (!)</a> — that I played in 2025. It's proper GOTY material, is what I'm saying, and I really, really, really (add lots more "reallys" here) want to see it come to Switch so all my Nintendo homies can get stuck into it too.</p>

<p>The titular Blake Manor is a hotel set in a remote spot in the west of Ireland, and if you've ever been to this part of the world, you'll know just how dramatic and how well lent to horror and mystery the scenery and wilderness is. Connemara is a wild and rugged spot, with its famous Twelve Pins, a range of Bens that can often be seen rising dramatically up and out of the ever-present mist of a morning - the same mist that settles over the area's many, many ancient bogs. Now add a great big Gothic hotel full of haunted stuff and weirdos, and we're in business.</p>
<p>It's the kind of place you want to set a nice big mystery like those snazzy ones with Daniel Craig in them, except make it tinged with cosmic horror and supernatural elements. It's also a setting that Spooky Doorway excels at manipulating into a story and set of puzzles that had me (a professional point-and-click expert, no less) glued to my PC monitor for the duration of my roughly 30-hour playthrough.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Private Investigator, Declan Ward, you arrive at Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of a young lady guest. It's a disappearance that's made all the more unsettling by the odd behaviour of the staff of the hotel, as well as its owner, and to add to the fun, a bunch of veteran mystics have just shown up to perform a weird Hallows' Eve ritual seance - so you're guaranteed a lot of strange conversations from the get-go.</p>
<p>It really is a delicious setup, and it's one that's carried off with aplomb, thankfully. I won't ruin it, it'd be a crime, but through interviewing suspects, keeping track of paper trails, getting stuck into all that amazing "Mind Palace" Sherlock-Holmes-style guff, solving well-designed puzzles, and exploring the labyrinthian (and secret-filled) hotel itself, you're kept more than busy.</p>

<p>Then we have the double-cherry on top of this one, the real finishing touches, in the form of a clever time management mechanic that sees your days count down as you work, adding a real sense of urgency to the entire endeavour...<em>and</em> the fact that the whole thing takes place from a first-person perspective. Oh yes, it's a real treat to explore this game from such a personal vantage point, make no mistake, and Blake Manor is brought to life in a way that wouldn't have been possible had the devs stuck with a more classic view of the genre at hand.</p>
<p>If you're into your gothic Victorian paranormal mysteries, and if you like your games stuffed to the gills with kooky characters, this one's 100% for you. By the same token, if you enjoy (or also enjoy) a bit of the auld Irish folklore and mythology — we do good folklore and mythology — and most certainly if you're into grand mysteries in the classic detective style, well, you need to play this. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>And so, I've got my rosary beads out for the lot of us. I'm praying hard for a miracle, mammy. Let's get this cracker on Switch consoles ASAP, as I reckon it's exactly the sort of thing I want to sit on my couch and play. Mostly because my TV is upstairs and I'm scared of ghosts now. And people. And stairs.</p>
<p>I reached out to Spooky Door for any word on plans for a Switch console release. No word back yet. However, perhaps they're keeping it for a surprise. Yes, yes, that's it. A surprise! Just don't go scaring me with any sudden noises if and when the announcement does finally roll around. I'm already petrified over here.</p>

              <p>Still looking for a new smartwatch for new year 2026? There are tons to choose from, of course, but we’ve found one that you’ll love using without having to spend an arm and a leg. From fitness tracking to the ability to view your messages while keeping your phone in your pocket, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 brings both form and function together to fit your needs throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/">It’s up for grabs for a great price right now, in fact. Get the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 now at Amazon.com for $169.99 (down from $249.99), a savings of $80 and approximately 32% off the retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A capable smartwatch perfect for Android users</h2>
<p>This is a great all-round smartwatch, but where it truly excels is at fitness tracking. The watch tracks your daily activity (steps taken), your heart rate and accurately monitors your workouts to give you insight into your level of physical activity. Additionally, the Galaxy Watch 7 includes sleep tracking which shows your sleep patterns and allows you to see how well you’re resting each night. If you prefer to follow guided workouts or would like reminders to stand/move throughout the day, there are tools built-in to the Galaxy Watch 7 that motivate you to remain active without being overly aggressive or annoying.</p>
<p>Battery life on the Galaxy Watch 7 is substantial for a smartwatch, so you have enough juice to last through the majority of your day and into the evening before needing to recharge. With the added benefit of wireless charging, when you need to top-up your battery life, you can simply place your watch on a compatible surface and the watch will automatically begin charging with no cables to connect or complicated adapters to worry about.</p>



<p>In addition to the health and fitness features of the Galaxy Watch 7, you’ll also be able to use the watch’s app to help you with managing your daily tasks. You can use the watch to view your calendar, respond to quick messages, and even use voice commands when your hands are occupied.</p>
<p>Another feature you may enjoy about the Galaxy Watch 7 is the ability to customize your watch face and bands to suit your individual preferences or moods. Whether you’re headed to the gym, going out for the evening, etc., you can adjust the appearance of your watch to match your style and make it more enjoyable to wear.</p>
<p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a strong contender for anyone looking to get more from their wearable device. Considering its user-friendly interface, its dependable health tracking and its array of everyday smart features, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a solid option to consider. And if you have an Android phone, it’s an even better choice for the money.</p>

The new early access trailer shows some of the combat scenarios players will enter including fist fights to full on sword, shield, and spears. Then there are the traps in each arena to take out opponents.</p>

<p>In a statement Half Sword Games said, <em>“Thank you for waiting for this extra month, we hope you rested well on your holidays and now you are ready for all the new stuff we prepared for you! <wbr>As you understand, we are still working on the game and new content will be added as we continue our way into the full release. <wbr>Bugs, performance, occasional crashes and other things are being actively ironed out as fast as our tiny team can handle. <wbr>Please, feel free to inform us of any issues that affect your immersion in the skirmishes of Half Sword.”</em></p>
<p>As a simulation game, Half Sword will test you in different battles and if you lose a fight and die, that will be the end of that run. There is no coming back from having your head lopped off after all. The game will have plenty of gore and the combat has been shaped with input from Historical European Martial Arts professionals, with each weapons impact on the body shown in the game. Each victory brings you income and a growth in reputation allowing you to buy better equipment to keep climbing the tournament ladder of 15th century Europe.</p>

			<p>Ever since <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em><strong> launched</strong> on PlayStation 5 almost two years ago, fans of the series have been wondering <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/"><strong>how different </strong></a><em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</a></strong></em> will be, both in gameplay and technical terms. While we don't yet know how the <strong>Highwind airship</strong> will shape traversing the entirety of the game's world, we have now learned something that is sure to make many breathe a sigh of relief: <strong>the game won't use Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking with <strong>Gamespot</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the engine powering part 3. <em>"We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. <em>"It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs."</em></p>



<p>Previously, Hamaguchi-san revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/"><strong>development team was considering switching to Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part 3, which made more than a few shudder at the thought of the stuttering issues that would likely have plagued the experience, especially on PC. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 4</strong> will be an even more dated engine by the time the game comes out, so the game's visuals may leave<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> something to be desired</strong> compared to open-world games set to release in the future such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong></a></em>, which will fully leverage the engine's unique features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lumen</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nanite</strong>. Still, this could result in an easier Nintendo Switch 2 port and less demanding system specifications on PC so there's some clear pros and cons to the choice. </p>



<p>Hopefully, the customized engine powering the game will address this graphical fidelity gap and deliver excellent visuals befitting the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>



<p>With <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></a></em> having released this month on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series X|S</strong> this month and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/"><strong><em>Rebirth</em> set to do the same later this year</strong></a>, the series has returned to the spotlight, and now even more gamers are anticipating the reveal of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whose name has finally been decided. </p>



<p>If the game is aiming to <strong>release in time with the original's 35th anniversary</strong> in 2027, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>it will likely not take too long</strong></a> to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of a series that, for better or worse, is set to influence the entire franchise in the future.</p>
