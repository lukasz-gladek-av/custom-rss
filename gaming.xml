            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9eb7087658715"><a title="Haunted Chocolatier" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9eb7087658715/haunted-chocolatier.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all excited to see what Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is cooking up with <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong>, the upcoming life sim where you run a chocolate shop with the help of ghosts, and ConcernedApe's second game after the mammoth hit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>But things are taking a little while, which is causing some fans to get a little concerned. But Barone has assured fans that he's "still working like always" in a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">blog post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-shuts-down-rumors-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-abandoned-insisting-it-will-come-out-when-its-ready">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Addressing those concerns directly, Barone says, "Yep, it’s taking a while to finish the game. That’s okay", but acknowledges that he may have gotten ahead of himself revealing the game when he did: "I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons."</p>
<p>The rest of the blog post looks at some of the general chatter and "false assumptions" that have been going around fan communities over the years, all of which Barone dismisses.</p>
<p>One assumption that has been going around is that Haunted Chocolatier will be abandoned and instead will just be added onto Stardew Valley — a game that has been getting regular updates since its release in 2017, as recently as December 2025 with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>"No. First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier. But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley" Barone writes, saying that wouldn't even make sense "from a technical perspective. "Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same “engine” as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley."</p>

<p>Then, sticking with the Stardew angle, some have wondered whether the Stardew Valley updates are actually tests for Haunted Chocolatier. "Nope", says Barone. "When working on Stardew Valley, I’m not thinking about Haunted Chocolatier, and vice versa."</p>
<p>Again, he reiterates that Stardew Valley "is a different game" and that the content isn't compatible between the two. Not only that, Barone doesn't want to spoil many of his ideas in the upcoming game. Understandable!</p>
<p>So, why does Stardew keep getting updates? Is it because "he's burnt out on Haunted Chocolatier"? You can probably imagine the answer already; "No, I’m working on a new Stardew update because it’s a very popular game with a large, ever-growing playerbase, and I still have additional ideas for how to improve it."</p>
<p>The game doesn't have a release date yet, and Barone is sticking to that — while some have interpreted from comments that it's coming in 2030, Barone dismisses that. " I was asked in 2025 if it would come out within the next five years, and I said “I hope so”.</p>

<p>As he's stressed throughout the process, and this blog post, "The game will come out when it's done". So we'll just have to be patient.</p>
<p>And, honestly? We're happy to wait. Barone does share occasional updates on social media, and we're still amazed we're getting constant free content for Stardew Valley all these years later.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">some regions are still waiting for the Switch 2 version</a> after it initially launched with some pretty big bugs, but most of these are fixed at this point, with a handful of stragglers still to iron out. if you have a North American eShop account, you can still download the Switch 2 Edition for free (if you own the game on Switch 1). It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">still fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-donrt-want-to-see-it-fizzle-outr-stardew-valley-creator-on-why-he-cant-give-it-up">we spoke to Barone in late 2024</a>, he spoke about what he wanted to do differently compared to Stardew: "Designing bosses is a whole new ball game from anything that's Stardew. And I think I wanted something different. I wanted a challenge because I want to keep growing as a game developer. I didn't want to just do exactly the same thing again."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft recently unleashed a raft of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancellations, delays and studio closures</a> as part of a brutal bout of corporate restructuring. We've still yet to see how all of the repercussions of it will go, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposed voluntary redundancies</a> at the company's Paris headquarters having seen unions put plans in place for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">three day strike in February</a>.</p>
<p>One of the games which wasn't among the cancellations was long-in-development sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>, and its director has now confirmed as much, offering a brief message to reassure fans and encourage folks to support devs affected by Ubisoft's bloodletting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft," Fawzi Mesmar wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7421227406130335744-io3s">LinkedIn</a>. "Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone - myself included - to offer support whenever and however they can during these times. We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy."</p><p>He also directed folks to consult the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">official docs</a> for more info on Ubisoft's restructure, which has seen the Beyond Good and Evil series slotted into the fourth of five "creative houses". House number four is all about "immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes", with Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, and Prince of Persia filling it out.</p>
<p>It's great to hear Mesmar's team haven't been hit by layoffs as a result of changes, at least as of yet, though it is worth noting that we don't know the exact number of folks who're working on Beyond Good and Evil 2 at the moment. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-didnt-cancel-beyond-good-evil-2-because-open-world-games-are-a-priority-but-i-suspect-the-real-reason-is-more-boring">Edwin wrote the other week</a>, the official reason that's been given for BG&amp;E2 keeping on keeping on while the likes of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake were condemned to history is Ubisoft's desire to keep doing open world things.</p>
<p>My non-money expert also speculated that there might be boring accounting reasons why the company might want to keep this specific game in the works for now, essentially boiling down to it being more useful to them alive and with potential to make some money in the eyes of investors, rather than written off as a cash black hole.</p>
<p>The truth, as it's been for a while, is that none of the above will become truly crystal clear until finally we get more details about/a chance to play Beyond Good and Evil 2, or Ubisoft announce they're pulling the plug. For now, it remains Schrödinger's anthropomorphic animal action-adventure.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gdc-2026-survey-ai-union-layoff-xbox-ps5-trump-2000664245</link>
            <guid>1421011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2026 Game Developers Conference (GDC), which has been renamed the GDC Festival of Gaming, takes place in early March. Ahead of the San Francisco-based industry event, GDC has released <a href="https://kotaku.com/gdc-2025-developer-survey-generative-ai-pc-switch-2-1851744292/2">its annual survey of game industry developer sentiment</a>. Over 2,300 industry professionals responded on topics ranging from genAI to layoffs, providing a small snapshot of what’s going on across video game companies big and small. It’s not a pretty picture.</p> <h2>A majority of game developers now think genAI will hurt the game industry</h2> <p>Back in 2024, game makers were relatively split on the advantages and downsides of the emerging LLM craze. Now they are increasingly horrified by it. Last year, 13 percent of respondents <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">thought genAI</a> would have a positive impact on the game industry. In 2026 it’s just 7 percent. Instead, 52 percent think the technology will have a negative impact, up double digits from just 12 months ago. Artists, storytellers, programmers–they’re all down on it. Still, actual adoption of the technology for things as simple as writing emails is growing.</p>

 <h2>Developers are bailing on making games for Xbox</h2> <p>According to the new survey, roughly 40 percent of respondents said they were interested in making their next game for PlayStation 5 or Switch 2. Only 20 percent were planning to bring it to Xbox Series X/S. That’s still above Android, iOS, and the original Switch, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">it’s a steep drop-off</a> from last year when the Xbox number was 34 percent. PC is still far and away the most popular platform. Maybe that’s why Microsoft is pivoting to it.</p> <h2>Union support is surging</h2> <p>Over 80 percent of U.S.-based developers told the survey they support unionization, with 62 percent saying they were interested in joining one. Those numbers show there’s likely room for <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">many more game studios to organize</a>, as only 13 percent of respondents said they’re actually currently in a union. Union drives have been sweeping through Microsoft-owned subsidiaries thanks to a neutrality clause the company previously agreed to, but unions have struggled to take hold at many other big publishers like Electronic Arts and 2K Games.</p>

 <h2>A third of U.S. developers said they were laid off in the last two years</h2> <p>That’s a devastating number which shows that the full impact of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">recent downsizing spree</a> will still be with the industry for years to come. Meanwhile, 17 percent of respondents said they were laid off within the last 12 months, a steady annual increase over the previous two years. Even worse, nearly 50 percent of people laid off weren’t able to find another job in the video game industry during that time.</p>

 <h2>Trump take game</h2> <p>The administration’s trade war and anti-immigrant crackdown appears to be taking <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">a real toll on the game industry</a>. According to the survey, 31 percent of respondents canceled travel plans to the U.S. while another third are currently reconsidering future travel. A whopping 60 percent of non-U.S. industry leaders said the policies had negatively impacted their desire to conduct business based in the country. On the trade side, 38 percent of respondents said tariffs had impacted their financial decisions.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Biggest Upcoming Soulslike Games In 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/</link>
            <guid>1421008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Soulslike genre is a beautiful and bullishly difficult genre of games. FromSoftware created a monster when it unleashed Demon’s Souls onto the world, and everyone is trying their hand at Soulslike games in 2026.</p>



<p>Trying to explain the joys of playing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/soulslike/" id="989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> game must sound like sadism to the uninformed and uninitiated. Souls games offer an unprecedented level of triumph seldom seen in any other type of game, and it’s why they continue to keep coming out. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elden-ring/" id="135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a> brought the Soulslike genre into the mainstream, and many more are lined up for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-hardest-soulslikes-releasing-that-you-must-play-in-2026">Hardest Soulslikes Releasing That You Must Play In 2026</h2>



<p>As with all lists, make room for the possibility of a delay or two. Everything on this list is expected to come out in 2026, and Insider Gaming will have news on any delays or further announcements, like always. Without further ado, these are the 7 games identified as must-play and must-own Souls games in 2026—also known as must-have-spare-controllers-on-standby titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-beast-of-reinacarnation">Beast of Reinacarnation</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Game Freak</figcaption></figure>



<p>Who’d have ever guessed that the primary driving force behind Pokémon games would venture off into a completely different, Soulslike direction? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beast-of-reincarnation-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" id="171386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a> was fully revealed during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beast-of-reincarnation-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, and one thing that immediately became apparent was its Soulsy nature. Its beautiful environments could be ripped from Pokémon Sword and Shield or Scarlet and Violet, but its combat veers violently away from tiny elemental creatures to awe-inspiring bosses with a high level of difficulty. Beast of Reincarnation holds a lot of promise and is easily one of 2026’s most intriguing games, let alone Soulslikes.</p>







<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have Hidetaka Miyazaki to thank for the hours you’ve spent curled up on the couch, unable to beat a Soulslike boss, or dying for the 137th time to a poisonous swamp. Now, FromSoftware’s company president, Miyazaki, and his team have spawned a new potential franchise—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/the-duskbloods/" id="108378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>. It’s launching as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, but there’s nothing family-friendly about its action. It changes up the formula slightly with PvPvE action; however, based on what we’ve seen, the gameplay looks as unforgiving as ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s so good to have Nioh back. There was nothing wrong with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty or Rise of the Ronin, but Nioh has an unrivalled vibe that hits harder than a One-Eyed Oni who’s just lost his favorite monocle. Patience is certainly KI in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-review-embargo-date/" id="172692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>, and the third mainline game brings back all the devilishly difficult action that Team Ninja specializes in. Expect a quality product that can go toe-to-toe with any competitor that dares to step up.</p>



<h3 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to HEXWORKS</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there’s one Soulslike franchise that is still trying to find its breakout moment, it’s probably Lords of the Fallen. It took nine years for Lords of the Fallen to get a sequel, and 2023’s bizarrely also self-titled game was hit and miss with many. Lords of the Fallen 2 looks big, it looks badder (in a good way), and fingers crossed that HEXWORKS has finally found the missing piece of the puzzle in Lords of the Fallen 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-mortal-shell-2">Mortal Shell 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Cold Symmetry</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your mileage may vary, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mortal-shell-2/" id="3537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Shell</a> is seen as a more accessible Souls game. It’s still not easy by any means, and it may have played things a bit safe. Cold Symmetry heard this, took the feedback on board, and came back all guns (more swords in this case) blazing with Mortal Shell 2’s heavy-metal-thumping announcement trailer in June 2025. Gruesome kill animations and a mean attitude could be symptomatic of a game that wants to brush off the Dark Souls comparisons to feel like something fresh and fun.</p>



<h3 id="h-valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to One More Level</figcaption></figure>



<p>A first-person Soulslike should be a winner on paper. It’s a mystery why no one’s thought to go down this avenue, but developer One More Level is looking to ascend to that next step of greatness, following the energy-charged Ghostrunner games. Insider Gaming sat down for an exclusive hour-long playtest, and as the person who did it, I raved about it and went as far as calling it: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Most Promising Soulslike in Years</a>.” Its seamless blend of Bioshock-like action and esoteric Soulslike mechanics and principles makes it accessible and equally satisfying and punishing. One of 2026’s hottest prospects lurks beneath the Napoleonic nuances.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-relic-first-guardian">The Relic: First Guardian</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Project Cloud Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speediness and swiftness have been at the heart of a lot of what’s been shown from The Relic: First Guardian. It’s probably gotten the least hype of anything in this list, but that doesn’t mean it won’t deliver. It looks wonderfully atmospheric, and this is your first call to pay attention to it. Who knows, it could be your next Soulslie darling without you ever knowing it.</p>



<p>There are other Soulslike-adjacent games like Phatnom Blade Zero coming out in 2026, but are there any distinct Souls games missing from this list?

After being shut out of the Noteworthy Song Contest, Cadence realizes that her solo act might not be enough for the judges! As she sets off to form her band, she quickly gets caught up in events far grander, and more dangerous, than she could have possibly imagined.</li><li><strong>Fret</strong> (voiced by Jason Charles Miller) – Fret is the old guy who’s seen it all, and a prototypical classic rocker. He misses his old band, and lives a solo act kind of life in Durandis, the Kingdom of Rock and Roll.</li><li><strong>Synthia</strong> (voiced by Erika Ishii / vocals by Amanda Angeles) – Synthia is the introverted extrovert. Normally quiet and reclusive around even their closest friends, this DJ sheds that persona when they get in front of the one’s and two’s; though they harbor doubts about whether or not they really deserve their renown.</li><li><strong>Vox</strong> (voiced by Mansa “Wakil” Wakili) – Vox is living in his mother’s shadow. The son of Caliq, the regent of Pyre, he’s calm, logical, and thinks rap music should be about more than battling…but he’ll learn that sometimes, you need to fight to protect what you love.</li><li><strong>Cerrin</strong> (voiced by Marwan Salama) – Cerrin’s a bit of a dork, polite and respectful, but there’s a buried part of him that doesn’t mind bending the rules for a good cause.</li><li><strong>Arc</strong> (voiced by Alex Boniello) – On the outside, Arc is smart, flirtatious at times, and resentful of any sort of injustice. On the inside, he bears the emotional scars of his upbringing as an unorthodox prodigy in an oppressive environment. Always with just a hint of a smirk, Arc always knows a little more than he’s letting on.</li><li><strong>Sharp ♯</strong> (voiced by Joe Zieja) – Fantastically egotistical and snobby, Sharp believes that 80s music, and his music in particular, is what all music should be. He’s transparently fake, a “man of the people” who can’t stand the people. And as the manager of Smolder, Chordia’s hottest boy band, he seems to have some ulterior motives…</li><li><strong>Anthony</strong> (voiced by <a title="Games > Griffin [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/griffin">Griffin</a> Burns) – The front man of Smolder, Chordia’s top charting boy band. He’s the most recognizable figure in pop;. handsome, self-assured, and weirdly oblivious, he also happens to be holder of the Chordian Key of Note, a very interesting artifact but for him, it’s just an accessory to his outfit really.</li><li><strong>Lasso</strong> (voiced by Sean Kenin Elias-Reyes / vocals by Drew Rider Smith) – Lasso is the rough-and-tumble leader of the Homestead, nation of country music. A convincing leader with a commanding presence, Lasso doesn’t necessarily enjoy violence, but he understands that sometimes you just don’t have a choice.</li><li><strong>Martell</strong> (voiced by Debra Wilson) – Martell is the Homestead’s second in command, and a fearsome foe in her own right. A mature woman, Martell takes her country roots seriously. Beautiful and dangerous, she wields Homestead politeness like a sharpened scalpel–her family motto is “Bless Your Heart.”</li><li><strong>Annette</strong> (voiced by Erica Lindbeck / vocals by Elizabeth Zharoff) – The diva of all divas, Annette is the lead performer in the Archaia Grand Opera, an institution older than most nations’ full histories. While one of the most musically talented singers in all of Note, she’d never dream of taking the stage without her lucky pearls in hand!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>A tease has been made by Blizzard for something special for Classic World of Warcraft players. Meanwhile, the Classic World of Warcraft community is polling itself to find out what they'd want from some sort of 'Classic+'.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkFMkdZWxdk">In the 2026 State of Azeroth presentation</a>, hosted by executive producer Holly Longdale, went over everything in the pipeline across both retail (modern) and Classic World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>On the topic of Classic WoW, Longdale stated the following before being playfully cut off. She stated: "I can say with confidence that all Classic players across the globe have a lot to look forward to. I'm excited to announce…" before being cut off with "Holly No!".</p>

<p>This continues <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247148/2025-blizzard-yearbook">a trend of recent hints</a> at something substantial coming to Classic World of Warcraft, which has been presumed by swathes of the audience to be some sort of expansion of content to Classic World of Warcraft. Dubbed 'Classic+' by the community, this would be a sort of Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> style strand of WoW in which new updates can be produced in the Classic style.</p><p>This tease comes at an interesting time, as a community-run initiative called 'The Classic+ Project' recently was released. This project has manifested initially as a survey website and Discord server, prompting players to vote on what they'd like to see added and changed to Classic WoW.</p>
<p>Announced in a video by creator Joardee titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWq2SFSI3zY">What Exactly is Classic+</a>', this project was created to pull together sentiment by players directly at a time when Blizzard is keeping its cards to its chest.</p>
<p>So discussion around Classic + is really reaching somewhat of a crescendo. Will Blizzard finally announce some form of Classic +, and will this community project refine the wants of the masses into a solid list of wants? If there's any time to announce something official, it's Blizzcon later this year.</p>

			<p><strong>MindsEye </strong>developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has <strong>ended its publishing deal</strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">Hitman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a></strong> developer <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/">Insider-Gaming</a>. MindsEye was the first game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive published under its new publishing label</a>, and it might just be its last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">if reports from <strong>last year</strong></a>, and now this, are to be believed. </p>



<p>That said, according to the report, the decision to end the deal came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, not IO Interactive. This is said to come from Build a Rocket Boy wanting to start publishing its games internally and ultimately have more control over its future. This also reportedly means that the previously planned MindsEye and Hitman collaboration has been cancelled.</p>



<p>Now that 2025 is in the books, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has more GOTY awards than any other game before it</a>, if you were wondering what's at the opposite end of the spectrum, that would be MindsEye, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">at least according to Metacritic</a>. Only earning a <strong>37</strong>, it was the <strong>worst-reviewed game of 2025</strong>, after it had a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">disastrous launch</a></strong>.</p>



<p>To say it was an extremely bug-plagued game at launch would be an understatement. It was bad enough that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation gave players refunds</a></strong> because the game was so broken. And when it was working, critics and players hammered the lack of anything to do and its less-than-enticing story.</p>



<p>It was a bad situation for Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">The game didn't have the worst sales launch,</a> all things considered, but the word-of-mouth and the barrage of memes and clips of the game's worst moments killed any momentum the team at Build a Rocket Boy could have had. The studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">suffered layoffs</a>,</strong> and developers called out the studio leadership, which included former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">damning open letter</a>.</p>



<p>An even more <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">damning report from the BBC a week later</a> revealed more about the internal issues at Build a Rocket Boy, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">while the studio has tried to update and fix the game</a>, it feels more likely that it will run out of financial runway and get shut down before it has a chance to see its full vision for MindsEye realized.</p>



<p>Considering all of this, it's interesting that the report indicates the decision to cut ties came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, and not IO Interactive. Maybe this is because Build a Rocket Boy has a comeback plan it wants full autonomy over. We'll see if that's the case, though it's worth noting that so far, neither Build a Rocket Boy or IO Interactive have officially confirmed or denied this report.</p>

            <guid>1420954</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and what better way to show your love than flowers that you can build together and never have to replace? We’re talking about LEGO roses, which aren’t just a sweet gesture, but also look incredibly beautiful and require zero upkeep.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">If you haven’t picked a gift up yet, or are looking for a second one, the LEGO Roses set is available for just under $10 at Amazon, after a nice $5 discount</a>. It’s a great time to grab one without overspending, and even pick up a few, because a bouquet never hurts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Quick to Build</h2>
<p>It’s not one of those massive builds that takes days and weeks to complete. LEGO keeps it short and sweet with this one. You’re getting a total of just 120 pieces, which come together to make two beautiful roses with adjustable stems. The stem of each rose measures over 10 in. (26 cm) long, so it’s perfect for displaying in a vase. You can plan a cute LEGO date around building these with your partner, while also asking each other thoughtful questions for a meaningful conversation, or go down memory lane together. Maybe stream a cute, romantic movie as you build – the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>These are great as Valentine’s Day gifts, but also make a thoughtful present for Mother’s Day, Women’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries. You can even treat yourself to a set because hey, you need to appreciate yourself too.</p>



<p>Building these is pretty straightforward. The set comes with a detailed instruction booklet that takes you through each step one-by-one. The book includes visuals to assist you, which makes the process even easier. LEGO also has its own building app – the LEGO Builder – which offers 3D instructions. You can zoom in on the blocks from each angle to understand the steps better. The app also lets you track your progress, build with friends, and save sets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">You can now grab the LEGO Roses set for just under $10, after Amazon took $5 off its usual $15 price.</a> If you’re open to spending a bit more, it’s also worth checking out other sets in LEGO’s Botanical collection. Several options are discounted right now, so you can mix and match flowers for a fuller, more colorful bouquet!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1420951</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over a quarter of a century after the initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is putting a fresh lick of paint and a new look on the classic title, with gamers across various platforms able to enjoy the game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on February 5</a>, though players can jump in up to 48 hours early by purchasing the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to purchase Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and want to know what options are available in terms of platforms, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-ps5">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Options. Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is available to play on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on the February 5 release date, with two options available.</strong></p>



<p>The Standard Edition of the game comes with an additional bonus of a Blue Slime Shield, and those who want to splash out on the Digital Deluxe Edition receive 48 hours of early access, The Road of Regal Wretches, Luminary’s Livery, and the White Wolf Costume.</p>



<p>Of course, that extra content comes at a price, and the biggest incentive is the early access period if you can’t wait for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S</a>, with the same purchase options as PS5.</strong></p>



<p>None of the bonuses in the Digital Deluxe Edition is platform-exclusive, so Xbox players can get their hands on the same loot as PS5 players, including entry into the 48-hour early-access period.</p>



<p>There is also an Early Bird Bonus for those who purchase the game before March 4, 2026, providing the Trodain Togs outfit and three Seed of Proficiency.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined lands at the same time on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles as on other platforms, with the same purchase options.</strong></p>



<p>This includes the 48-hour early-access period for purchasing the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, though the biggest bonus for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> players is that the game is available on that platform too, as it is not a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/huntdown-overtime-is-a-goofy-retro-and-delightfully-violent-roguelike-ign-game-preview</link>
            <guid>1420948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I confess that I had never heard of 2020’s pixelated arcade shooter Huntdown, but after playing (and replaying) through the demo for its upcoming prequel, Huntdown: Overtime, I immediately went back and did so. That’s because I was so completely hooked by the hour or so of roguelike action that I was fiending for more. Playing the original was also a lot of fun, but this followup seeks to improve in just about every way, making it a bit hard to go back. The cheeky retro ‘80’s tone appeals to my thirst for nonsense, the run-and-gun sidescrolling action channels the likes of Contra or Metal Slug, and the roguelike system of upgrades and repeated failure against daunting odds made it extremely hard to put down. I went from this not being on my radar at all, to eagerly anticipating when it comes to Steam Early Access later this year, making this an early contender for my most anticipated indie game of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can infer almost everything you need to know about Huntdown: Overtime’s absurd 80s pulp action vibe by its title alone. Taking place in the dystopian, crime-ridden city of Detroit in 2084, you play a cybernetic rogue robocop who battles against flamboyant street gangs like something out of every VHS action movie you’ve ever seen. You’ll go toe-to-toe against the likes of a shirtless bouncer who pummels you with his fists and climbs around on the ceiling like a monkey, to a six-fingered rockstar called Sammy Sixfingers who tries to kill you with an electric guitar while performing a guitar solo in front of a live audience. The whole thing is just incredibly over the top in the right kind of way, making it very easy to replay each section as you try and fail to get through levels in typical roguelike fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly helps that even when you’re replaying through the same series of levels, things are always a little different. For one, the bosses and levels you end up with on each run have a bit of randomness to them in terms of which you’ll get and in what order, which is aided by the fact that you’re given two routes to choose from if you’d like to avoid one you’ve seen more of than you’d like. The levels themselves seem to be procedurally generated as well, and kept me on my toes with slightly different layouts and enemies never appearing in the same order. This procedural component isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, and the level layouts and enemies you’ll find are similar enough playthrough-to-playthrough that you’ll figure out the patterns pretty quick and run out of things to be surprised by (at least in the short section I played).</p><p>It actually sort of reminded me of Hotline Miami, reimagined from a sidescrolling perspective.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also not anything new, modeled after the likes of Contra or Mega Man, where you’re running and jumping through 2D levels blasting everytc hing in sight as you avoid incoming bullets and environmental hazards. That said, though it doesn’t have many new tricks, the formula it apes is extremely polished here, even in this pre-release state. While initially I was dying a lot and felt destined to be outmaneuvered by the numerous gangsters coming after me, it took less than an hour before I was sliding around, flying through the air, and shooting my way through entire sections without taking a single hit. That’s the kind of rewarding mastery I look for in games like this. It actually sort of reminded me of Hotline Miami, reimagined from a sidescrolling perspective, because although you can take more than one hit, there’s something very pleasantly familiar about the crisp gunplay and melee combat, especially when you hit someone with a baseball bat and see their pink, pixelated giblets go soaring across the screen.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Huntdown: Overtime – First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The highlight of each run is when you come into contact with the larger-than-life bosses that can be found in each level. Some of these appear in regular sidescrolling levels, whe  re maybe someone named Frankie Starsimmon Sr. will attack you with a big ol’ shotgun and leave you with the option to damage her before taking her alive, or just killing her for a lesser bounty. The ability to take bounties alive for an added bonus to your reward is a particularly nice touch that I’m glad to see they added after the original. But things get especially crazy during the boss fights where you go up against someone with a dedicated boss health bar. The main fight in the demo was against a rockstar who used his stage’s pyrotechnics to try and burn you alive, and always had his stagehand nearby to hand him a new electric guitar after he lost the last one trying to hurl it through the back of your head. These fights can be really challenging, as roguelikes are wont to do, and nine times out of ten when I failed a run it was the fault of one of these deadly weirdos. But they were also some of my favorite moments, and made gearing up for the next big fight that much more exciting.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The retreaded ground you’ll encounter as part of the roguelike formula feels especially easy to get through because of the steady stream of unlockables, upgrades, and buildcrafting options that come with each new playthrough. In one playthrough, for example, you might decide to forgo guns for a pure melee weapon build, grabbing perks and upgrades that enhance your close-range combat skills, while in another you might get your hands on a new plasma rifle you just unlocked and blast your way through rows of thugs with ease. Like many of its genre peers, the joy is in having a build come together perfectly so you can bring it to bear against the string of challenging bosses that have been sending you back to the beginning again and again. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/29/screenshot-3-1769730902329.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The impressive thing about Huntdown: Overtime is that, at least in the full region I played during the demo, I never started a new run without a ton of new stuff to level up and try out. Sometimes that meant I’d unlock a new weapon that could then be found and powered up during runs, while other times it meant buying a certain permanent upgrade that made my healing items more potent, made me move faster, or some other useful boon to give me an edge on my next run. The pace of unlocks and progression felt perfectly balanced so I never felt like I’d hit a wall or had nothing interesting and new to bring into battle next time. It was so easy to immediately go from one run to the next, that even though I originally sat down for a 20-minute session, I ended up playing until I beat every boss in the demo in a single sitting, completely unable to tear myself away when I was sure the next playthrough would bring me victory. And even after I had my first successful run, I then was returned to base to find even more stuff had unlocked that I just had to try, and found myself immediately going straight into my next run just to try out some new stuff. I can’t remember the last time I found myself so instantly hooked!</p><p>Even though I originally sat down for a 20-minute session, I ended up playing until I beat every boss in the demo in a single sitting, completely unable to tear myself away.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that piqued my interest after I went back to play the original Huntdown is the fact that this prequel only has one playable character versus the numerous agents you could take on the role of in the first game. While it feels weird to go backwards with the number of playable characters, Overtime’s demo was so polished and finely tuned that I honestly didn’t feel like I was missing much. It seems to be their focusing in on one specific playstyle and trying to make that work extremely well vs. the buffet-style protagonists, each with their own bag of tricks, that was in the first Huntdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting to end up so completely won over by such a short glimpse into Huntdown: Overtime, especially after seeing its dorky story and retro art style, but you can count me among the believers. For any roguelike fans out there, this is absolutely one to watch.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/huntdown-overtime-is-a-goofy-retro-and-delightfully-violent-roguelike-ign-game-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Google has begun selling access to Project Genie, an interactive world creation tool that lets you generate playable environments from a prompt — including those featuring Nintendo characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The technology is certainly remarkable, as Google's Genie 3 models playable 3D spaces in real time based upon user inputs, and allows you to run, swim, fly, or ride in vehicles around its AI-generated worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the AI technology has also launched with a telling lack of restrictions around copyrighted material — which the model also appears to have been trained upon. A preview of the possibilities published by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> shows its reporter able to create playable 3D scenes that look a direct copy of Super Mario 64, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and Kingdom Hearts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Step inside Project Genie: our experimental research prototype that lets you create, edit, and explore virtual worlds. 🌎 <a href="https://t.co/HQr1FRNlpy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HQr1FRNlpy</a></p>— Google DeepMind (@GoogleDeepMind) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2016919756440240479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 29, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Footage published on social media shows gameplay clearly based on Nintendo's actual Breath of the Wild, where a knock-off Link runs around a world similar to Hyrule, and accurately deploys a glider as he leaps off a cliff.

Still, Google is selling access as part of its Google AI Ultra subscription, its top level of access to AI features that costs $124.99 per month when signing up for a three-month package. (Also, Project Genie access is currently just for U.S. subscribers aged 18 or over.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides," Google Deepmind product manager Diego Rivas told The Verge when asked why the the product generated material that was clearly based on Nintendo intellectual property. "As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback." The Verge noted that its ability to generate worlds based on Mario had subsequently been halted, with a warning message that blamed the "interests of third-party content providers." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation feels reminiscent to the rollout of OpenAI's Sora 2 video model last October, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-dont-sue-me-sora-2-app-opens-floodgates-to-ai-videos-of-pikachu-mario-and-more">initially allowed users to generate clips featuring licensed Nintendo and Disney characters</a>, including Mario, Darth Vader, Pikachu and an array of other Pokémon.

		<p>Wildlight Entertainment has released patch 1.0.4 for its free to play hero shooter Highguard, with the update adding field of view sliders for console players, and addressed some bug and crash issues. Highguard was released earlier this week and since launch the game has received a mixed response. You can check out Highguard update 1.0.4 patch notes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Launch Trailer | Highguard" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Highguard 1.0.4 update patch notes</h2>

<p><i>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English. Properly localized settings will be prepared for a future patch.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.<wbr></li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.<wbr></li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.<wbr></li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new “View Distance Quality” setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials<wbr></li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration<wbr></li>
<li>Bloom<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</i><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.&nbsp;<i>More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</i><wbr></li>
<li>Players can now select&nbsp;<i>Off</i>&nbsp;to disable Global Illumination entirely.<wbr></li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Crash and Bug Fixes</b><wbr></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.<wbr></li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90%, significantly improving stability.<wbr></li>
<li>Friend status is fixed – players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90% crash reduction.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard Review in Progress</a></h2>
<p>While we haven’t got a full review for Highguard yet, Dom gave some early impressions saying, <em>“Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>

              <p>The Pokémon Company has issued an apology after a listing appeared on its official site for a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> event said to be taking place at the Yasukuni Shrine. This controversial site has repeatedly caused consternation in Japan when visited by political figures, and even by previous Pokémon employees, and once again people were upset to see the location listed as the site of a TCG tournament.</p> <p>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the Japanese people who died in conflicts from 1869 to 1954, and thus includes the soldiers who died as part of Japan’s forces fighting for the Axis powers in World War II, many of whom were charged with the most serious of war crimes. As such, it’s a very controversial site, both within and without the country, and it causes serious stirs whenever anyone of prominence chooses to make a public visit. Indeed, The Pokémon Company discovered this for itself in 2019 when a number of employees from Creatures visited the Shinto shrine for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde"><i>hatsumōde</i></a>.</p>

 <p>Given its hugely complicated politics and the controversies that arise every time it’s visited, TPC clearly doesn’t want it used as the site of a <em>PTCG</em> event. However, live events are added to the company’s site by those with an official <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Play certification, rather than by TPC itself. It works the same all around the world—if you want to find a local Play event near you, <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/?locale=en-us">you can look them up on the U.S. version of the site</a>. So it seems someone with such a certification in Japan added the event to the vast numbers listed for the country.</p> <p>“On the event search page of the ‘Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website’ operated by our company,” <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/368.html">begins a statement on&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s corporate site</a> (via machine translation), “information about an event scheduled to be held at Yasukuni Shrine was posted.” The statement goes on to call allowing this Yasukuni Shrine event to be listed the result of a “lack of due diligence,” adding, “even though it should not have been held in the first place.”</p>

 <p>The event was canceled once discovered, say TPC, adding an apology (again, via machine translation). “We have received feedback and opinions from various parties since the information about this event was released, and we sincerely apologize for this.” The company adds that it will “fundamentally change and strengthen the review system and confirmation process for event information” to prevent something like this happening again.</p>

<p>Over 25 years since its initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined provides players with a huge modernization of the classic game, and the release date is right around the corner.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> title was a huge hit when it was initially released at the turn of the millennium, and the remastered version is one of the most eagerly anticipated titles releasing in the early part of 2026.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for all the release date and start time details for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-release-date">What is The Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back again. Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is set for launch on February 5, though the date may vary based on your region and the platform you are playing on.</strong></p>



<p>For those that purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition, 48 hours of early access are available as an incentive.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimaged is available across multiple platforms, but the release time and date vary across them; however, for the vast majority, it will be February 5 when you can start playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-start-times">What Are The Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>The start time for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined varies based on platform, with a 12 AM PT release on consoles, and a 9 AM PT release on Steam.</strong> <strong>Those with early access can jump in up to 48 hours before these times. </strong></p>



<p>As is customary for platforms like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, Dragon Quest VII Reimaged has a staggered release date, which means that you can play early in your time zone if you adjust your settings accordingly, which is very easy to do on Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Skyrim Lead Says Elder Scrolls TV Show Wouldn’t Work]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/</link>
            <guid>1420906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has seen immense success with the delivery of the Fallout television show. It has won awards, pulled millions of eyes to the Fallout universe, and opened the door to collaborations across the ecosystem. But would that success roll over into The Elder Scrolls if <strong>that franchise </strong>were to be adapted into a live-action production?</p>



<p>According to Bruce Nesmith, former design lead on The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim, and a quest writer on Fallout 3 (amongst other things), a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls <strong>probably wouldn’t work</strong>.</p>











<p>Nesmith worked at Bethesda Game Studios for several years, leaving in 2021 to chase new horizons. But before he departed, he offered key contributions to some of the company’s most ambitious projects, including 2011’s Elder Scrolls game, <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/">Skyrim</a></strong>. It’s widely considered one of the best games ever made, and he played a pivotal part in bringing it to life.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Box PR</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and the world around him and what he has created – and continues to create.</p>



<p>One segment turned to talking about the Fallout TV show and the success it has seen since debuting in April 2024.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked Nesmith if he could see The Elder Scrolls receiving the live-action treatment, but the former Bethesda Game Studios developer was sceptical and pretty on the money with his opinion:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Do they really need marketing for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>



<p>There’s something very special and different and unique about Fallout that lends itself to becoming a TV or movie experience whereas The Elder Scrolls is trying to be a standard kind of fantasy. That’s not as interesting.</p>



<p>You look at Fallout, everything is special about it. There is nothing like the Fallout universe anywhere else in gaming.</p>



<p>That makes it easy to make a TV show and draw eyeballs as opposed to going into a fantasy world where I’ve got elves and people throwing spells around. You’d have to raise those stakes. There’s a dragon? I’ve seen dragons 20 times before. What are you giving to viewers that’s new?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know that The Elder Scrolls would fit that media well. Maybe a movie but I would struggle to see a TV show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a good point. Nesmith pointed to brands like Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, which could be seen as very Elder Scrolls-coded. There are plenty of television shows and movies with fantasy themes, even adaptations like The Witcher walk a close line to the Bethesda-backed brand, for instance.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely Bethesda Game Studios will turn anything other than Fallout into a show, especially as the series could run <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">for up to a <strong>decade</strong></a>, all being well.</p>



<p>Now, if we could just start talking about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making Fallout 5 a reality</a>…</p>

			<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> is due to have its third <strong>Nintendo Direct event</strong> of the year <strong>next week</strong> on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026</strong>, and it'll be a <strong>Partner Showcase Direct</strong>, if multiple reports surrounding this rumour are to be believed.</p>



<p>After first coming from known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">NateTheHate</a> (who has also predicted that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/"><strong>PlayStation State of Play</strong> is on the horizon for <strong>February</strong></a>), their report about a coming Nintendo Direct was corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">GameXplain</a>, who then added that it would be a Partner Showcase, which was corroborated by NateTheHate, and as of today, both rumours have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>Next Thursday is the predicted date, and if it is indeed a Partner Showcase, that means we can only expect to see <strong>third-party related</strong> announcements, which means we likely won't get any news at all regarding what Nintendo has coming. Instead, it'll be about what the rest of the industry is bringing to the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this Direct event does happen next week, it'll already be the <strong>third</strong> Nintendo Direct event of 2026, after the year began with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> that revealed a first proper look at <strong>Yoshi</strong> in the film, followed by a Direct event dedicated to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></strong>.</p>



<p>But if you're not looking forward to either the film or Tomodachi Life, then next week's rumoured Direct is likely the first one you might actually tune in for. We could get another look at Switch 2 exclusive titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong>, and upcoming Switch 2 ports like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong>. </p>



<p>This may even be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> announced for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and those are just some guesses at some of the bigger announcements we could see. There are also scores of potential indie game reveals that could happen at this rumoured event.</p>



<p>But Nintendo has to confirm it's actually happening before we can really start to speculate at what will be there. The last Partner Showcase Nintendo hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">was in <strong>July 2025</strong></a>, and it announced the event the day before it happened. If Nintendo sticks to that same strategy, then we should expect a reveal next <strong>Wednesday</strong>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Rumors Point To An Incoming Flood Of Switch 2 Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/february-nintendo-direct-switch-2-3d-mario-2000664537</link>
            <guid>1420885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The usual suspects are buzzing about an upcoming Nintendo Direct to kick off February. This one will reportedly be a Partner Showcase, so while I wouldn’t expect teases for anything wild like a new <em>3D Mario</em> game, we’ll probably got a healthy influx of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">Switch 2 ports</a> to help button down the first half of the platform’s year.</p> <p>Nintendo traditionally holds a February showcase to preview what’s coming and help fill in release calendar slots for its loyal fans. Podcasting insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016962284921249815">NateTheHate</a> and YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKp9okfMtdI">GameXplain</a> have both suggested 2026 will follow a similar pattern, though the event will be a Partner Showcase rather than a full-blown first-party Direct. <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a></em> was also able to corroborate those claims. So expect a new Nintendo Direct somewhere around February 3-5.</p>

 <p>But what is Nintendo likely to show? Well, we’re still waiting on firm release dates for <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2. The latter was recently rumored to be coming near the end of February. There’s also been plenty of smoke about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> making it over to Nintendo’s latest console, as well as the port for <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> coming sooner than expected. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> also seem like potential candidates.</p> <p>I’m more curious to see where this missing Microsoft support for the Switch 2 is. Some version of <em>Call of Duty</em> is rumored to be coming to the platform this spring and the company still hasn’t confirmed a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake port for the Switch 2. There’s also plenty of lower-hanging fruit like<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Avowed</em>, which is coming to PS5 next month. <em>Starfield</em> would also be a big get. Is a Switch 2 port part of the game’s rumored 2.0 plans? Hopefully.</p>

 <p>Announcements for new games would also be nice. We know we’re getting FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">multiplayer action game <em>Duskbloods</em></a> sometime this year. It’ll be interesting to see if any other major studios reveal exclusive side-projects for the Nintendo platform. But in the new era of every game being playable on every device, that seems less likely than a slew of new AAA ports.</p>

<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s director has put fans’ minds at ease, reaffirming that the game remains unaffected despite the recent restructuring. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed</a> last week that, despite being one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 had survived the recent organizational, operational, and portfolio reset. A spokesperson later confirmed that the game remained a priority for them within their strategy, centred on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-beyond-good-amp-evil-2-game-and-team-unaffected">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 Game and Team Unaffected</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421227406130335744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 creative director Fawzi Mesmar reaffirmed that he, the team, and the game “are unaffected by the recent changes.” Mesmar also spoke about the remaining cancellations and studio closures, encouraging people to support those affected in whatever way they can. Check out the complete statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure. </p>



<div><p>Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone – myself included – to offer support whenever and however they can during these times.</p><p>We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>For those who may not be aware, Ubisoft’s restructuring has resulted in the cancellation of the highly anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will prioritize open-world adventures and experiences designed for Games as a Service (GaaS), featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five creative divisions</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Is PUBG: Blindspot on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the PUBG universe is on the horizon with the release of PUBG: Blindspot into early access, though questions are naturally being asked about the available platforms.</p>



<p>The 5v5 top-down tactical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> is bringing an entirely new approach for PUBG fans, and there’s a strong audience to appeal to, given the vast success of PUBG over the years.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether PUBG: Blindspot is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-ps5">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Image via PUBG</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot will not be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on February 5, and there’s no end in sight for PS5 players.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access period is exclusive for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, but, potentially more significant is that there have been no details of a planned release on PS5.</p>



<p>The top-down shooter is an entirely different genre from the main PUBG title, and may not adapt well to PS5, which could explain its absence.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, similar to the situation with PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S players will not be able to play PUBG: Blindspot on the February 5 launch date.</strong></p>



<p>Again, the early access launch is for PC only, and there is no news on a potential Xbox Series X|S launch in the future, but it is still early days for the game.</p>



<p>More details about any plans for console releases could come deeper into PUBG: Blindspot’s lifespan, with the early access release merely marking the next step on a long journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot is not available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles at launch, though this isn’t surprising given the overall platform status.</strong></p>



<p>Given that PUBG: Blindspot isn’t on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that there is no Switch launch, and, of all the platforms the title could come to in the future, the Nintendo platform is likely at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>CM Punk is on the cover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>During the Royal Rumble coverage on ESPN 2, WWE CM Punk is the cover star of the standard edition of WWE 2K26. Pre-orders are now open, and the release is set for March 13 worldwide.</p>



<p>Currently, the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, is on the cover of a WWE video game for the first time since WWE ’13 back in 2012. Of course, Punk left the WWE for 10 years after a dispute with Vince McMahon and Triple H, which was spurred on by exhaustion and frustration with the direction of his career.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported </a>that Punk would be the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Not only will players be able to relive some of CM Punk’s classic career moments, but there will also be the opportunity to play through some dream matches that could have happened had CM Punk not left WWE in 2014.</p>

<p>All three higher-priced editions of WWE 2K26 will feature Triple H on the cover in some respect. The Monday Night War Edition is slated to provide the most content access. It is also expected to be the most expensive.
