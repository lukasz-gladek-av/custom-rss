			<p>The battle between KRAFTON and Subnautica 2 developers Unknown Worlds, has escalated even further, as the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds' co-founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill is now unsealed, revealing the full details regarding why the co-founders are suing KRAFTON for a breach of contract.</p>



<p>If you want to get a recap on what's happened so far, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">check out a bullet point list here</a> that goes through all the events in this saga so far. Today's story comes from the fact that the lawsuit the co-founders filed is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">now available to read in full</a>, if you're so inclined. </p>



<p>Some key context, if you've not been following this story, is that when Unknown Worlds was acquired by KRAFTON in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>, it did so for $500 million, with an additional $250 million to be paid out as a bonus to the studio if it hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. On paper, the three co-founders and 40 employees at Unknown Worlds were due to receive a portion of that bonus, with the co-founders receiving the bulk of it. The co-founders also stipulate that they would have spread the wealth even further to the other members of the team who were not due to receive the bonus on paper.</p>



<p>According to the co-founders, Unknown Worlds' relationship with KRAFTON only started to deteriorate when KRAFTON realized that Subnautica 2 launching in early access by the end of this year would have meant the studio hitting and surpassing the revenue targets required to unlock the $250 million bonus. </p>



<p>The suit even adds that KRAFTON's chief executive officer, Changhan Kim, admitted to the Unknown Worlds co-founders that if Subnautica 2 was released in early access in 2025, and Unknown Worlds hit its revenue targets to unlock the $250 million bonus, "<em>it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for KRAFTON</em>." The company now denies that Kim made such an admission, and blames it on translators misinterpreting Kim's words, despite that never being an issue previously.</p>



<p>"<em>So KRAFTON engaged in a months-long campaign to delay Subnautica 2's release,</em>" the suit reads. "<em>It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks. Multiple KRAFTON employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purposes of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement's prohibition on taking actions for that purpose</em>."</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds would not be swayed by these sabotage measures, and members of the studio took it upon themselves to do the things its publisher, KRAFTON, should have been doing. It's at this point where we catch up to the events that began on July 2, with the three co-founders being fired. </p>



<p>"<em>In flagrant disregard of the parties' contract, KRAFTON terminated without cause three former owners of Unknown Worlds - Charles Cleveland, Adam "Max" McGuire, and Edward "Ted" Gill (the "Founders") - and seized control of the company. KRAFTON's first decision upon taking over? To delay the launch of Subnautica 2 until sometime in 2026. That way, KRAFTON could keep the game's revenue for itself, while avoiding the $250 million earnout it would likely have owed the Founders and other Unknown Worlds employees.</em>"</p>



<p>The lawsuit also attacks claims made by KRAFTON, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">previously claimed</a> that Cleveland and the other co-founders had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds in order to work on a "<em>personal film project</em>." According to the suit, the co-founders were working on a film. A Subnautica movie, that KRAFTON had asked the co-founders to work on.</p>



<p>It further attacks claims made by KRAFTON that Subnautica 2 was not ready for early access launch. In the milestone review documents that were leaked and subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed to be real by KRAFTON</a>, the publisher claims that Subnautica 2 was lacking content, and that based on player feedback from internal playtests, it had to be delayed into 2026. </p>



<p>According to the co-founders' lawsuit, the 'experts' KRAFTON hired to deem Subnautica 2 as unfit weren't experts at all and had no experience developing and releasing early access titles. The co-founders also flat-out disagreed with the assessment of player feedback from the internal playtests, saying that the feedback in fact "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" that Subnautica 2 was ready to launch.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also alleges that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">statement made on the Unknown Worlds website</a> confirming the delay of Subnautica 2 was written by KRAFTON, after the publisher took control of the site and published without the knowledge of anyone at Unknown Worlds.</p>



<p>"<em>In short, KRAFTON flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without cause. Promise broken</em>...<em>In the name of its bottom line, KRAFTON has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON now has the task of trying to argue against these claims. We'll continue to update you on this story as more details become public and as KRAFTON tries to fire back.</p>

            <p>
The grey, uncomfortably moist British summer is finally here and Epic is celebrating the occasion - well, the season - with the launch of its Epic Store Summer Sale. But there's more, seeing as Thursday also marks a fresh batch of new freebies, which this week includes Civilisation 6.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those freebies, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">Civilisation 6 is available in its Platinum Edition</a>, meaning you get the base game, six DLC packs, and two expansions for your initial outlay of zero pence. That's good! Civilisation 6 is good (shut up haters)! So you should download it now.
</p>
<p>
Civ 6 will continue to be free until next Thursday, 24th July, after which Legion TD 2 - an "infinitely replayable multiplayer and single-player tower defense" game - takes its place.
</p>
<p>
So that's the free stuff out the way, which brings us to Epic's Summer Sale, which runs from today, 17th July, until 31st July. Working slightly backward, all purchases made during the sale (and using Epic's payment system) will earn you Epic Reward points as usual, but the percentage has been boosted to 20 percent. There's also a permanent 20 percent back for all purchases made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what of this sale? Epic's calling it "two weeks of discounts on best-selling games, from the biggest titles to some excellent indie games." And there's some good stuff here. There's 10 percent off developer Sandfall Interactive's highly acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/expedition-33-b3240d"></a>, for instance, plus 25 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, 50 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>, or 20 percent off if you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">opt for its sequel</a>. There's plenty more of course, and you'll find it all as you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US">peruse moistly around the Epic Games Store</a>.

			<p>While it wasn’t to everyone’s tastes, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> was a real breakthrough hit for developers Teyon. Having followed the dev team since the wonderfully awful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/13/rambo-the-video-game-review/">Rambo</a> game, and rather enjoying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/21/terminator-resistance-review/">Terminator: Resistance</a>, it’s great to see their progress being rewarded. While I enjoyed Rogue City a lot <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">more than my erstwhile colleague</a>, there were clear issues with pacing in that title as the beat cop aspects felt a little over represented. Unfinished Business feels like a direct response to that criticism as it is a far more focused and better paced adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsZxnR-EM6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The retro stylings of RoboCop are clear to see, the shiny graphics engine notwithstanding. Old school tech, clunky electronics, green screen monitors and VCRs litter the environment. This retro feel is further compounded by Unfinished Business being a good old-fashioned standalone expansion rather than a DLC. This means that not only is it a complete narrative in its own right, but that you don’t need to own or even have played the original. It does follows on from the first game – which was itself set between RoboCop 2 and 3 – but also adds new origin lore so that, aside from some dialogue references, you wouldn’t miss out on anything by playing this first.</p>


<p>I played through Unfinished Business on PS5, having enjoyed the original on PC and although I always prefer mouse and keyboard for first-person titles, the tank-like nature of RoboCop means that it handles equally as well on controller. Teyon have really captured the feel of being a massive chunk of metal with the absence of any jump or crouch distinguishing gameplay from other FPS games. There are sections where you control other characters in Unfinished Business, such as with flashbacks to a pre-robo Alex Murphy, giving the opportunity to have traditional controls that contrast brilliantly with our main unstoppable cyborg hero.</p>


<p>The opening level of Unfinished Business is a traumatic one. The Precinct has been attacked and you investigate the carnage to discover that your OCP interface equipment has been stolen. Once you track the mercenaries responsible to the Omnitower – an OCP skyscraper that sits outside the jurisdiction of the police force – you set out to seek justice (and a bit of light revenge). The focused nature of the location here helps to avoid the somewhat frustrating meandering of the first game. There are still side quests and investigations to carry out, but they feel much more rooted to the central narrative than they did in Rogue City.</p>
<p>Once you find your way into the OmniTower, you are soon greeted over your communications by a mysterious ally who offers guidance and can hack some locked doors for you – their identity is key to the surprisingly effective story that adds a lot to the general lore of RoboCop. This is also expanded by the reveal of the main villain, a face from Murphy’s past with a twisted motivation of their own. Voice acting is solid throughout, and while some of the facial animations are a little uncanny valley this wasn’t enough to distract from the delivery.</p>

<p>The real meat of the game comes from the visceral combat and RoboCop has a wealth of weapons to wield. The default Auto-9 pistol returns and can be upgraded using different circuit boards as you progress. Some of the best boards are rewards for completing side quests and the parts you use to upgrade are hidden in OCP chests scattered throughout the tower. I found a high-powered board that gave me automatic fire and no need to reload, fulfilling the RoboCop power fantasy to a tee, even if it did make some of the later encounters a little too easy.</p>
<p>Alongside your trusty pistol there are many different weapons to pick up and use, and you can carry one extra alongside the Auto-9. These range from a simple pistol to assault rifles, a gatling gun and even some high-tech story related weapons so there’s never a shortage of firearms to mix up the combat. You can also pick up and throw environmental objects, as well as trigger special environmental takedowns when near particular parts of the scenery.</p>

<p>The focused nature of the location is accompanied by a plot that drives you through the game’s 8-10 hour play time. As mentioned above, the side quests are far more integrated into the main story and there isn’t the same kind of tedious downtime that plagued the first game (although I quite enjoyed the banal side of ticketing wrongly parked cars). Most of the characters you interact with have some function to aid your progression and there are some suitably funny interactions at times.</p>
<p>A minor complaint is that I did have a couple of small progress bugs where actions didn’t trigger in my review build, but these were very rare and always sorted themselves out after a quick reload.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Unfinished Business is a great evolution of Teyon’s take on RoboCop, with the more focused narrative and progression helping the story to push you through some combat encounters, whilst also adding some excellent lore to the wider world of Alex Murphy. If you enjoyed the first game, and maybe even if you didn’t, then I can recommend this return to Detroit. You have more than ten seconds to comply, but resistance is futile.	</p></div>

<p>"This ain't no f@#%ing kid's game"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Woah, woah, woah! Steady on, chaps. It seems as though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/edge_of_allegoria">The Edge of Allegoria</a>, a turn-based RPG that harkens back to the graphical style and gameplay of Game Boy gems of yore, might not be the kid-friendly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> tribute it seems at first glance.</p>
<p>Arriving on 7th August on Switch 1, Button Factory Games' ode to the old-school RPGs on Nintendo's classic handheld strikes an adults-only tone in an effort to stand out and, judging by the trailer, it certainly looks like you might need to cover any nearby children's eyes and/or ears, unless you want them to hear mild drug references, swear words, and mentions of various horse parts. Oh my goodness!</p>
<p>There have already been some reviews of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1870700/The_Edge_of_Allegoria/">the Steam version</a> of this one, where it's been available since December last year, and honestly it sounds like foul-mouthed Pokémon with some reasonably decent battling to us. A win-win scenario.</p>
<p>Whether or not the crude humour is gonna work may be more a matter of personal taste/a sticking point, though, so make sure to scope out the trailer at the top of this very article. It's sat on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1870700/The_Edge_of_Allegoria/">a "Very Positive" user rating</a> (from 139 reviews) over on Valve's platform, so it may well be worth making a little note of, especially if sweary characters and sexy pixel butts are your cup of tea.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some press release deets and a few screens!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Harvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably expected to carry on their person at any given time.</p>
<p>There are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid you on your journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Edge of Allegoria launches on Nintendo Switch on 7th August and is priced at <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-edge-of-allegoria-switch/">$24.99 over on the US eShop.</a></p>

For a long time, it seemed like the project might be dead in the water given how little news there was about it. But now it looks like the streamer is ready to lock in and get down to business.</p><p>Netflix announced today that it has officially greenlit a new <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series that will be showrun and executive produced by Roberto Patino (<em>Westworld</em>, <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>) and David Wiener (<em>Halo</em>, <em>Brave New World</em>.) Along with Wiener and Patino, Ubisoft’s Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill, and Matt O’Toole are attached to executive produce.</p><p>Per Netflix, the new series will focus on “the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” The show will tell stories about multiple characters living through and influencing pivotal moments in human history. That doesn’t exactly say much about what the series will look and feel like, but it does sound like pretty standard <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fare.</p><p>In a statement about the show, Wiener and Patino said that they’re both excited about and humbled by all the possibilities the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>IP holds. They also expressed their desire to use the series to tell a story about what humanity loses as a species as our emotional connections break.</p><p>“Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story — about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith,” the duo said. “It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time.”</p><p>Netflix has had a fair amount of success with its animated video game adaptations like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24345341/castlevania-noctune-season-2-review-netflix"><em>Castlevania </em>series</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix"><em>Arcane</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/8/23159839/cyberpunk-edgerunners-anime-netflix-trailer-release-date"><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em></a>. But the streamer has had a much more inconsistent track record on the live-action side of things between its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134057/netflix-the-witcher-season-5-end">soon-to-be finished <em>Witcher </em>series</a> and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23186343/netflix-resident-evil-series-review">short-lived <em>Resident Evil </em>riff</a>. A five year gap between a project being announced and its subsequent greenlight isn’t <em>necessarily </em>a bad thing, and Wiener and Patino could absolutely be cooking up something fantastic. But we’re going to need to see and hear a bit more about what this <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>is going to be before people can get excited.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/netflix/708989/netflix-assassins-creed-roberto-patino]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-labyrinth-review-in-progress.1246371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller"><u>Secret Level</u></a>, that Amazon Prime mini-series of short films inspired by popular video games? You know the episode that recast Pac-Man as a marooned warrior abducting strangers to help it fight its way out of a prison planet? Well, Bandai Namco fleshed that idea out into a lengthy metroidvania called Shadow Labyrinth – a rare Street Fighter: The Movie-type beat – and this bizarre reimagining of the industry’s oldest eater has been a truly challenging experience for me so far. Not necessarily because it’s difficult, as it’s not a cake walk but I’ve thrown myself against the rocks of more tortuous games in the past. No, my biggest struggle after 10 hours with it has been with staying interested in Shadow Labyrinth’s cryptic, slow, and frankly boring story while also fighting through some brutal checkpointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not completely against the idea of a gritty reboot of Pac-Man in theory, but the execution here has not made a great case for it in practice at this point. The story, which drapes you in the rags of Puck’s (read: Pac-Man’s) sword swinging goon, sort of exists around you. It makes some sense given you’ve woken up without any memories or understanding of the wreckage of war that you’re being lead through by your scheming yellow companion, but Shadow Labyrinth’s insistence on making you stand around and watch broken, vague, trope-bloated dialogue between the handful of active characters is arduous. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10-minute Secret Level episode does a much more effective job of weaving an interesting parable by using the “cycle of survival” story as a parallel of the cyclical nature of Pac-Man’s eat-die-repeat gameplay. As a direct sequel to that short, Shadow Labyrinth expands on the story exponentially, but seems to fill that new space with dense, rote sci-fi lore that has so far had very few compelling plot happenings sprinkled throughout. I will hedge all of this by saying that, at the time right before writing this, the journey of Puck and the Swordsman took a pretty major turn that <em>could </em>unlock a lot more potential for a real compelling tale to be told – but based on what I’ve seen up to this point, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow Labyrinth looks pretty good, though. The sort of moving paper doll animation used so well in games like Salt and Sanctuary is mostly solid here, too. There’s a surprising level of detail in many of the monsters I’ve encountered, especially the mechanical ones with all of their bits and doodads. Animations can feel a little stilted and floaty, like a marionette on strings, but it doesn’t affect the action in any meaningful way. The levels themselves make good use of color in their fore and backgrounds, but I wouldn’t call its renditions of the depths of a lava filled cavern or the many stories of a high tech tower all that unique. I haven’t found a zone that really has that kind of evocative wow factor, yet.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It expands on its Prime Video prequel episode with dense sci-fi lore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual task of moving through these expansive areas has become progressively more engaging. Platforming has yet to be much of a challenge, with some side paths occasionally leading to more dangerous mini-puzzles and obstacles that’ll test your timing and reflexes. I was regularly presented with rails that morph you into the round yellow chomp machine we all recognize. These tracks allow you to waka waka waka up designated walls, around corners, and across ceilings, munching on pellets (which is a currency to spend on perks and upgrades) as you go. Hopping from line to line or launching Puck at foes with a spinning sword attack is funny at first, but I haven’t really encountered a section of this that feels truly clever outside of the fact that the gimmick exists in the first place. These are such isolated experiences at this point that if you removed all of these sections from Shadow Labyrinth, I wouldn’t miss any of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While on foot, obscure signposting and an abundance of crossroads often makes it unclear where the critical path lies and has had me regularly stumbling into side paths by accident, which sometimes leads to goodies like bonus health, and other times leads to a roadblock that I don’t yet have the upgrade to surmount. Sauntering around these corners has also felt oppressively dangerous as death will jettison me back to a checkpoint that almost always feels miles away from where I fell. It’s made more stressful because the checkpointing system is actually two-tiered: there are larger Miku Sol points that you can upgrade your warrior with and teleport between, and smaller pylons that are checkpoints in the strictest, old school sense of the word. As resources dwindle and the paths to explore splinter and multiply seemingly endlessly, a little misstep here or there could erase so much of my progress that I can feel just as trapped in these places as Puck does. Maybe that's the point, they don’t like it and neither do I.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, combat is full of your standard fare for a game like this. You can dodge around and swing a sword in a basic combo from the start. You unlock a power attack that is used alone for large ranged damage or linked to the end of your basic combo as a satisfying finisher. There’s an air dash, a grappling hook, a parry, etc. all waiting to be found and added to your repertoire as well, each of which cost a little bit of your ESP gauge to use. Running that meter to empty puts you in a Street Fighter 6-style burnout condition, meaning you can’t do anything but attack until it recharges again. This is a heavy penalty, but a meaningful one and requires you to really pay attention to how much offense you’re attempting to unload at once. Perks can alter you in smaller ways, like making your dodge cost less ESP or showing the remaining health of the last enemy you hit, but I haven't found enough of them to determine if their effect on combat is significant. At about 10 hours in, all of these elements have not yet combined to create a stylish flow or skill checking scenarios to  spice up the act of turning enemies into dust beyond much more than rote button mashing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puck can get in on the action on occasion, combining with your swordsman to become a sort of mechanical dragon creature that rips and tears until its timed energy bar is done. It’s fun to be big enough to ignore enemy damage and adverse terrain for a short period of time, but you are still largely just mashing the basic attack button until you can’t anymore. To recharge this mode, you have to devour fallen foes, which also give you various crafting materials that I have quite literally never looked at outside of the one time it was prudent to - the only time I’ve seen the vendor that deals with them was in passing early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve run into quite a variety of different types of enemies to use all of this offense on, but you spend so much time in large zones that baddies turn from new challenges to nuisances pretty quickly. Enemies that you can’t simply whack to death at first sight are few and far between, and they’re rarely arranged in a way that makes them a real threat to progress, the occasional archer standing on a platform you need to jump up to hit notwithstanding. Bosses as of right now haven’t required much strategy outside of basic pattern recognition, either. A giant rooster mini-boss gave me an opportunity to use my air dash optimally just after unlocking it, but no other boss has nudged that kind of extra technical layer out of my combat strategy, yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am certainly a bit down on my time with Shadow Labyrinth so far. I’m leaving my expectations open for the possibility that its just a slow starter, even if 10 hours is a long runway to give a game like this in hopes it will take flight (we are told a playthrough could take 30+). I like but do not love its combat, which sticks to the melee-heavy metroidvania formula dutifully. I’m hopeful that the levels themselves evolve both in how they look and how they challenge my platforming and swordswinging skills, as they are showing small signs of ramping up the intensity. I'm not as optimistic for more compelling storytelling from the characters and spaces I'm presently in, as my brain has been wandering this seemingly endless maze of lore chasing the ghosts of the intense, affecting promise that the Secret Level short this is based on is teased.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green and the Multitude of Metroidvainias</h3><p>A mighty list of very good metroidvainias</p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-review]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo has seemingly been switching many of the voice actors behind the company's collection of characters over the past few years. For instance, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toad-actor-says-nintendo-has-replaced-her-after-18-years/1100-6532176/">Princess Peach and Toad voice actor Samantha Kelly says she was replaced after 18 years</a> with Mario Kart World. In 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-will-no-longer-be-voiced-by-longtime-actor-charles-martinet/1100-6517020/">Charles Martinet stepped back from voicing Mario</a> after being behind the character since Super Mario 64 in 1996. Last month, Martinet explained that he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charles-martinet-wont-say-anything-weird-as-mario-to-preserve-characters-integrity/1100-6532374/">won't say anything weird as Mario for fans to preserve the character's "integrity." </a></p><p dir="ltr">As for Takeda, the actor actually has contributed to a couple of other big-name Nintendo games, too. Takeda voiced Master Mummy in Arms and Daruk in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donkey Kong Bananza launched today on Nintendo Switch 2. The game exists because Nintendo executive Yoshiaka Koizumi asked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-super-mario-odyssey-to-bananza-nintendo-acclaimed-team-takes-on-donkey-kong/1100-6532873/">the Super Mario Odyssey team</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-is-happening-because-nintendo-exec-wanted-a-3d-kong-game/1100-6533099/">look into a 3D Donkey Kong project</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming-as-dev-signs-new-partnership.1246311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>developer Dragami Games has announced it's signed an agreement with Taiwanese "IP investment and development" company Nada Holdings to develop new projects based on the aforementioned hack-and-slash property.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/nada-holdings-and-dragami-games-launch-new-ip-development-for-lollipop-chainsaw/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Nada Holdings website, the company says "multiple new projects" based on&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>&nbsp;will be launched as a collaboration between Nada and Dragami, although the company stops short of saying exactly what those projects will be.</p>

<p>Nada does, however, say that "cumulative sales" of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>have reached 1.5 million. That figure presumably includes both the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">last year's remaster</a>, since the company makes reference to "13 years of continued fan support".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=tjF6mMgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=uSgYR-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nada, the new collaboration between itself and Dragami aims to expand <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>through "multifaceted projects and cross-industry collaborations", so presumably, it's not just new games the two are working on.</p>

<p>Dragami CEO Shohei Sato says the new projects will "carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise", while Nada Holdings chairman Joe Teng says his company will "devote itself wholeheartedly to preserving the spirit of the original work and meeting the expectations of its fans".</p>

<p>Teng also says the collaboration will result in a "wide range of new projects", which, again, indicates that we're not just in for a&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>sequel. I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of anime series or streaming show in the works, as well as a spinoff or two.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game that was originally released way back in the mists of 2012 for seventh-gen machines. The original game was the result of a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>'s Suda51 and James Gunn, who's currently helming the latest&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>In 2022, a remake of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, but following requests from fans, the remake was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">scaled back to a remaster</a>, likely to stick to the developers' intentions of making the new version "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</i>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9ntpb0c2028v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;(as well as Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

But even as more powerful Windows handhelds arrived to keep up with more demanding games, none have beaten the Steam Deck’s combination of ease-of-use, ergonomics, power, and battery life at an affordable price.</p><p>That still hasn’t changed. The Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS is not the Steam Deck killer that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/handheld-gaming/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-review">some headlines</a> <a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">would</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/lenovos-legion-go-s-with-steamos-is-the-only-real-alternative-to-a-steam-deck-2000621525">have</a> you believe.</p><div><p>This was supposed to be <em>a moment</em> for handhelds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">When the Legion Go S was revealed as the first authorized third-party handheld to run SteamOS</a>, with a $499 starting price, it looked like a true Steam Deck competitor was finally on the way. It even had the blessing and support of the Steam Deck’s creators — something we’d never seen before.</p></div><p>With an actual price of $599 and tradeoffs galore, the base Legion Go S with SteamOS is not a match for the $550 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>. The more powerful AMD Z1 Extreme model is not half bad, but it’s far more expensive at $829.</p><p>But within the disappointment, there is some good news: it’s better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">the $730 Windows version with the same hardware</a> that came out last February, and SteamOS is definitely a better experience than Windows.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Z2 Go performance only on par with Steam Deck</li><li>Battery life falls behind Steam Deck</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->830</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>SteamOS is a huge improvement over Windows</li><li>Good ergonomics</li><li>Good performance</li><li>Great, variable refresh rate screen</li><li>Powerful cooling</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Battery falls behind top Windows handhelds</li><li>Somewhat slippery texture</li><li>Nearly useless touchpad</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">I couldn’t believe just how poor the Windows gaming experience was</a> on this handheld’s AMD Z2 Go chip. A $550 Steam Deck ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> faster <em>on battery</em> than a $730 Lenovo did while plugged in at maximum boost! And as usual, Windows was a pig: the less you know about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=I%20spent%20nearly%2045%20minutes">the Windows out-of-box experience</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#:~:text=it%20does%20not%20reliably%20go%20to%20sleep%20and%20wake%20up%20again">wake / sleep issues</a>, the better.</p></div><p>Thankfully, SteamOS washes away the Windows stains. Imagine <em>just pressing a power button</em> to pause a game, then seamlessly resuming the next time you press it! Imagine simply picking a language and scanning a Steam Guard QR code to log into your handheld for the first time, instead of spending 45 minutes batting away upsells for Microsoft 365 Copilot and kin.</p><p>And even though the Windows version has also (slightly) improved since I first tested it, the Legion Go S is<em> so much faster</em> with SteamOS: roughly 17 percent faster, in my tests.</p><div><h2>Windows vs. SteamOS with the Legion Go S</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (spring ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go Windows (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go SteamOS (summer ‘25)</h3></th><th><h3>Windows improvement since spring</h3></th><th><h3>SteamOS improvement over Windows</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>44</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>4.55%</td><td>30.43%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>55</td><td>69</td><td>0.00%</td><td>25.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>0.00%</td><td>21.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>64</td><td>76</td><td>3.23%</td><td>18.75%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>68</td><td>77</td><td>4.62%</td><td>13.24%</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>39</td><td>50</td><td>8.33%</td><td>28.21%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td>46</td><td>59</td><td>12.20%</td><td>28.26%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>45</td><td>50</td><td>63</td><td>11.11%</td><td>26.00%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>46</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>13.04%</td><td>26.92%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>49</td><td>56</td><td>62</td><td>14.29%</td><td>10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>58</td><td>67</td><td>3.57%</td><td>15.52%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>6.35%</td><td>10.45%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>71</td><td>77</td><td>7.58%</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>72</td><td>78</td><td>7.46%</td><td>8.33%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>70</td><td>73</td><td>79</td><td>4.29%</td><td>8.22%</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>21</td><td>4.17%</td><td>-16.00%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>15.38%</td><td>-20.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>26</td><td>6.90%</td><td>-16.13%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>33</td><td>27</td><td>10.00%</td><td>-18.18%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>32</td><td>35</td><td>27</td><td>9.38%</td><td>-22.86%</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>48</td><td>54</td><td>-9.43%</td><td>12.50%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>56</td><td>59</td><td>5.66%</td><td>5.36%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>61</td><td>9.09%</td><td>1.67%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>64</td><td>62</td><td>62</td><td>-3.13%</td><td>0.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>65</td><td>65</td><td>71</td><td>0.00%</td><td>9.23%</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>30</td><td>0.00%</td><td>66.67%</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>20</td><td>32</td><td>-4.76%</td><td>60.00%</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>33</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>57.14%</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>21</td><td>34</td><td>-12.50%</td><td>61.90%</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>39</td><td>4.17%</td><td>56.00%</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All values are average framerates at 720p and low settings, save Cyberpunk at “Steam Deck” setting.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>SteamOS’s performance increase can translate to better battery life, too. On the Windows model, playing 2020’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla </em>at 720p resolution and 60fps at low settings required an average of 36 watts — enough to drain the Legion Go S’s 55 watt-hour battery in 1.5 hours. But with SteamOS, the same 60fps gameplay requires just 22 watts, giving you an entire extra hour of gameplay (55 watt-hours divided by 22 watts = 2.5 hours) <em>just by installing a different OS. </em></p><p>Not all games see as dramatic a boost, but the same is true of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>: if you play at 50fps, you get up to an extra hour of battery life from SteamOS.</p><p>SteamOS also makes it so much easier to change those power modes, map out new control schemes, and monitor your performance and battery life. You can simply hold down a button and flick a joystick to change your screen brightness or summon a virtual mouse, so there’s no need to dive into menus. You can even install <a href="https://decky.xyz/">Decky</a>, the unofficial SteamOS plugin loader, on a Legion Go S, to flesh out your Steam Library with game art or more easily install Epic Game Store titles.</p><p>But all that is also true of the Steam Deck, which costs less, excels at games that don’t require the horsepower of <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, and makes it easier to play decades of PC titles that <em>weren’t</em> built for gamepad controls.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck OLED next to the Legion Go S. Tap through my gallery for more hardware images.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The Steam Deck has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955238/valve-steam-controller-trackpad-deck-pc-gaming-controller-mouse-button">two large, responsive touchpads</a> that can emulate a trackball, pull up a radial menu, or each act as an extra set of four buttons to map your keyboard commands. The Legion Go S has a single ultra-tiny touchpad that puts up such a fight whenever I try to use it that I’ve already given up. The Steam Deck has four back buttons, enough so you can bind ABXY and never have to take your thumb off the right analog stick; the Legion Go S only has two.</p><p>More importantly to me: perhaps because of these differences in controls, the Legion Go S is missing the mountain of community controller layouts that Steam Deck, PlayStation, and Xbox controller users have been creating for years. Those layouts, which map the games’ commands to the controllers’ buttons and joysticks, make it a cinch to play mouse-and-keyboard games on a handheld without the tedious work of figuring out a control scheme from scratch. On a Steam Deck, or on any PC with a common controller plugged in, those layout options show up automatically if you go looking. With the Legion Go S, the repository of custom controller profiles is totally empty. The Legion Go S’s layout is nearly identical to Xbox, so why doesn’t it pull up Xbox controller profiles at least? This honestly feels like an oversight, and I hope it’ll be fixed.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Community Layouts section is just… empty.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As I explained in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad">my review of the Windows Legion Go S</a>, though, this hardware does feel great. It’s solid, reassuringly well-built, with my second-favorite screen on a handheld after the Steam Deck OLED. While it doesn’t have the true HDR or deep blacks of Valve’s OLED, the 8-inch IPS touchscreen makes the Steam Deck’s 7.4-inch screen seem cramped by comparison, to say nothing of the 7-inch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">ROG Ally X</a>. And like the Ally, Lenovo’s 120Hz variable refresh rate can make for smoother gameplay, particularly on the model with AMD’s Z1 Extreme chip.</p><p>The Steam Deck’s one notable disadvantage is that its performance has only slightly improved in three and a half years as games continue to get more demanding. Big hits like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> have pushed it out of its comfort zone, and where rivals like the Legion Go S can unlock better performance when plugged into the wall or draining their batteries at very high rates, the Steam Deck can’t.</p><p>The Legion Go S officially brings those “turbo” modes to SteamOS, as well. But if that’s why you’re buying, don’t get the $599 Z2 Go model.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Z2 Go FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z1 Extreme FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Deck OLED FPS</h3></th><th><h3>Z2G battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Z1E battery drain</h3></th><th><h3>Deck battery drain</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>50</td><td>57</td><td>50</td><td>22W (~2.5h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>73</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>79</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>82</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>44.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>74</td><td>61</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>22W (~2.2h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>74</td><td>92</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>77</td><td>99</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>100</td><td>N/A</td><td>41.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>22.5W (~2.4h)</td><td>25.5W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td><td>30W (~1.8h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>38.5W (~1.4h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>45.5W (~1.2h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>54</td><td>62</td><td>57</td><td>23W (~2.4h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23.5W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>31.5W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>61</td><td>89</td><td>N/A</td><td>36W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>62</td><td>93</td><td>N/A</td><td>42.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>43.5W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>30</td><td>37</td><td>33</td><td>23.5W (~2.3h)</td><td>25W (~2.2h)</td><td>23W (~2.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>32</td><td>47</td><td>N/A</td><td>29W (~1.9h)</td><td>32W (~1.7h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>50</td><td>N/A</td><td>35.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>37.5W (~1.5h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td>34</td><td>52</td><td>N/A</td><td>43W (~1.3h)</td><td>44W (~1.3h)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, 3 to 5-watt TDP, 60fps cap</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>8.1W (~6.8h)</td><td>8.2W (~6.7h)</td><td>6.9W (~7.1h)</td></tr><tr><td>Balatro, lowest playable wattage and brightness, 30-40fps</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>30-40</td><td>7.6W (~7.2w)</td><td>8.0 (~6.9h)</td><td>5.2W (~9.4h)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not that the Z2 Go is slower than the Steam Deck overall. At max boost on wall power, the base Legion Go S can offer <em>up to</em> 35 percent better framerates. But the Z1 Extreme model offered up to 72 percent faster framerates than the Steam Deck and was 29 percent faster on average than the Z2 Go model. That’s enough to make a game feel smooth that was barely playable — like <em>Expedition 33</em> at the lowest settings — or comfortably go up an entire graphics preset in most games when you’re plugged into the wall.</p><p>(If you do plan to plug the Legion Go S into the wall, you may want to turn on fast charging in the BIOS — hold down Power + Volume Up when booting, then change Charging Speed Selection — and get yourself a 100W power adapter, because Lenovo’s stock 65W adapter isn’t enough to keep the battery from draining while you’re playing full bore.)</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I’ve been playing a lot of Expedition 33 on handhelds. Anecdotally, the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus runs it best and with the longest battery life; the Legion Go S Z1 Extreme is good for shorter sessions</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>The Steam Deck OLED can’t do turbo at all, but its custom chip can hold its own against the Z2 Go in unplugged “balanced” power modes. When I capped both at the same 15 watt power draw, the Steam Deck won in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em> and tied in <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, even as it lost in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon Zero Dawn, </em>and <em>Returnal</em>.</p><p>Another surprise in the Steam Deck’s favor: I played a <em>lot</em> of fiendish mansion-building mystery <em>Blue Prince </em>while testing the Legion Go S, and it’s far choppier on Lenovo’s handhelds. I don’t know if it’s had Steam Deck-specific optimizations, but I found I needed turbo mode on the Z1 Extreme for it to run as smoothly as it does on the Steam Deck.</p><p>If you do find yourself choosing between the two Lenovo Legion Go models, you won’t sacrifice much battery life by picking the beefier chip. In my tests, the Z1 Extreme model only drew 1 to 3 watts more than the Z2 Go on battery power — we’re talking about five minutes shorter battery life in the most intensive games and 15 minutes in less intensive ones.</p><p>But in those less intensive games like <em>Dirt Rally</em> or <em>Balatro</em>, the Steam Deck OLED is still the champ. Despite having a smaller 49Wh battery, it lasted over 50 minutes longer than either Legion Go S in my <em>Dirt Rally</em> battery drain test (where I set each handheld’s screen to the same brightness using a calibration tool) and managed two extra hours of magic poker game <em>Balatro </em>with battery-saving tweaks: 9 hours for Steam Deck vs. 7 hours for the Legion Go S.</p><p>I have to hand it to Lenovo and Valve: after tangling with the Windows model, I thought the entire Legion Go S lineup was going to be dead on arrival. But that’s not the case. Even the Z2 Go runs faster and more efficiently than it did on Windows, and the Z1 Extreme version is a legitimately good handheld if you get it with SteamOS. (You can technically install SteamOS on the Windows-based Legion Go S, but Valve tells me that’s not officially supported, and I ran into several issues when I tried it in early June.)</p><p>Valve and Lenovo have also moved swiftly to address some of the bugs the SteamOS version launched with. In the month and change since release, it’s fixed wonkiness around the power modes and the variable refresh rate screen, and how both the tiny touchpad and joystick LEDs can sometimes stop working when the handheld goes to sleep. (We’re still waiting on a way to control those RGB joystick LEDs in SteamOS, though.)</p><p>But while you might be happy with the $829 Z1 Extreme model around your home or otherwise close to an outlet, it’s not the best handheld you can buy. The Steam Deck OLED has it beat on price vs. performance and battery life for less intensive games, plus those community controller profiles and twin trackpads. It’s the pick if you don’t need beefy turbo modes or a big screen.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Legion Go S</em> <em>flanked by the MSI Claw 8 (top) and Asus ROG Ally X (bottom), both of which have far larger 80Wh batteries.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You might also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">try installing Bazzite on an Asus ROG Ally X</a>: I find it slightly less comfortable to hold, but with the same Z1 Extreme chip and a far larger 80Wh battery, it’s a better option than the Legion Go S for intensive games away from a plug.</p><p>Truthfully, though, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/editorial/688415/state-of-handheld-gaming-editorial-switch-2-deck-oled-sold-out">I wouldn’t buy <em>any</em> PC handheld</a> at this particular moment.

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">the <em>New York Times</em> acquired <em>Wordle</em></a> and went all-in on games, there’s been something of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">a slow-brewing arms race in the space</a>. The <em>Times</em> continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips">release new games</a>, and it’s now up against intriguing competitors like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687721/the-atlantic-games-hub-bracket-city"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a>, while established games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle"><em>Words With Friends</em></a> have adjusted their offerings in response. Also in that mix is Apple News Plus, which just launched a game that’s a bit like <em>Wordle</em> crossed with emoji.</p></div><p>It’s called simply <em>Emoji Game</em>, and each day you’re presented with three phrases, which have some letters filled in, but are mostly blank. There’s a partial hint as to what the word or phrase is that you’re trying to complete, and then a whole bunch of emoji at the bottom. The idea is to take the words or sounds the emoji represent and use them to fill in the blanks. So — and this is just an example I made up, so it’s not a spoiler — you might be presented with SH_ _ _, and an emoji of an elf. Stick it in there and you have a “shelf.”</p><p>It’s a novel twist on word games, which have become ubiquitous online over the last three years. It’s really forced me to use my brain in a different way, though I’m not sure if I enjoy it just yet. Maybe once it becomes a routine. That said, it’s nice that there doesn’t appear to be a fail state; when you guess wrong there’s no real punishment, though the game does count the number of moves it takes you to complete each puzzle, so there is a competitive element. The most recent few puzzles are also free to play, so you can get a feel for it even if you don’t currently have an Apple News Plus subscription. (It’s currently available only in the US and Canada.)</p><p>The <em>Emoji Game</em> is a small daily diversion, and one that points to the fascinating innovation and experimentation happening in the word game space. After <em>Wordle</em> and the subsequent rush of clones, there hasn’t really been a word game that has gone viral in the same way, and so designers are crafting interesting new twists on the formula to stand out. The idea is that you don’t necessarily need one blockbuster hit, but instead a varied collection that will keep folks coming back daily. Puzzmo, for instance, has steadily grown since it launched, with everything from an accessible crossword to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283527/puzzmo-weather-memoku">a weather-based take on sudoku</a>. It just launched an experimental word game called <em>Missing Link</em> that’s like an elevated take on word search puzzles.</p><p>As subscriptions continue to become an established part of modern life — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss">no shade</a> — these sorts of daily games have proven to be a successful retention tactic. Habits are hard to break, and that’s especially true when they provide a brief, welcome respite in the form of clever word play. Or emoji.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708935/apple-news-plus-emoji-game-wordle]]></content:encoded>

                <p>“Come on now, if we all pull together, we can lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders.”</p><p dir="ltr">This is a line from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1N6aaKWiw&amp;pp=ygUZZnJhbmsgdHVybmVyIGdsb3Jpb3VzIHlvddIHCQnNCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the song "Glorious You"</a> by one of my favorite musical artists, Frank Turner, and it’s a lyric that constantly comes to mind as I play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.</a></p><p dir="ltr">For those who haven’t played either of the games, you are, regardless, likely already familiar with the series' core concept: You play as a porter who delivers packages between outposts in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Ahead of the first entry's launch in 2019, game director Hideo Kojima stated that Death Stranding was to kickstart a new “Strand” genre. “By incorporating the concept of connection(strand), it's [a] totally brand-new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system),” tweeted Kojima earlier that summer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">As I'm getting similar questions so I shall re-post. DS is not a stealth game. Could move subjectively but not a FPS shooting game either. By incorporating with the concept of connection(strand), it's totally brand new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system). <a href="https://t.co/1KaQUVH9zL" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/1KaQUVH9zL</a></p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2019</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">What that nonsense translates to in terms of gameplay is actually something quite unique. In order to help quickly and safely deliver all of your packages, you can fabricate a variety of tools and infrastructure: something as simple as a climbing anchor to swiftly rappel down the side of a cliff face, or something as extravagant as a long stretch of road between two outposts.</p><p dir="ltr">As you advance through the world and story, your constructs begin to seep into other players' experiences, aiding them as they progress through their own games. At the same time, the structures others build transform your world, too. You might approach a perilous edge and a climbing anchor is already there, having been placed by another player in their own game world. You could bring a slew of resources to a road-constructing terminal, only to find that you don’t need as many supplies as you thought you did because other players have already contributed a nice chunk of the required materials.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only does this save you a ton of time and help you get a leg up on your deliveries, but it incentivizes you into also paying into the system, knowing that when, for example, you place a zipline to rapidly descend down a mountain, that very same zipline will likely appear in another player’s game, ready for them to use.</p><p>The first game already expanded the tools and infrastructure on offer with the release of its Director’s Cut, which meant, of course, that Death Stranding 2 needed to develop those systems even further. However, this has resulted in numerous players feeling that the sequel is lacking a lot of the “friction” that made Death Stranding what it is. Some feel that, whereas the first game had a nice balance of systems in place to help you along the way, Death Stranding 2 literally paves over its cracks with too many apparatuses that overtly streamline the process of making deliveries.</p><p dir="ltr">I don’t disagree with this analysis. In Death Stranding, I absolutely was transporting--more often than not by foot--far fewer packages and materials, and had fewer options for helpful tools and infrastructure. In On The Beach, I’ve pretty much just driven around in my truck that not only can store a lot more stuff than my backpack can carry, but also protects said stuff from the environmental hazards and Timefall, the name for rain and snow in the game that rapidly degrades whatever it touches. And yes, that truck is battery powered, leading to <em>some </em>tension if I’m unable to locate a charging station while out and about. But fortunately, I’m usually never too far from a charging pole someone else has constructed.</p><p dir="ltr">The game tries to add some friction back into the experience with heightened dangers. You are more frequently asked to face off against enemies who now also have more tools and infrastructure of their own to confront you with, and the environment itself has become deadlier, with natural disasters like flooding and landslides. However, it still feels as if the additions to and changes from the first game greatly favor the player in the second.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the saying goes: more money, more problems. Just substitute chiral chrystals for dollar bills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732"></a><figcaption>The road more travelled.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the original Death Stranding, every task seemed monumental, especially as the game progressed and deliveries started to require you to transport a package within a limited time frame or without crossing over a certain damage threshold. The “strand” aspect of the game, in which you help other players and in turn they help you, became far less of a priority. When I placed a ladder down somewhere, it was because <em>I</em> needed a ladder there--and if that helped someone else out, great. I’d contribute to the creation of certain roads because I needed the last leg of my journey to go as smoothly as possible. If my actions helped complete a larger section of highway, fantastic, but that wasn't my objective.</p><p dir="ltr">In On The Beach, however, because I have so much potential to move more materials with greater ease, I’m finding myself compelled to complete the game’s highway and monorail systems for the sake of completing them. I’m finding myself more strategically deciding where to place a shelter in the wild that provides the most optimal point in the region to take a breather not only for myself and to mitigate any immediate "friction," but for every other player who might have that shelter pop into their game.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this was seemingly on the mind of the developers at Kojima Productions during production of the game, as Death Stranding 2 has an entirely new branch of side missions known as Aid Requests. While these include the familiar side cargo deliveries and pickup requests of the first game, they also include asks such as building a specific kind of infrastructure or placing a certain kind of tool in a particular location. The game doesn’t just want you to do deliveries; it wants you to fix the world. And in this there’s a new kind of friction to be found--one that takes the micro decision making of the first game and blows it up to a macro scale.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know you’ve been working, as hard as you can. To preempt the question, the expectation, and I understand.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738"></a><figcaption>Every little bit helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This overarching mission further incentivizes you to make additional deliveries, as doing so improves your standing with the various recipients, who will in turn allow you to take greater amounts of materials from their supplies. The game's new mining facilities and monorail tracks, which allow you to fabricate a large amount of materials and then deliver them via rail, also contribute this new goal, as they give you the ability to multitask and more quickly generate the means to help others.</p><p dir="ltr">But these stakes and transporting larger quantities of deliveries and materials come with inherent dangers too, as you are placing all your proverbial eggs in one basket. The terrain featured in the game feels even more dynamic than that of the first, requiring you to smartly navigate its, at points, treacherous paths. I have, on more than one occasion, been so reckless while trying to get somewhere quickly that my truck sustained enough bumps to severely damage my cargo, or in some cases, completely destroy it.</p><p dir="ltr">And when I <em>do</em> lose those materials, the sting is even greater, because now, I’ve not only let myself down, but myriad other players as well. It’s a feeling that resonates even harder thanks to the times we live in, where the institutions meant to help and protect us are either weaponized against us or being stripped for parts. It’s clear to me that the only path to a brighter future is one forged by individuals coming together to protect their loved ones and having empathy for complete strangers who are just trying to do the same. Death Stranding 2 brings that mission front and center, and when I fail it, I can’t help but be reminded of what happens if we fail in the same way in our own lives where, to me, failure is not an option.</p><p dir="ltr">“So don’t you worry. All things must end. There are sunlit uplands around the riverbend.”</p><p dir="ltr">While I agree that there might be less asked of the player in each individual delivery, I personally appreciate how the game has expanded on the foundation of the first Death Stranding. It pushes its various systems in appropriate directions that feel like a natural progression, placing additional emphasis and importance on its collaborative gameplay. I imagine that expansion felt like an expectation to the game’s development team, but I wonder if they expected that direction to stir up such feelings. Given Kojima’s track record of prescience regarding societal progression and understanding of the human condition, striking that chord of emotion was likely also a natural side effect of this destined gameplay evolution. In the narrative, even more responsibility to save the world is placed on the shoulders of its protagonist, which is then mirrored in the literal placement of even more objects on Sam’s back. But Death Stranding 2 makes it clear that if we all pull together, that weight can be lifted.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's not magic brain science to suggest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is going to be big, but one investment firm has suggested it's going to be big to the tune of $7.6bn in just two months, while also securing the accolade of "largest gaming release of all time." 
</p>
<p>
That's according to Josh Chapman, managing partner at "thesis driven investment firm" Konvoy Ventures (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/">GameSpot</a>). Chapman shared his predictions <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/">over on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting GTA 6 will be the "largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Chapman believes Grand Theft Auto 6 will generate $7.6bn USD in revenue in the first 60 days of its launch, and that it'll recoup its development costs in under a month. It's worth noting, however, all this is based on certain unconfirmed assumptions. Chapman's maths assumes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">base version of GTA 6 will cost $80</a> (neither Rockstar nor publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> have announced a price yet, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">certainly</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">precedent</a>), and his predictions are also based on a speculative development budget of $2bn - a figure that's long been rumoured, but never actually confirmed.

<p>
Things then veer away from the financial to the perhaps a little fanciful, with Chapman calling GTA 6 the 'next user-generated platform'. More specifically, he predicts it'll "have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>] and Roblox)", alongside "200-person lobbies [with] higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily."
</p>
<p>
None of that's particularly far-fetched, of course, but neither is it supported by any real evidence, but given Chapman notes, "In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released", there's maybe a bit of room for some enthusiastic wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May next year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay in May</a>. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as Take-Two confirmed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Assassin's Creed live-action TV series has been officially greenlit by Netflix, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4tiTYS8oDJ3ygEoJHIyrdQ/netflix-greenlights-assassins-creed-liveaction-series">confirmed</a> today.</p>



<p>The show, which will follow characters across pivotal historical events as they get involved in the sceret war between two faction, one determined to shape humanity's future through control, the other fighting to preserve free will, essentially running with the same premise of the video game series focused on the long way between the Assassins and the Templars, is the first series to be developed under the agreement signed back in 2020 between Ubisoft and Netflix to produce content based on the popular series. Emmy nominees Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing) are set as creators, showrunners, and executive producers of the newly announced show.</p>



<p><em>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us,"</em> said David Wiener and Rober Patino in a statement. <em>"Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</em></p>



<p>The latest entry in the Ubisoft series is Assassin's Creed Shadows.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-reportedly-trying-%E2%80%9Chail-mary%E2%80%9D-tactics-to-make-its-lawsuit-against-palworld-makers-stick.1246233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">confirmed it would be suing Pocketpair</a>, the studio behind last year's massive hit Palworld, many saw this as an inevitable outcome considering how litigious Nintendo is on a good day.</p>



<p>While the suit is still ongoing, and Pocketpair has already been forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">make changes to Palworld</a> based on the patents Nintendo is claiming Pocketpair is infringing on, a new report from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/">Gamefrays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nintendo-is-taking-desperate-measures-in-patent-infringement-case-against-palworld-and-its-looking-a-little-weird">Windows Central</a>) seems to show that Nintendo is doing everything and anything to make its suit against Pocketpair stick, even going so far as to change the patents it claims Pocketpair is infringing on, mid-suit. </p>



<p>Gamefrays does stipulate that changing a patent in the middle of an infringement suit isn't entirely unheard of, though it's usually done when the patent owner is concerned that its original patent will be found to have been invalid in the first place. It also doesn't necessarily mean that Nintendo is on the back foot or that it'll lose the case. Though, Gamefrays does point out that Nintendo's new language for the patent is awkward at best, which makes the change all the more weird.</p>



<p>Gamefrays calls out Nintendo's use of the phrases "<em>even when</em>" and "<em>even if</em>," neither of which is common when writing patents, nor are they clear to define in patent law. According to its report, Gamefrays calls the use of the word "<em>even</em>" and Nintendo's changes to the patents a "<em>Hail Mary</em>" move to try and secure a win for its suit in Japan. </p>



<p>Another unfortunate update on the lawsuit for Nintendo, is that it doesn't seem like it'll be able to bring a suit against Pocketpair in the US. The changes Pocketpair has already made, and the evidence Pocketpair is presenting around games with similar mechanics to Palworld that Nintendo has not gone after, all seem to be the immovable objects blocking Nintendo's path to suing Pocketpair in the US. Not that it won't keep trying, of course. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is finally moving forward at Netflix, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the series, which will be helmed by showrunners and co-creators Roberto Patino and David Wiener, has been given the green light, although there's no word of a release date or even a release window yet.</p>

<p>Patino says the goal with the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is to create "something undeniable for fans all over the planet", promising to highlight the franchise's focus on "people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith" underneath the "scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills".</p>

<p>It isn't yet clear which of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s many time periods the show will focus on. According to its official logline, the show "follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny", so it's very possible we'll be seeing multiple historical periods, which would be interesting.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series focuses on just one period, though, my money's on Renaissance-era Italy and the story of Ezio, since he's probably the franchise's most popular protagonist.</p>

<p>Of course, given that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count" rel="nofollow">set a new Steam record for the franchise</a>&nbsp;and that sales for the modern action-RPG titles are strong across the board, we could well see&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow"><em>Origins</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a></em>,&nbsp;adapted instead.</p>

<p>It will find a landscape newly receptive towards streaming adaptations of gaming properties, with shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow">various other properties</a>&nbsp;making their way to streaming services in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether the series turns out better than the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassins-creed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">somewhat ambivalently-received</a> movie remains to be seen, and since we don't know when the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix show will air, it might be a while before we find out.

Except the most important 30 milliseconds.” He goes on to say that remake developer Vicarious Visions “completely botched how jumping works.” That’s fighting words where I come from (Hillcrest, represent). But he’s got some numbers to back him up. Here’s his explanation of the difference between how jumping works in <em>Crash </em>1996 and the recent remakes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons–pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input [...] So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we’d subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input.</p></blockquote><p>He sums this up by saying “Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. [The game] intercepted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.”</p><p>This is the difference. But I’m kinda skeptical this morning, the 17th of July in the year of our lady 2025. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Andy Gavin for more details.</p><p>After some quick testing, I’m either missing some delicate nuance that I’d go so far as to say is negligible, or, Andy, I have to wonder if we’re playing the same remake? Check your LinkedIn messages, I’m curious about the specific differences in actual gameplay instances. </p><p>Granted, I tested things out on a PC with a Bluetooth Xbox controller using a backup of the original game’s image running in RetroArch with a Beetle PSX core. I then timed my jumps in each game to a metronome and jumped every “whole note” (I’m a musician, that’s how you’re going to get accurate timing from me). Some of you are probably freaking out: This is a horribly inaccurate way to drill down into the specifics of a 30-60 millisecond. Until I can devise a <em>Mythbusters</em>-grade testing unit complete with a robot that times a button press at an exact specified time (and then something that blows it all up), I can’t say for certain, but the jumps feel more similar than Gavin’s assertion that the remake only contains “maximum height” jumps. I mean, here’s another gif showing smaller jumps in motion on both games: </p><figure id="" data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Left: Remake.

But also, as my colleague and <em>Kotaku</em> senior reporter Ethan Gach mentioned in our work Slack, <em>Mario</em> had different jump heights based on how long you held the button, so how unique is the <em>Crash </em>jump anyway? I also recently replayed these remakes. I and many other long-time <em>Crash</em> fans typically admit, this collection feels very accurate to the original 1990s-era experience.</p><p>I’ll get back to you if and when I learn more about <em>Crash</em>’s attempts to defy gravity.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482]]></content:encoded>
