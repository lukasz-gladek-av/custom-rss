                <p>Arguably the coolest Nintendo Lego set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, had been unavailable at Amazon earlier this month (a common occurrence), but now it's back in stock--and with a <em>slight </em>discount as well. Normally $270, Amazon's latest restock shaves the price to $262. While a savings of $8 isn't much, at least it's something considering we actually have <em>never </em>seen a discount on the Lego NES at Amazon. In the event that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> sells out again, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can also find it at Target</a> for the same price.</p><p>If you thought this Lego set could be purchased for less than $270 at one point, you'd be correct. Released in 2020 with a launch price of $230, the Lego NES was one of many sets that received substantial price hikes in 2022. For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all. Major retailers--sometimes all of them--are constantly sold out of the Lego NES.</p><p>It's not the only hard-to-find Lego Nintendo set. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block</a> has disappeared from most retailers this year, and Lego retired the $200 building kit in July. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good/1100-6525901/" data-ref-id="1100-6525901">Amazon just restocked this set as well</a>--perhaps for the last time.</p><h2>Lego Nintendo Entertainment System</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352624"></a><figcaption>Lego Nintendo Entertainment System</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Lego's take on Nintendo's iconic console doesn't just include a buildable version of the machine, it also throws in all the pieces you'll need to build an old-school CRT TV and stand, NES controller, and a Super Mario Bros. NES cartridge as well. The end result is a surprisingly intricate display piece, full of interactive elements like a working cartridge slot, rotating dials on the CRT TV, and a crank-operated screen that emulates a Super Mario level. It also has a very charming secret that will delight long-time fans.</p><p>This is one of only a handful Lego Nintendo display pieces on the market--the playsets are wildly different--and if you're looking to get the complete collection or spoil a Lego fan in your life, you can't go wrong with the handful of other kits currently available.</p><h2>Lego Nintendo Display Sets</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615"></a><figcaption>Lego Super Mario Question Block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon</a> (2,064 pieces) -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi at Target (1,215 pieces)</a> -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $270 | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6379558-Super-Mario-The-Mighty-Bowser-71411-Building-Toy-Set%2F321283899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranaha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $60 price</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgreat-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Zelda - The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 (2,500 pieces)</a> -- $300</li></ul><p>Mighty Bowser is quite expensive at $270--but it is gigantic when fully constructed--so as a Koopa King alternative, we'd recommend the adorable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Bowsers-Muscle-Expansion-Collectible/dp/B0CGY1MQFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Bowser Muscle Car</a> for a cute and compact take on the Mario Rival.

The Stealth 700 sounds a little more rudimentary than that (though also much less finicky), but its specs are pretty robust with 60mm drivers that are 10mm larger than the last-gen model, simultaneous Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity for phone / Discord use, spatial audio, a noise-canceling microphone (that apparently uses “AI”), and a claimed 80 hours of battery life. </p><p>The dedicated PC model offers higher 24-bit / 96kHz audio and a 16-bit / 32kHz mic, as the current consoles are limited to 16-bit / 48kHz for audio and 16-bit / 16kHz for mics. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>All three versions of the Stealth 700 Gen 3 will be available in black, with the Xbox variant also offered in cobalt and the PlayStation model offered in white.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Turtle Beach</cite></p></div></div><p>Another strange connectivity anomaly is that the Xbox version is cross-compatible with PlayStation / PC, but the PlayStation and PC models don’t work with Xbox (yet the PlayStation model works with PC, and the PC one works on PS5 / PS4). Microsoft and Sony’s proprietary licensing for their respective consoles likely plays a role in that bit of confusion — <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Nuanced compatibility restrictions aside, the new Stealth 700 sounds like a simple yet brute force method for a multiplatform gamer to use one headset across systems without constantly moving around a USB receiver or repairing Bluetooth. It’s definitely a little more flexible than the Astro A50 X’s demand that your headset be the central hub for all your systems, especially if your console and PC setups are in different rooms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix have announced that Final Fantasy XVI will be coming to both Steam and the Epic Game Store on September 19th 2024. The whet your appetitive there is a free demo available right now on both stores, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for EGS,</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2738000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for Steam. </a></p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI “DELIVERANCE” - PC Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2WT_0m0dsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As usual there are a couple of variations of the release.&nbsp; Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition &nbsp;includes the base game, or the Complete Edition &nbsp;includes the exciting DLC chapters “Echoes of the Fallen” and “The Rising Tide” at a discounted price. You can also buy the DLC chapters individually or as part of the Final Fantasy XVI Expansion Pass, which includes both chapters. All of these will be available on launch day.</p>
<p>If you pre-oder the game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store will also receive the following in-game DLC items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Blade Weapon</li>
<li>Cait Sith Charm (Gil Boost Accessory)</li>
<li>“Sixteen Bells” Orchestrion Roll</li>
</ul>
<p>The game originally launched in June 2023 on PlayStation 5 and we gave it a whopping<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/"> 9/10 in our review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>“If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you,” said Nic. “Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

<p>If you need even more convincing you should get the game then let me remind you it won our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year foe 2023</a>.</p>
<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

<p>Following the game’s most recent update, in which developer Starbreeze Studios released the Houston Breakout DLC, featuring a brand-new heist, tailor pack, and weapon pack, if you purchase the entire Chapter 3 bundle, some players cannot join a lobby. It’s becoming more widespread with each passing minute. Here are some potential fixes for the failed to fetch game config in Payday 3!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-failed-to-fetch-game-config-in-payday-3">How to (Potentially) Fix Failed to Fetch Game Config in Payday 3</h2>



<p>If you’re among the many suffering from this bug that’s plagued the game since its launch, you’re not alone in dealing with it today. Countless players cannot get into a game because of the “game config” error in Payday 3. While not guaranteed, here are a few potential fixes for the problem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create an entirely new Starbreeze account and link it to your game via Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation.</li>



<li>Verify the game files on Steam by right-clicking the game in your library, selecting Properties, then Installed Files, and then “verify integrity of game files.” It will need to check every file, so be patient!</li>



<li>If that doesn’t work, delete the contents of the % appdata%LocalPAYDAY3 folder and attempt to verify the game files once more.</li>



<li>Attempt to log in repeatedly until it connects.</li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly not ideal, some of these fixes may help you finally check out the new content in the Houston Breakout DLC!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-the-game-config-error-in-payday-3">What Causes the Game Config Error in Payday 3?</h2>



<p>It’s unclear precisely what causes the failed to fetch game config error in Payday 3. Some users report it as a problem with their internet connection. More often than not, however, it’s on Starbreeze’s end. It’s not your fault.</p>



<p>Even worse, Starbreeze has not yet addressed the problem, as far as we’ve seen. Many experienced it on launch day, and here we are, nearly a year later, with the problem persisting for many players.</p>



<hr>



<p>Payday 3 is a bit of a mess, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze fired its CEO</a>, but we’re hopeful the team can turn things around and create a cooperative heist game for the ages!</p>

The moments in between, however, aren't quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws."</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate 2C vs. Ultimate Controller</h2><p>The Ultimate 2C is the budget version of 8BitDo's flagship Ultimate controller, which is our pick for the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a></strong>. The Ultimate supports three custom profiles and offers handy internal customization settings via 8BitDo's app, including macro support, full button mapping, adjustable trigger and rumble sensitivity, and analog stick stick deadzones. The Ultimate has a pair of remappable back buttons, whereas the Ultimate 2C's extra buttons are on top next to the triggers. In addition to the controller, you get a charging stand with a compartment to store the dongle.</p><p>You can get the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller for Switch, PC, and mobile for $48</a></strong> (was $60) at Amazon right now. The Bluetooth model also supports 2.4GHz wireless via a dongle. Three's also a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.4GHz wireless version</a></strong> without Bluetooth for PC and mobile for $45 (was $50). 8BitDo recently released the Ultimate "3-mode," which is a bit more confusing. It is technically an officially licensed Xbox controller, though it only works via a wired connection on Xbox. It does, however, support wireless on PC with the included 2.4GHz dongle and Android with Bluetooth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219?t=-rx6Q_9ptJcZJYDfNIcunA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate2 on X</a>, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be released on PC and Xbox as a timed exclusive in December 2024. The timed window is supposedly six months, and a planned release on PlayStation 5 is planned for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming purchased MachineGames, the developer behind this Indiana Jones game after it acquired Bethesda in 2021 for $7.5 billion. Because of that, it seems highly likely that the game will be an Xbox exclusive, with the game being available on day one on Xbox Game Pass for both PC and Console.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't know how true this is, as it is purely speculation. We know that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is being showcased at Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will hopefully provide more information about the game and what to expect.</p>
<p>This upcoming action game is being developed by MachineGames, who also developed games such as the Wolfenstein franchise, some Quake games, and, most recently, the Indiana Jones game. Bethesda Softworks is publishing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a game between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this title is in a first-person perspective, with some third-person moments throughout the action, predominantly used for environmental exploration. The game also relies heavily on stealth, where players can control Indiana and use his whip as a weapon and a tool to solve puzzles that allow them to traverse difficult obstacles.</p>
<p>Bethesda and MachineGames announced in January 2021 that the game was officially being developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. Jerk Gustaffson, the Director, teamed up with Gordy Haab to contribute original music and reinterpretations of classic Indiana Jones themes heard throughout the movies.</p>
<p>At the moment, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't have an official release date other than sometime in 2024. It's possible that, with the footage shown at Gamescom, they will announce a release date then. So far, the game is set to be one of the most highly anticipated Xbox exclusives.</p>
<p>With the speculation suggesting that the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 in the near future, it seems as though <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-reportedly-coming-to-ps5-as-microsoft-seemingly-prepares-to-go-third-party/">Microsoft has slowly started weighing up</a> the options of whether to bring the game to the PlayStation 5 or not. While <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/4-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-starfield-and-indiana-jones-arent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Spencer</a> spoke out at the Xbox Business Update, he suggested that four exclusives were being ported to other platforms but didn't mention which ones. This has given the audience plenty to speculate on, but we'll have to wait and see what the footage from Gamescom Opening Night Live brings us.</p>

Loot includes, but is not limited to, XP, materials, or drops (e.g. Exotic class items).”</p><p>While Bungie didn’t call out exotic class item farming specifically, that seems to be the most popular form of AFK macros lately, ever since players hit peak exhaustion with the gameplay loop required to attain them. Since exotic items spawn with random perks, it’s not just a matter of getting one but of getting the “right one” for the builds you’re running. And with  Overthrow activities in the Pale Heart not being generous enough and Dual Destiny being a lot of work to keep re-running, some <em>Destiny 2</em> diehards on PC started turning to running scripts in the background to farm for them, especially after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-exotic-class-overthrow-tier-4-chest-drop-rate-1851616742">recent accidental nerfs</a></span> made the whole thing even worse. </p><p>The way it works, as you can see from dozens of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/1duhy7f/pale_heart_afk_chest_macro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZZBzG3dNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a></span>, is by loading players into the Overthrow the Landing patrol zone and looting the same old chest that has a roughly 2 percent chance to drop an exotic class item over and over again. Because the chest is close and always in the same place, it’s just a matter of rinsing and repeating. The script can loot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNNxdB0WqWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about one chest a minute</a></span>, which would be mind numbing for a player to do but can make quick work of the farm if outsourced to a macro script that inputs all the commands for you while you’re busy complaining about <em>Destiny 2</em> on the subreddit.</p><p>“Is this allowed?” one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/my_friend_is_using_a_macro_to_farm_exotic_class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a></span> in early July amid discussions of whether this was a bannable offense. “I mean, as long as he’s doing it solo and not hampering anyone else’s enjoyment of the game, I personally don’t see a problem with it,” another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1dyprw3/comment/lcajour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a></span>. “I don’t know why anyone would wanna spend hours actively running around a patrol space for a 1/64 chance to get something they are looking for for a build in the game.”</p><p>Bungie is now making it clear that that’s no longer the case. Most players seem to be okay with this change, and the studio specified that checkpoint macros, which are used to give teammates the same encounter save spot as the main person running the activity, won’t be regulated in the same way. But it still leaves the larger issue of why players were so turned off by the current grind that they started AFK farming to begin with. “Based,” wrote<em> Destiny 2 </em>YouTuber Stefan “Datto” Jonke. “But now it’s time to do something about why people opt for those paths in the first place.”</p><p>“That is indeed the goal,” Bungie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1825586394842149103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back</a></span>. “We have some changes to XUR coming that we announced last week, and the team is continuing to look at opportunities for improvement.  Know it can be frustrating, but increased feedback/data to show the problem helps a lot, rather than resorting to Macros.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
