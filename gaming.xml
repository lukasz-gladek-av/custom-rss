  <p id="YRmAp7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is hosting a fire-type event that encourages you to walk around and hatch eggs called “<strong>Scorching Steps</strong>” from <strong>June 21-25</strong>. </p>
<p id="pNnZaa">You’ll get doubled candy from hatching eggs throughout the event. Eggs put into Incubators during the event will also have a halved hatch distance. The first three eggs you hatch using the Pokémon Go egg hatching widget will also be cut to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> the usual distance.</p>
<p id="bha1iC">Notably, <strong>Larvesta </strong>can appear as <strong>shiny </strong>for the first time, alongside its evolution <strong>Volcarona</strong>. There’s also an increased chance to find and hatch Slugma and Litleo shiny.</p>

<p id="wi5ti2">Finger Ruins of Rhia is a massive crater filled with Fingercreepers and Snakemen. Near the northern end of the crater is a ritual site of four standing stones shaped like fingers, with a Hanging Bell at its center. Simply walk up to the bell, where you’ll be prompted to “Sound the hanging bell.” You’ll receive the <strong>Crimson Seed Talisman +1</strong>.</p>
<p id="mkwpD0">Once completed, return to Ymir, who will give you another Ruins Map.</p>
<p id="9YagiG"><strong>Ruins Map (2nd)</strong> points you to <strong>Finger Ruins of Dheo</strong>, east of the Hinterland in Scaduview. The Hinterland and Scaduview are accessible through <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180868/shadow-keep-walkthrough-dlc-sote">Shadow Keep</a>. From the Shadow Keep, Back Gate Site of Grace, walk north, where you’ll see a side passage to the east that leads to a headless statue of Marika. At this altar, you’ll need to use the “O Mother” gesture to open a secret passageway leading to the Hinterland site of grace.</p>

<p id="Qdzm9W">If you chose the Iris of Grace option and have the Swordhand of Night Jolán Spirit Ashes, you should teleport back to the Hinterland Site of Grace in Scaduview, then head east to the Shaman Village. This quiet, flower-covered peak abuts Rabbath’s Rise in Scadu Atlus below. From the east corner of Shaman Village, you’ll need to jump down a handful of ledges, then jump to a balcony on Rabbath’s Rise, where you’ll find Anna’s puppet — the physical manifestation of Swordhand of Night Anna.</p>
<p id="juO06B">Interact with Anna’s puppet and you’ll see the prompt “Usher Anna into Swordhand of Night Jolán’s spirit ashes?” Selecting “Yes” will transform the Swordhand of Night Jolán Spirit Ashes into the Jolán and Anna spirit ashes — meaning, you’ll summon two Swordhand of Night spirits when using the ash. You’ll also have the option to revert this Spirit Ashes upgrade, if you prefer.</p>

                <p>Xbox has made headlines throughout 2024 for some of the dramatic business decisions it's made, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">laying off more than 1,000 people and shuttering studios</a>. Specifically, many have commented on and passionately reacted to the closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks. But why close Tango, and what efforts might have been made to avoid such a move? Xbox president of gaming content and studios Matt Booty was asked by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0BWSQo1OEwtS2aW6S2KvHm?si=fEtWWTL_T7qsR2zdq1k4bw&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=ba775835a25640ca" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> if Microsoft attempted to seek another buyer for Tango, and he suggested that this could have occurred.</p><p>He cited an example of how Microsoft once owned Splosion Man studio Twisted Pixel before the team regained its independence. He said Twisted Pixel evolved to no longer become a good match for being an internal Microsoft team, and Microsoft wanted to "set them up for success," so it brokered a deal with the company to let it go private again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hi-Fi Rush Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Booty did not get into specifics about whether or not this could have happened with Tango, but he said Microsoft "absolutely" considers "possible business options" that might be available to have a studio change hands. "Sometimes those things come together, sometimes they don't," he said.</p><p>For Tango, Booty said the decision to close the studio was not made lightly. He said the team's latest game, Hi-Fi Rush, was a "great game" that "did well for us." This came after a report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critically-acclaimed-hi-fi-rush-didnt-make-the-money-it-needed-to-make-report/1100-6513467/" data-ref-id="1100-6513467">Hi-Fi Rush didn't make the money Microsoft was looking for.</a></p><p>Booty went on to say that when Microsoft was plotting out the future of Tango, it considered a number of factors, including the company's creative leadership and if the team is "the same team" that previously made something successful. "We have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p><p>The line about the team leadership and continuity is catching people's attention. In particular, many are wondering if the decision by Tango co-founder Shinji Mikami to leave the company in 2023 played into Microsoft's thinking when it came to closing the studio. We may never know the real reason why Microsoft opted to shutter the studio.</p><p>Booty also discussed how Toys for Bob, one of the Activision-owned studios that Microsoft acquired when it bought Activision Blizzard, split off from Microsoft and is now an independent studio. Microsoft is maintaining a business relationship with the company, though, as it recently signed a publishing deal for a new title from Toys for Bob, and Booty said more details will come in due time.</p><p>Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closed Redfall studio Arkane Austin earlier this year</a>.</p>

The mode is focused on delivering a density of monsters, Blizzard said, where players will battle against huge waves of enemies. Between waves, players will select a boon and a bane that will persist for the rest of the run, with boons granting players powerful buffs while banes will grant negative effects. Surviving enough waves will culminate in a boss encounter against members of The Fel Council, resurrected versions of enemies players may remember from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>.</p>

<p>Blizzard is promising some pretty lucrative rewards for Infernal Hordes, which will be accessible starting in World Tier 3 and will have a total of eight difficulties to choose from. Over the course of a run, players will earn a currency used to unlock rewards from various chests at the end. In addition to new Unique items that will be earnable only from the activity, players will be able to open a chest that has a 100% chance to drop an item with one Greater Affix.</p><p>Infernal Hordes will also be a great way to earn gold, Blizzard said, something that is currently harder to come by and very much needed thanks to the changes made as part of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received Loot Reborn update</a>, which requires large amounts of gold to be used for all its various gear-upgrading systems. Infernal Hordes will additionally be another way to earn Masterworking materials, something that can currently only be earned from the Pit.</p><p>Despite having previously made no promises about future seasons have a public test realm, Season 5 will have a PTR, and it will begin on June 25. Other changes coming as part of Season 5 will include buffs to Unique items, class-balance changes, and more. Season 5 will be shorter than previous seasons, lasting for around two months instead of the usual three. It will end with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, and the start of Season 6 on October 8</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-mid-season-4-patch-will-make-the-pit-easier-nerf-the-seasons-most-overpowered-elixir/1100-6524287/" data-ref-id="1100-6524287">Diablo 4's most-recent update nerfed the season's most-overpowered elixir</a> while also scaling back the difficulty of the Pit to help push players further into the ARPG's endgame.</p>

  <p id="bvIvzh"><strong>Revered Spirit Ashes</strong> are bolstering materials in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> that improve your <strong>Revered Spirit Ash Blessing</strong>, which affects how much damage your Spirit Ashes can deal and negate in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23944154"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
<p id="qFg4NM">They’ll also change how much damage your spectral steed, Torrent, can take — making your journey around the realm of shadow a little easier. Once you’ve found a few, take them to a site of grace to consume similar to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950763/golden-seed-locations-upgrade-sacred-flask-crimson-tears-cerulean">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994386/sacred-tear-locations-map-limgrave-liurnia-caelid-altus">Sacred Tears</a>. There are 24 Revered Spirit Ashes in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, and finding them all can be pretty time consuming, but there are a couple things to keep an eye out for that’ll make your life easier.</p>
<p id="YKAtip">In this <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC guide, we’ll show you <strong>where to find all Revered Spirit Ashes</strong> and list the locations of every Revered Spirit Ash.</p>

<p id="VUD2gg">There is one major landmark that you should look out for when you’re in need of Revered Spirit Ashes — <strong>a corpse on a pedestal</strong>. The corpses and pedestals will vary from location to location, but they all follow the same pattern — it’s a decrepit corpse on top of a platform of some kind. These are usually found along the boundary of an area and never in the middle of an open field.</p>

<p id="icySD8">There are two enemies you should look out for — <strong>Shadow Undeads holding sparkling pots</strong> and <strong>large Omen Shamans</strong>. Shadow Undeads holding sparklings pots will always drop a useful material, whether a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942047"><strong>Scadutree Fragment</strong></a> or a Revered Spirit Ash.</p>
<p id="bQvGce">If you ever notice a lot of Shadow Undeads in an area, there’s a good chance one holding a sparkling pot is nearby. The large Omen Shaman only spawn in a few locations, but they’re guaranteed to drop a Revered Spirit Ash the first time you defeat them.</p>

  <p id="bvIvzh"><strong>Scadutree Fragments</strong> are bolstering materials in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> that improve your <strong>Scadutree Blessing</strong>, which affects how much damage you deal and negate in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23944154"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
<p id="hLW3yL">Scadutree Fragments function similarly to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950763/golden-seed-locations-upgrade-sacred-flask-crimson-tears-cerulean">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994386/sacred-tear-locations-map-limgrave-liurnia-caelid-altus">Sacred Tears</a> in that you’ll find them around the map and use them at sites of grace.

<p id="OoSigh">There are two landmarks that you should keep an eye out for when you’re looking for Scadutree Fragments: <strong>Miquella’s Crosses (left in the above graphic)</strong> and <strong>Statues of Marika (right)</strong>. Miquella’s Crosses are typically located beside sites of grace so they’re aso a good indicator for a spot where you can rest and restock on your flasks. Statues of Marika are a bit more random, but you’re certain to find one in a church.</p>

<p id="rrseNm">In addition, there are two enemies you should look for during your exploration — <strong>Shadow Undeads holding a sparkling pot (left in the above graphic)</strong> and <strong>Golden Hippopotamuses (right)</strong>.</p>
<p id="jb7GKs">If you ever notice a lot of Shadow Undeads in an area, there is a good chance that there is one holding a sparkling pot nearby. If one of these potfriends don’t drop a Scadutree Fragment, they will drop another valuable item like a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942048"><strong>Revered Spirit Ash</strong></a>. Golden Hippopotamuses, meanwhile, are a bit more troublesome and hard to come by than your average Shadow Undead, but they’re guaranteed to drop a Scadutree Fragment.</p>
<p id="wjKj18">Of course, these aren’t the only ways you can find Scadutree Fragments, which can be just about anywhere, but hopefully these landmarks and enemies will help you get stronger in the Realm of Shadow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183254/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-blackgaol-knight-memes-jokes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3nTV6e">It’s release day for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, which means that the world gets to find out what game director Hidetaka Miyazaki meant when he <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/">warned that the expansion</a> would “[push] the envelope in terms of what [the developers] think can be withstood by the player.” Turns out, you don’t have to wait long to see exactly what Miyazaki is talking about. Once you load into the new area, the game throws a boss fight at you almost immediately in the form of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24181797/blackgaol-knight-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat-sote-dlc">the Blackgaol Knight</a>. And this guy isn’t messing around.</p>

<p id="UeoOc4">In my own playthrough, where I’m running a dual-wielding mage, I discovered that this miniboss could kill me in three hits despite my being vastly overleveled for the base game. I had to spend time popping multiple defense spells before walking into the mist just to survive another hit or two, and there was little room for error. One wrong step and the Knight can trap you in a multi-hit combo. Meanwhile, even with a fully upgraded sword, I was barely dealing any damage. Powerful, borderline OP spells like Rock Sling were useless thanks to their long wind-up time, and the knight isn’t susceptible to any type of status effect. You also can’t summon a spirit ash to help you in battle. He is, in other words, a hard skill check that is meant to give the player a sense of whether or not they are ready to take on the rest of the enormous DLC. </p>
<p id="NEiXqj">Veteran players of FromSoftware games and their ilk would expect nothing less in a series infamous for kicking the player’s ass, but still, it’s been amusing to see the community reaction to a boss who exists with the express purpose of wiping the floor with you. After all, it’s been two years since the release of the base game. Some players are jumping in and basically having to relearn everything, only to be harshly reminded of how much their <em>Elden Ring</em> skills have atrophied.</p>
<p id="Sa1ifY">“Forgot how much I suck at this game when I don’t know the enemies,” reads the top-voted comment on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dkppp5/shadow_of_the_erdtree_launch_day_megathread/">stickied <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> megathread on r/EldenRing</a>. The replies are largely in agreement. “Nothing like getting beat to death by a Carian troll that you feel like you really shouldn’t lose to by this point,” another Redditor chimes in. “Everything hits like a tank,” reads another top comment in that same thread. </p>
<p id="QJBxMX">One upshot to the communal suffering, however, is that the memes are impeccable:</p>









<div id="zrL8n3"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qH27Iyg0XuA" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="eVWdoG">The Blackgaol Knight, it should be noted, is an optional boss. While I didn’t have to spend hours bashing my head against a proverbial wall for an enemy so meaningless that he’s housed in a “nameless mausoleum,” I figured that if I couldn’t beat him, then I wouldn’t stand a chance against the rest of the expansion. The kicker? A few hundred feet away from the dreaded knight, the game rewards you with another absurd enemy who can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl1csp/dlc_is_going_great_so_far/">one-shot you in a glorious maw of flames</a>. We’re so back. </p>
<p id="6nLKGd">But for those of you who are still trying to beat the Blackgaol Knight, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24181797/blackgaol-knight-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat-sote-dlc">make sure to read our guide</a>. In my case, I was only able to beat this boss after equipping the Hammer of Haima spell, which hits hard enough to stagger him and, at times, send him flying. I coupled that approach with talismans that would quickly regenerate my stamina, increase my intelligence, and buff up my spellcasting overall. Good luck out there, Tarnished. </p>

It has a nice amount of materia slots, a decent bonus to magic, and looks rather neat (though it does kinda look like it belongs in something like <em>Xenoblade</em> instead). </p><p>Unfortunately, Gambanteinn is far from the most optimal choice for Aerith, but you can get some good mileage out of it depending on what you slot into your weapon upgrades. </p><p>My preferred setup for this staff is to equip ATB Charge Rate Up to get Aerith’s gauges going even faster (which will allow you to start laying down Wards which will only improve Aerith’s many combat utilities), followed by Magic Attack Power +20, and then Reprieve. The last one (which is also available via the Ceremonial Staff—more on that one in a moment) will give Aerith a freebie should she fall unconscious, resurrecting her with 1 HP. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-cloud-best-swords-build-1851547158&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-cloud-best-swords-build-1851547158"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s Best Swords For Cloud</a></span></p><p>That may not sound like a lot, but if you’re quick, it can be what ends up saving you from a Game Over screen. This is where the other upgrades come in handy as our girl will have a faster ATB Charge Rate and greater magic damage (note: All of Aerith’s attacks count as magic damage). You can use that faster ATB Charge Rate to get Aerith and her companions back to full health, <em>or</em> if the battle is particularly punishing, Aerith will revive as a more competent damage dealer than she would be otherwise. </p><h2 id="h144952"><a id=""></a>Magically melt your foes with the Plumose Rod</h2><p>The Plumose Rod comes out as the clear winner for turning our red-jacket-wearing gal pal here into a devastatingly powerful offensive spellcaster.

You should at least equip her with Max HP +200 to make her a bit more robust in a fight. Add to that the Enduring Ward upgrade to increase Ward duration by 25 percent, which will indirectly make her a more powerful spellcaster. You then have a choice of going with Ward Shift Mastery if you find yourself using Ward Shift (the ability that warps Aerith back to her wards) a lot.

<p data-characters="142" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Ruslan Malinovskyi and Amadou Onana Showdown SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em>, featuring an upcoming fixture from the Euro 2024 championships. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has been busy releasing plenty of Showdown SBCs based on fixtures from the Euros. These SBCs have featured cards which can get upgrades in ratings (based on match result). While you can choose to complete one SBC, it’s also possible to obtain both items (if you have enough fodder to complete the tasks). </p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-ruslan-malinovskyi-and-amadou-onana-showdown-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Ruslan Malinovskyi and Amadou Onana Showdown SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">If you want to get both cards, there are two tasks to be completed. Both tasks have different conditions that will have to be satisfied during squad submission. </p>

While Malinovskyi is cheaper to get, Onana will have better chances of getting upgrades (as Belgium is stronger on paper).

<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>League of Legends </em>universe has grown well beyond the bounds of its MOBA origins. Its characters have shifted over to other genres and game types, ranging from auto-chess and fighting games to turn-based RPGs and Netflix shows. So in that respect, Riot putting its champions into the bullet heaven genre with <em>League</em>‘s Swarm mode shouldn’t be a surprise.</p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">Officially announced today, Swarm is the new PvE game mode arriving as part of this summer’s event. The full name is Swarm | Operation: Anima Squad, and as the name implies, it’s not just themed around <em>League of Legends</em>, but specifically the Anima Squad line of skins. For those who don’t play <em>League of Legends</em>, that might be confusing, so I’ll simplify it a bit: these are multiversal versions of characters, like the different Spiders of the <em>Spider-Verse</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Swarm | Operation: Anima Squad - Event Trailer | League of Legends" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOOx4eqNQ7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="771" data-injectable="true">In this alt-universe, the Anima Squad is a cybernetic and animal-themed team fighting against the Primordians to save humanity. You’ll still see names you recognize, between old standards like Yasuo and Jinx, and newer faces like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/league-of-legends-next-champion-skirmisher-bunny-mage-aurora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aurora</a>. The entire event takes place inside the <em>League </em>client, much like <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>. But while the format looks familiar, Swarm will feel quite different, whether you’ve been a long-time <em>League </em>player or just starting out.</p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">We got the chance to go hands-on with the new game mode at a preview event amid Summer Game Fest. I’ve spent quite a bit of time with <em>Vampire Survivors </em>and the many, many games inspired by it, so I was curious to see what Riot was doing in the space. My first surprise was that Riot was building this inside the <em>League </em>client, rather than making it standalone.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="784" data-injectable="true">In a Q+A with the developers of the mode, it was made there because the original prototype was built there. But also, building within the <em>League </em>environment offered some speed. Champions, animations, and other assets are already in the client. <em>Teamfight Tactics </em>was, according to them, easier to make faster within the client than without. And since this is a <em>League </em>event, Riot likes keeping it within that ecosystem.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Riot Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-legendary-survivors" data-injectable="false">Legendary survivors</h2> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">In Swarm, you pick from the roster of <em>League of Legends </em>champions and enter the arena, where you then start walking around and fending off encroaching hordes of foes. You don’t fire (most) of those skills yourself, though. They auto-fire, as you simply steer your champion around the map. And, for a <em>League </em>first, you utilize WASD for movement, while opting to either control the direction of your fire with your cursor or default to auto-aim.</p>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Over time, the enemies get more durable and dangerous, eventually spawning special varieties of dangerous foes and even bosses. To combat this, you can pick up experience orbs that drop upon an enemy’s death, choosing new abilities or boosting existing ones with a pick-three system every time you level up. If you’ve played <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, you know exactly how this plays.</p> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="935" data-injectable="true">Honestly, this familiarity isn’t inherently bad. There’s a reason many other games, not just Swarm, utilize concepts from <em>Vampire Survivors </em>for their own bullet heavens; the ideas are just that synergistic with the mode. Core concepts like picking up orbital projectiles to push back enemies, increasing your movement speed or fire rate, and “evolving” abilities into stronger versions based on attack-attribute synergies all work as well here as they’ve worked elsewhere. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Riot Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">One neat idea are “events” that can happen in the arena, where characters like Yuumi can pop up and kick off mini-games for rewards. They can be pretty difficult, at times, and sometimes involve complicated mechanics to complete while avoiding waves of enemies, like kicking soccer balls into goals. They’re worth it, though, for the upgrades if you can manage them.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Where Swarm feels notably different is how its individual champions move, attack, and operate. More than most other games I’ve played in this genre, champions have core mechanics that define the way they survive in-game. Jinx is your prototypical bullet heaven character, whose machine-gun attacks and hype-up passive mean she gets the zoomies the more she kills, and shoots faster the more zoomy she is. Shoot fast, kill faster, rinse and repeat.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Riot Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">Swap over to Riven, though, and you’re playing something completely different. The broken sword-wielder does a hop-slam attack, metered off how much she has moved. So above all, keep moving. Her abilities encourage this further, giving you shields and scaling well with Armor, so you can get into the thick of the horde and still emerge alive.</p>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Yasuo became a fast-favorite for several people at the preview event, I think. He loves increased odds to critically strike, and can start to really output damage the higher his crit chance gets. Add in his Wind Wall, which can create a barrier and hold the waves of foes at bay for ranged attackers, and he’s a surprisingly effective mix of utility and damage.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Champion identity might be the silver bullet for <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Swarm mode, as each character can function in different ways. The mode is also co-op, allowing up to four players to team up and fight back against the Primordians, and there’s plenty of meta-progression to unlock too, between permanent upgrades to stats, new maps, and more characters.</p>
 <h2 id="h-getting-animated" data-injectable="false">Getting animated</h2> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Riot’s vision for the game mode is also noticeably more colorful and cheerful than the more grim iterations of this genre. Rather than bats and zombies, you’re fending off aliens in bright locales. During our preview period, dangerous projectiles manifested as beach balls that would menacingly roll towards us. I’m not sure if that’s staying in, but I hope it does. There was nothing quite like hearing someone yell out “not another damn beach ball” amidst the rows of PCs.</p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">There were times where the screen got a little hard to read, thanks to how many enemies and colors were on the screen. Contrast could be a little higher, in my opinion. But for the most part, I knew where my character was, and where the enemies were. Following some of the shots and projectiles were a little harder, but it worked out okay.</p> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Riot Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">The character and color extends to the bosses of Swarm, too. Boss fights <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/20-minutes-till-dawn-roguelike-survival-pc-steam-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t necessarily new</a> for the genre either, but Riot makes use of its recognizable roster once again to construct massive, active boss battles. We got to challenge the Primordian version of Rek’sai, which meant taking out tunnels and dodging underground strikes. By the time we got there, our squad was fairly overpowered, but it felt good to fell such a massive titan and do some light raid mechanics, dodging AoEs and focusing targets.</p>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Swarm will no doubt benefit from the built-in audience of <em>League of Legends</em>, and probably appeal to anyone that loves those characters and their Anima Squad skins. As for bullet heaven genre fans, I do think there’s enough here to merit downloading the client and trying it for the low, low price of free. While some core concepts will feel familiar, the way that champion toolkits have been integrated into the characters’ actions works really well.</p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">If anything, I’m curious to see whether it sticks around the way <em>TFT </em>has. The Anima Squad event kicks off on July 17 and runs through August 19, which leaves a short window for Swarm players to dig into all that’s here. Riot made it sound like they’d watch the numbers, when it comes to whether this mode could ever come back. But I wouldn’t mind seeing Riot continue to tinker with this idea. It’s a good one so far, and could get even better given time.</p>
 <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="57" data-injectable="false"><em>League of Legends</em>‘ Swarm mode goes live on July 17.</p> <p data-characters="67" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false"><sub><em>Travel accommodations for this preview were provided by Riot Games.</em></sub></p>

<p data-characters="194" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the Lucky Dragon update arriving in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> on June 26, we’re not only getting Mulan and Mushu as new characters, but also a brand new Star Path to look forward to.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">The reveal of the next Star Path event comes as part of a week of sneak peaks by <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> ahead of the Lucky Dragon update.</p> <figure data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Disney Dreamlight Valley - Majesty and Magnolias Star Path Reveal | The Lucky Dragon Update" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6YdHIIm3Lc?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The Majesty and Magnolias Star Path event will feature items heavily inspired by the Chinese background of Mulan herself, featuring dresses and costumes fit for any dynasty warrior. Or if you want to get cozy, or just bring a little extra luck to your Valley, you can don the Cri-Kee onesie. The choice is up to you!&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Images via Gameloft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">We’ll also be able to get furniture items, such as floating kites, a more colorful set of floating lanterns, and a wooden arch adorned with Magnolia flowers. If you’ve been itching for more delicate looking items to fill out your Valley, this might be the most perfect Star Path yet.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">As you may have come to expect with Star Path events, even Mulan is getting a change of clothes with her green Hanfu being up for grabs as a Dream Style for her.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gameloft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Of course this new Star Path is going to run from the beginning of the Lucky Dragon update on June 26, so you’ll be able to work towards these items while progressing through both Mulan and Mushu’s friendship quests.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">There is no end date for the Majesty and Magnolias Star Path event, though it’s likely to run until the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-disney-dreamlight-valley-update/">next update</a> arrives.</p>

<p>A Special Pack inspired by Lewis Caroll's fantasy novel - the basis for both the psychedelic Disney movie and American McGee's more twisted interpretation (and the live-action Tim Burton movies, but the less said about those the better) - was announced a couple of weeks ago, teasing that the Cheshire Cat will show up amongst distorted Dali-esque architecture and over/undersized objects.</p>
<p>At the time, we were just given a loose ‘Summer 2024’ release window, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4181110370589650890">now been focused down</a> to a release date: July 2nd.</p>
<p>The Alice's Adventures pack will include five new maps to clean up with your sprayer, travelling from the Wonderland Entrance Hall to White Rabbit's House and Caterpillar's Mushroom, before stopping off at the Mad Tea Party and finally letting you un-paint the roses red in the Queen of Hearts' Court. Expect trippy mushrooms, psychedelic colours and a dapper-looking frog in a bow tie, going by the teaser screenshots. You’ll also get a new outfit for friends to admire when playing multiplayer, plus gloves and a washer skin you’ll actually be able to see yourself.</p>

Beyond that, FuturLab have teased a free bit of “Summer Seasonal” content on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4219387168551421256">their 2024 roadmap</a>, which we don’t know anything further about just yet.</p>

Whatever floats your steamboat, PC players. Use your launcher of choice to see Sora go from a starry-eyed child to a starry-eyed young adult who has seen horrors beyond his comprehension. The fun thing about this, however, is that <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans (and haters, probably) now have a new forum to express their love and other feelings for Square Enix’s Disney / <em>Final Fantasy </em>crossover: Steam user reviews.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196742,196452" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the series’ 22-year history, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>has spawned decades of memes, gags, goofs, and, of course, hellish debate. Steam’s user reviews for the three bundles Square Enix has listed on the digital storefront are full of those, as well as folks warning potential buyers about potential technical trouble they might encounter in the ports. A lot of the user reviews are also letting folks know they’re glad to finally have these games on Steam instead of the Epic Games Store, and were willing to wait literal years to play <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>on PC if it meant they didn’t have to use Epic’s launcher. Patience is a virtue, I suppose. Fans waited over a decade for <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, so what’s three years to get almost every game in the series on Steam?</p><p>Ultimately, however, the best ones are the reviews that use ASCII art to recreate the iconic image of Disney’s own Michael Theodore Mouse dressed in an Organization XIII robe and asking a room of unsuspecting <em>Final Fantasy </em>and Disney characters if they’re talking about the Door to Darkness. Shoutout to the multiple users who did this to capture the moment in internet history with which <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is most associated. Here are some of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ best Steam user reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-recommend-id="image://30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="596" data-height="287" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-recommend-id="image://30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="596" data-height="287" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="8188139a84c02fa0c9fa8f12534150cb" data-recommend-id="image://8188139a84c02fa0c9fa8f12534150cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="603" data-height="312" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;We've Done It, the absolute Best Franchise on earth is on Steam.

<section><p>The game looks incredible, especially the new stealth mechanics given to Naoe, but the two protagonists feel like an odd storytelling choice.</p></section>

                <p>The next Assassin's Creed is once again featuring two playable protagonists. However, instead of having the choice of playing as a man or a woman (like in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-482860">Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-ref-id="5000-511540">Valhalla</a>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> takes a page out of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate/" data-ref-id="5000-371539">Syndicate</a>'s book and sees you play as two separate characters: a shinobi named Naoe and a samurai named Yasuke. Beyond the fact that it seems like Ubisoft is incapable of making an Assassin's Creed game with a woman as the sole lead, there doesn't seem to be a good reason as to why Yasuke (a real person from history--a first for a protagonist in the Assassin's Creed franchise) is also playable. Really, I can't see any reason as to why Assassin's Creed is doing two playable protagonists again, especially after seeing 40 minutes of the game in action.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has not done much to explain why Shadows needs two playable protagonists either. In marketing materials, the team has described the decision as its way to deliver both the shinobi and samurai experience, an argument that doesn't hold much water in a post-Ghost of Tsushima world. But I was willing to hold my judgment until I saw the game in action--perhaps the gameplay differences between Naoe and Yasuke are so large, it makes sense to separate them into two separate characters.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows Gives Players Two Unique Ways to Play.</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Having finally gotten a chance to see 40 minutes of gameplay at Summer Game Fest, I'm left more confused than ever--Shadows does not look like a game that needed two playable heroes. The preview that I saw began with a short mission in which Yasuke traveled to a village and took care of the samurai ruthlessly ruling over the citizens, only to then meet up with Naoe and discuss the best way for taking out the corrupt official in charge of said samurai. At that point, the demo covered the subsequent mission, but in three different ways. First, I saw Naoe infiltrate the official's castle under the cover of darkness and stealthily take out guards without raising any alarm. Next, I saw Yasuke go through the same castle but during the day, muscling through guards and breaking down locked doors like a raging bull. And finally, I saw Naoe once again go through the castle but this time during the day and taking a more direct approach that saw her fighting enemies out in the open rather than hiding in the shadows.</p><p dir="ltr">That last segment really baffled me because it provided proof that even though Naoe could not take on groups of guards as easily as Yasuke, it showcased that she <em>could </em>fight groups of enemies. And if Naoe can tackle the game from both a stealthy and open approach, then it questions why Yasuke is even in the game at all.</p><p dir="ltr">What makes it even weirder is that Naoe's gameplay just looks way better than Yasuke's. Yasuke seems to play like a generic action hero, smashing enemies with powerful slam attacks, cutting through their defenses with his katana, and blasting fools with a gun. Naoe, on the other hand, is designed with a lot more tools at her disposal, giving her multiple ways to solve problems. She has a grappling hook to flip between rooftops, uses throwing knives to shatter light sources and create patches of darkness to sneak through, can latch onto the ceiling to avoid the gaze of patrolling guards, uses a reed to breathe underwater, has a hidden blade to take out enemies silently, and is able to go prone and crawl along the ground to better hide her presence--her gameplay looks like a feudal Japan take on playing as Sam Fisher. It remains to be seen how smart the enemy AI is--Assassin's Creed is very hit-or-miss when it comes to that--but if it veers toward the more intelligent side, then playing as Naoe looks it will be way more fun than Yasuke. Her stealth gameplay seems geared toward looking at levels as if they're puzzles and the various tools you have on hand--some of which seem to have limited uses--are the building blocks you must use to construct a solution.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322930" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322930"></a><figcaption>Naoe could have carried Assassin's Creed Shadows all on her own.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And like I said before, Naoe can clearly handle herself in a fight, so it's not like she has to commit to stealth for every mission. Unlike Yasuke, who can tank hits and smash through enemy armor, Naoe has to rely on parries and dodges to create openings in an enemy's defenses before quickly striking. It's tricky to tell without actually playing the game myself, but it looks like combat takes on a more intriguing strategic quality when playing as Naoe, as a misstep hurts her a lot more than Yasuke, so she has to be aware of where every enemy is at any given time. Like her stealth gameplay, Naoe's combat gameplay appears to be structured to make every enemy into a puzzle that you have to solve in order to defeat them. I don't get the same vibe from Yasuke, seeing as he seems so powerful that strategy doesn't appear to be a big part of his gameplay. If anything, Yasuke feels somewhat tacked on while Naoe looks like the clear standout.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that said, I should point out that sometimes Ubisoft keeps its reasoning for why there are two playable protagonists a secret for narrative reasons so that <em>could </em>be the case here--even if Naoe is the better gameplay option, it's possible Yasuke brings something to the table in a storytelling sense. Valhalla is the most-recent example of this. In the previews leading up to Valhalla's release, Ubisoft hid the reveal that Eivor Varinsdottir is canonically a woman (despite the last name clearly giving it away) but also the reincarnation of Odin (or "male Eivor"), thus explaining how Eivor technically has both a woman and man's DNA when someone relives her memories. Since Naoe and Yasuke seem like two entirely different people, that's probably not what's happening in Shadows. If I were to guess, I assume whatever new modern-day protagonist we're playing as is the descendent of both Naoe and Yasuke, meaning they'd be able to see the lives of both individuals leading up to whenever they conceive an offspring at the game's end. That's just my little theory though and even if it's true, it's not enough to explain why Ubisoft needs two playable protagonists to tell that story.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322931" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322931"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft claims that Shadows uses two protagonists to embody two different fantasies, but both could have been attached to one character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Again, maybe there's a story-driven reason for why we need to play as both Naoe and Yasuke, but just in terms of gameplay, Yasuke looks to be redundant. It's obviously way too late to change anything now with Shadows so close to release, but Ubisoft should have made Shadows to have just been Naoe's story. It looks like her gameplay could have easily carried the whole game all on its own. Here's hoping Shadows has you play as Naoe more often than Yasuke, similarly to how Syndicate had you play as Jacob more often than Evie.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on November 15.</p>

<p data-characters="411" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the new Jade Shadows update for <em>Warframe</em> has a new cinematic quest and frame as its highlights, the weapons are equally as important. Jade’s signature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-evensong-in-warframe/">Evensong</a>, Cantare, and Harmony weapons are the Yin to Stalker’s Dread, Despair, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-hate-build-in-warframe/">Hate’s</a> Yang. One such weapon in her arsenal appears to be the most interesting to players. Here’s the best build for the Evensong bow in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-mods-for-the-evensong-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods for the Evensong build in Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">The Evensong is an interesting bow,<strong> focusing more on Status Effects than any special attack</strong> (outside of its charged arrows having explosive tips). Every shot applies seven Puncture stacks, reducing enemy damage by 100% and making shots against them have 35% increased Crit Chance. Kills also grant a buff that gives 35% Multishot, increased to 70% if running all three of Jade’s signature weapons. Given the nature of the bow, building for Multishot and Crit hits. These mods should do just that for you:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>Split Chamber</li> <li>Argon Scope</li> <li>Critical Delay</li> <li>Vital Sense</li> <li>Vile Acceleration</li> <li>Rime Rounds</li> <li>Firestorm</li> <li>Malignant Force</li> <li>Cautious Shot (Exilus)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="879" data-injectable="true">The Exilus slot can be exchanged for a mod of your choice, but having Cautious Shot makes <strong>Charged Shots from the bow not stagger you</strong>. Knowing how I use explosive weapons, that’s some good protection against my own poor aim. The other mods here include some elemental mods, primarily since we’ll be firing those Charged Shots and having them explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies. If you want to spend extra Forma and have the mods, swapping any of these to Galvanized or Primed can be a welcome upgrade.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-is-the-best-arcane-for-evensong" data-injectable="false">What is the best Arcane for Evensong?</h3> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Arcane, you have a few options you can take.<strong> Primary Deadhead</strong> is an obvious choice, granting damage on headshot kills which you’ll be doing anyway. Primary Merciless is similar, only you don’t have to think about headshots at all. If you happen to not have either, Longbow Sharpshot will give you nearly the same level of power.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As of <em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>version 2.3, Firefly and Acheron are widely considered to be the best DPS carry characters in the entire game. However, there must always be a ‘strongest’ character, and between these two, one has to wonder which sits at the mountaintop.</p> <h2 id="h-is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Is Firefly stronger than Acheron in <em>Honkai: Star Rail?</em></h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The answer to this very divisive question is actually rather nuanced. Several factors and variables will determine which is the strongest for you. In a vacuum, with both characters sitting at E0, I’d say that <strong>Firefly</strong> is stronger than Acheron. Allow me to explain my reasoning.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">Firefly at E0 has a lot going for her despite her E1 and E2 further boosting her to heavenly heights. She is capable of ridiculous amounts of damage and is very easy to build due to not caring about CRIT-based stats. One key aspect that makes Firefly so powerful is her extreme focus on Break Damage. With such a focal point, Firefly makes use of the best Harmony character in <em>Honkai: Star Rail, </em><strong>Ruan Mei</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">However, this is also a key detriment because Firefly must always Break her enemies to be useful in a fight. While few and far between currently, there are scenarios where an enemy(s) can become immune to Breaks. There’s a very real chance these situations can become more common, and if they appear in any of the endgame modes, Firefly will be in a lot of trouble.</p> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Acheron-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">At E0, Acheron requires two Nihility teammates to perform at her best. Not only that, but Acheron also wants constant DEF Shred debuffs up on her targets at all times. This makes Nihility characters such Pela and Black Swan her ideal teammates. Her ‘two Nihility’ requirement limits her team composition a lot, but she still has more options than Firefly does. Acheron requires a lot more investment to get going, and it’s often weaker than a mid-level invested Firefly due to her focus being on Break. In most cases, an<strong> E0 Acheron will deal less damage than an E0 Firefly if she can Break.</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">When you start throwing Eidolons into the mix, this is where Acheron improves considerably more in contrast to Firefly, especially in the latter half of the spectrum. Both Firefly and Acheron have extremely powerful E2s that are game-changers, but I’d say that Firefly is still stronger due to her E2 granting her free extra turns. Acheron’s E2 just lessens the Nihility requirement by one, which is a big deal. However, it cannot compete at all with more freebie turns. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Acheron-Add.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="956" data-injectable="true">At E4, Acheron begins to close the gap due to the increased Ultimate damage she gets. Since her Ultimate is completely reliant on debuff application, is a majority of her damage, and can, therefore, be used very often in normal battle scenarios, we can sort of treat it like her getting extra turns. It still isn’t the same, but it’s worth considering. Firefly’s E4 is nearly useless and does not affect how potent she is. What still puts Firefly ahead of Acheron is her ability to apply Weakness Vulnerability to any foes she is facing. Firefly is <strong>always optimal and universal</strong> against any enemy for this reason, whereas Acheron is not. </p>
 <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">Once Acheron and Firefly reach E6, however, Acheron is the clear winner. Firefly’s E6 greatly boosts her ability to Break enemies, which is fantastic. However, Acheron E6 is among the strongest in all of <em>Honkai: Star Rail. </em>Her E6 makes her a universal DPS like Firefly, allowing her to become optimal against any enemy <strong>without having to apply any sort of weakness.</strong> Going further beyond, Acheron’s E6 also dramatically boosts the damage of her entire kit<strong> </strong>by turning it all into <strong>Ultimate Damage</strong>. This means all of her traces and gear that buff her Ultimate, <strong>now buff her entire kit</strong>. Firefly does not compete anymore at this point.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">In summary, <strong>Firefly wins against Acheron until they both reach E6</strong>. For the average player, Firefly will do more work, but both characters are still insanely strong and sit at the top of all the others regardless of their Eidolons. You need two teams to conquer <em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>endgame, so having them both is nothing short of a boon for your account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-got-a-new-bandai-namco-logo-on-start-up-saving-our-retinas/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-ring-got-a-new-bandai-namco-logo-on-start-up-saving-our-retinas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="235" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’ve been showering Elden Ring’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC with praise for the very important things it does right from even before it came out, so now it’s time we shower it with <strong>even</strong> more praise for the smaller things.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Bandai Namco recently changed the logo screen that shows up at the start of their games. If you are to boot up the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully-updated</a> version of <em>Elden Ring </em>right now, you’ll be greeted by the Bandai Namco’s logo against a completely black background.</p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">If you’re just booting the game for the first time to learn what the fuss surrounding <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em> is all about, you might be wondering why I’m gushing about some pretty basic logo. That is because you don’t know the very real struggle of being a fan of FromSoft games who likes to play in the dark.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Look, I’m totally down to praising the sun and all, but the original presentation of the Bandai Namco logo hit us gamers of the dark harder than a flashbang straight out of <em>CS:GO</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">The actual logo’s design remains the same — it was no longer the one seen on the meme above — but the switch in background color that gifts us with somewhat of a “Bandai Namco Night Mode” is an extremely welcome change. In a time when brand logos are <a href="https://medium.com/@marsdevs./design-101-the-best-and-worst-logo-redesigns-weve-ever-seen-cf6ca5884c04">constantly changing for the worse</a>, it’s nice to see a pleasing aesthetic change that comes close to bringing actual health benefits.</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Can this change be because FromSoft just wanted a darker colored background to match the creepier tone of<em> Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>? Maybe, but I’m willing to bet that Miyazaki and co. did it out of the benevolence of wanting to allow our unstrained eyes to enjoy the rest of the game. Either way, this might turn out to be yet another important <em>Souls</em> lore-related mystery that we’ll never know the answer to.</p>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false">You can now play <em>Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree </em> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="144" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Johan Mojica Make Your Mark objective is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em>, offering yet another promo item that can be earned for free in Ultimate Team.</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Team 2 of the Make Your Mark promo is live, and a bulk of the new cards are already available in packs. Unlike those cards, getting Mojica is pretty easy. His objective set have certain tasks, all with different conditions. As long as all the tasks are completed in time, the card will be added to your inventory. </p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-johan-mojica-make-your-mark-objective-tasks" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Johan Mojica Make Your Mark objective tasks</h2> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">To get the card, you’ll need to complete four tasks as per their conditions. Some tasks will finish quicker than the rest, but there’s no pre-defined way to complete the set. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Colombian Force:</strong> Achieve a clean sheet in 3 separate Squad Battles on Min.

Semi- Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the LALIGA EA SPORTS in your starting 11.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">The tasks can be completed in three separate game modes – Squad Battles, Division Rivals, and Weekend League. My choice is always the first option as the opponent is controlled by AI, and the match difficulty can be changed. In Division Rivals and Weekend League, the matches can be extremely intense as you play human opponents. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">For a free card, the 93-rated LB item has some decent stats. It can also operate as a LWB or LM, and Mojica could be a starter for Colombia. This card could end up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-make-your-mark-upgrades-tracker/#:~:text=Every%20Make%20Your%20Mark%20item,are%20part%20of%20the%20promo.">getting an upgrade</a> in the future, which will certainly improve its stats, making it more useable in competitive modes. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elden-ring-review-drama</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-video-game-review-can-be-whatever-it-needs-to-be.908151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elden-ring-review-drama<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s a day that ends in Y in a year that ends in a number, so of course someone, somewhere is upset about video game reviews. This week a portion of the peanut gallery flipped its lid about personal anecdotes in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> reviews, which, some insisted, should be devoid of anything beyond The Cold, Hard Facts. That’s a boring and incurious way to do things, but at least it also makes no practical sense. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by John Warren, formerly of Fanbyte and now of the just-launched <a href="https://vgbees.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGBees</a>. First we discuss John’s new reader and listener-supported website, which aims to provide a home to good writing about video games. The more the merrier, we say. Then we hop on the endless merry-go-round that is the question of what a game review should be, as inspired by discourse around<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. If said discourse makes you want to tear your hair out, don’t worry: You’re not alone!&nbsp;</p><p>After that we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week’s Nintendo Direct</a>, in which the company clearly did not get the memo that the Switch is supposed to be crawling across the finish line right now; instead it announced another year of heavy hitters like<em> Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. Finally, we move on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-life-by-you-tectonic-laid-off-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox’s baffling decision making</a> around its supposed <em>Sims </em>killer, the now-canceled <em>Life By You</em>. Then we wrap things up by talking about what it’d be like to party with the loathsome Dung Eater from <em>Elden Ring</em>. I, for one, think it’d be a great time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can replace all video game reviews with long, unrelated personal anecdotes from here until the end of time.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It does feel like early on, what you’re allowed to or supposed to publish is the product review, and then in the aftermath – ha, ha – the audience becomes more accepting of things that dig deeper or that criticize something from different angles or that take a more personal approach or whatever. There’s this weird thing where if you go with the more personal angle – as we saw with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku’s review of <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> – people will be like “How dare you? You’re not allowed! You shouldn’t be able to do this.” But if somebody publishes that same piece three weeks down the line, no one will care. No one will give a shit. They’ll be like “Yeah, sure. Whatever.”&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like we’ve had that happen a bunch of times in the past with other games. Somebody publishes something a little more off the beaten path on day one – or something that’s a bit more critical, is not in line with what everybody else is saying about the game’s quality, or whatever else – and people lose their shit. But then later on, somebody publishes that same kind of thing, and everyone’s like “Oh, this is actually interesting.” Or later on, the general consensus after people get to play the thing kind of shifts to align with that early piece that was more critical or personal. People are like “Oh yeah, I get it now.” And it’s like, man, just let ‘em cook. We’ve gone through this cycle so many times. You’ve got to understand. It’s gonna be OK.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>We’ve talked about this so many times in the industry. I have a personal taste issue when it comes to personal essays where, if it’s 85 percent personal observations and 15 percent actual game crit, that annoys me on some level. But the way the discourse was about Alyssa’s review of <em>Erdtree</em>, I expected to open that thing and find a LiveJournal post from 2004.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There are, like, four lines! It’s barely in there.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>It’s a paragraph! It’s very little, and it’s deeply contextualized. It’s interesting. This is what I want from most crit. I can watch the Digital Foundry breakdown on if the framerate’s good. I don’t care. There are a lot of people who do, and that’s fine. But I want a deeper reading on this. I do want something that scratches a little bit deeper, and if that’s happening on day one – if someone has the wherewithal and the time; she didn’t really have the time, but she had the wherewithal – that’s great. That’s ideal for me.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s also cool for games in genres that are traditionally less accessible, like Soulslikes. I’m probably not going to experience the <em>Erdtree </em>DLC. I have not beaten the requisite bosses in the original game. I’m not going to, and I’ve made my peace with that. The idea that I can hear about this firsthand experience from somebody else and hear their view of it is really valuable to me. I want that more personal element from people’s writing about a game like this, as I would with – and this is a totally different ballpark – a game like <em>EVE Online</em>. These things that I won’t personally experience in the way that they are intended to be experienced, but somebody else will, and their experience sounds really cool and fascinating. I want to absorb that through them and through their perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>And so yeah, it’s just weird to me that people are like “No, it must be this perfectly sterile piece of writing that simply lists what is in the game and says whether it’s good or bad,” like it’s a checklist or something.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John:</strong> What’s also maddening is that this so often happens around games that frankly everyone kinda knows are gonna be bangers. There’s something kind of goofy about “I’m gonna tell you that this thing you knew was gonna be a banger is a banger.” How boring is that? What are we getting from that? So to talk about it in any way that takes your years of experience with games and game development and covering games and playing games and also your personal experiences with X, Y, and Z into account, that’s incredibly valuable to me.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a goofy conversation that I feel like we have every three years.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Every couple years, maybe even every year. The cycle has sped up so much at this point. There’s always a new herd of people that are like “No, game reviews have to be this or that.”</p><p><strong>John:</strong> They have to be objective, whatever that means.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think I’m with you, John, and this is coming from me as a trans person who has edited trans people. I do think there can be a little bit of an xoJane “It happened to me”-style personal essay industry. Definitely I’ve made money being like “I learned about my gender playing X Game.” As an editor, it’s complicated, because I feel like I’m judging somebody’s experience when I don’t want to edit those kinds of pieces or commission those kinds of pieces. Part of me wants to rebel against those because I think it’s such a channel you can get trapped in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John:</strong> It’s something you can get trapped in, and it’s something that I think can get away from criticism of the actual thing. But on the flipside of that, I’ve seen pieces that thread that needle beautifully.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think the thing is, a good writer can thread that needle well, and as an editor, you can help a writer learn to thread that needle well.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, balance things like “You made a good point here. How can you connect it to what you played a little bit more closely?”</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I edited <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22841693/halo-infinite-queer-trans-representation-analysis-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a piece like that for Polygon</a> about trans stuff and I want to say Master Chief. It was a freelance piece, and I was a freelance editor, and I worked so hard on it. I made them do so many edits. They were really great, and the piece came out so good. It was one of those editing processes where I hope that we all felt good about it. But I definitely felt like I was like “I’m doing my job here. Yeah.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>You get such a really keen insight into someone’s very real experience playing or watching or listening to something that is guiding them through one of the most important moments of their life. Renata Price used to work at Kotaku and Waypoint. She wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@brennanrprice/essay-on-valorant-and-transition-c4e337ba6fea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a piece</a> about <em>Valorant </em>voice chat helping her train her voice a bit. I was lucky enough to see a draft of that early, and I felt like it was not threading that needle perfectly, but she got it there. And I think that’s beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few things happening: 1) I might not be a strong enough editor to get someone there. Sometimes that happens. And 2) you’re making a connection that your brain has made, but is that connection real? Did these things happen simultaneously, or are they actually connected? It’s a common trap in a lot of personal essays. They’re happening almost parallel but not actually connecting. When that happens, that’s when I get frustrated. But otherwise, if you can actually thread that needle, that’s some of the best writing that I love to publish and read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> It’s so much more interesting to read about someone’s lived experience with a game than some Digital Foundry “looks good” kind of [evaluation]. But also, if I want to buy a game, there’s room for everything.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Exactly. The internet is enormous. There will always be millions of product reviews of things. There’s room for all of it to coexist and for people to find the things that work for them. The implication, I think, espoused by a lot of these people who are threatened by these types of reviews is that if this kind of writing is allowed to proliferate, then the reviews they’re looking for will go away. It’s an extension of that same gamer mentality of “They’re taking our games."</p><p>And it’s like, yeah, but you’ve gotta understand, even if you feel threatened by this, just numerically, you won’t be affected. There’s not a viable means by which this kind of writing could overcome the thing you already have in abundance. It’s literally impossible. And there are not incentive structures online to make it become possible. People are always going to want product reviews more than they want good criticism. Because product reviews tell them whether or not to spend their money, and money is unfortunately, in a capitalist society, the center of our lives. That’s just how it is.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The colourful title had been due to release this coming Monday, but developers Radical Forge have now pushed back its launch date indefinitely in order to prioritise “the health and well-being of our team”.</p>

<p>Southfield sets players - either solo or together in co-op - loose on the titular island in need of some good ol’ fashioned agriculture, presenting them with a verdant green world where they can plant crops, tend to their harvest and gradually build their humble farmer’s abode into a thriving settlement. They’ll have to do so while contending with both the unpredictable nature of the crops themselves - which can cause effects from shapeshifting or electrocution to levitation or just straight-up explosions - the island’s shifting weather and groups of hostile Ruffians who will attempt to raid their farm during the night.</p>
<p>Having run a closed beta and offered a demo during Steam’s Next Fest event back in February, Southfield had been due to launch into early access on June 24th. Just three days from launch, however, Radical Forge announced that they had pushed back the planned release date in order to address issues caused by addressing performance problems found during the beta, as well as to look after the team.</p>
<p>“We have been working tirelessly to ensure that Southfield meets the high standards that our community deserves,” the developers wrote. “However, it has become clear that we cannot achieve this without compromising the health and well-being of our team.”</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Despite our best efforts, we’ve had to come to the very difficult decision not to release Southfield on June 24th, and delay our launch. 👇 <a href="https://t.co/VxfpwbYusn">pic.twitter.com/VxfpwbYusn</a></p>— Southfield 🌱 (@SouthfieldGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthfieldGame/status/1804183535357460875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>“With a small team, the last thing we want is to put enormous pressure on them to fix these issues for launch and beyond - safeguarding our devs is very important to us,” they added in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2076210/view/4201376568918238486?l=english">Steam blog post</a>. “We also don’t want to release a game that isn’t ready.”</p>
<p>No alternative release date was given for now, with the Middleborough studio saying they would announce a revised early access date “ASAP”.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your continued patience and support during this challenging time,” they said. “This is an incredibly hard decision for us to make, but we are confident it will lead to us making the game something truly special and that reflects that passion we’ve felt since the announcement from you.”</p>

When <em>Dark Angel</em> wrapped in 2002, Alba broke into movies, playing a dancer with dreams in <em>Honey</em>; a stripper born of tragedy in Robert Rodriguez’s <em>Sin City</em>; Sue Storm, a character imbued with 1960s gender-role logic, in <em>Fantastic Four</em>; and a diver turned treasure hunter in <em>Into the Blue</em>, a role that seems to revel in the fact that its lead actor could logically wear a bikini for 95% of the run time. Alba felt the ogling. “The scripts I get are always for the whore, or the motorcycle chick in leather, or the horny maid,” she <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jessica-alba-on-sin-city-typecasting-and-how-homophobia-pushed-her-away-from-the-church">told Page Six</a> in 2005. “I don’t think this is happening to Natalie Portman.” </p>
<p id="gEtEqW">Over the years, a few filmmakers caught on to Alba’s true physical potential, which went beyond good looks. Rodriguez let her character Nancy go on the attack in the sequel <em>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</em>. In 2015, in what felt like a heel turn for a hero arc she never got, Alba played a high-kicking villain in the action comedy <em>Barely Lethal</em>. She even joined Jason Statham in <em>Mechanic: Resurrection</em>, where she lands a few punches (while in a bikini). Still, no one has seemed to see Alba for what should could really be: a devastator, a slayer, and a worthy peer of the Expendables. </p>
<p id="89T6Zy"><em>Trigger Warning</em> lets her rip as Parker Calvo, a Mexican American Special Forces soldier who returns to her hometown to investigate a string of crimes connected to a larger arms-dealing operation and corrupt local politicians. Parker wants to set things right — and get revenge for her father. It’s a setup for grungy action that Alba, no surprise, conducts with extreme brutality. Polygon talked to Alba and <em>Trigger Warning</em> director Mouly Surya, an Indonesian filmmaker making her English-language debut, about breaking out <em>again</em>. With knives.</p>

<p id="qcnqu1"><strong>Polygon: Jessica, it was a thrill to see you in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>. But it made me wonder, around </strong><em><strong>Dark Angel</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Sin City</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Fantastic Four</strong></em><strong>, were people talking to you about making a down-and-dirty action movie? Clearly there were male stars who were getting those offers.</strong></p>
<p id="V9t1Zy"><strong>Jessica Alba: </strong>I always wanted to be Jason Bourne. And I always wanted to be Bond. And I always wanted to be the character in the Tom Clancy novel. But they were always written as dudes! And so this was sort of like wish fulfillment that I got to be in a gritty action movie, but really embracing the feminine and this fierce woman. </p>
<p id="FGgbre">I think this genre is so dominated by men, that when you do see women, you often see them through the lens of what a “badass woman” looks like, if you’re a dude. Often she is pretty stoic, not a ton of emotions. Usually, she has a bob of some sort. She will wear <em>stilettos</em>. She’ll probably wear some sort of form-figure tight dress that isn’t great for action or practical. Or she’s a damsel in distress, and she needs to be saved by the guy. So when I joined this movie, it was really important that there was just a more feminine take on this genre. </p>
<p id="4REsKP">Mouly and I, with the female producers, were like, “What do we want Parker to really be?” So we brought in a female writer, and really built out this world and the characters so that you can get many layers and levels to everyone, so the bad guys aren’t just nameless and faceless. [Parker’s] not just a random person from somewhere. Everything feels very nuanced, and feels grounded in a reality that was important to us.</p>
<p id="8fmfnm"><strong>Mouly, you come from the Indonesian film scene where action is a major space, but my impression is that it’s similar to Hollywood, in that it’s still dominated by men. So what are your touchstones for creating a movie that kicks ass but fits the specificity Jessica was looking for?</strong></p>
<p id="DjIVP7"><strong>Mouly Surya: </strong>Growing up there were not a lot of Indonesian action movies. There were a few, and now more than ever. You’ve probably seen <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22878589/the-raid-redemption-10-anniversary"><em>The Raid</em></a>, which was awesome, but I was raised with a lot of Chinese martial arts movies. That’s what I’m very familiar with, actually. And I think that’s what I was trying to inject into the film. There’s a certain dramatization, there’s a certain kind of, like, awareness of space that I’m trying to get into this movie.</p>

<p id="RSUYe8"><strong>Jessica, in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>, you fight a man wielding a chainsaw. When you are producing your own action movie, are you making requests like “I want to fight a man wielding a chainsaw”? What was on your personal action wish list?</strong></p>
<p id="lQK7hO"><strong>Alba: </strong>My two things I really wanted to do is I wanted hand-to-hand combat and I wanted to leverage more of a dirty, gritty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Step-Step-Easiest-Learn/dp/1569756619/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Step-Step-Easiest-Learn/dp/1569756619/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23947059__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23947059__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">krav maga</a> style. I wanted it to feel really grounded and messy and not so buttoned-up. I didn’t want a ton of guns, in terms of what Parker uses throughout the film. Certainly, if she needs to defend herself, it would just be more interesting to see hand-to-hand combat, I felt like, and [Surya] agreed. We felt like a more realistic way to take out an opponent, especially a guy who could be twice my size, is to have knives. So I got to train with many different types of knives. That was new and fun. And to be able to use knives in the process of hand-to-hand combat was really different — it almost felt like a throwback. </p>
<p id="EXi8uP">There are a lot of movies these days, especially action, where there’s a ton of special effects, a lot of computer-generated stuff, but this was pretty practical. We were in an actual hardware store. I really pulled chaps off of a hook. I really did have to whip it. I had to learn how to whip it properly! And I did all of that in real life. It took a bunch of coordination, but I think it looks great and it feels very original.</p>
<p id="sd1PFq"><strong>Not only do I think you both brought the feminine forward in an authentic way in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>, but there’s room to grapple with other xenophobic action tropes. I thought of </strong><em><strong>Rambo: Last Blood</strong></em><strong> from a few years back, which pit Stallone against Mexican cartels in what amounted to just trite, jingoistic garbo. Meanwhile, Parker is a Mexican American war vet who snuffs domestic terrorism in her hometown. Did you set out to make a kind of retaliation against movies like that?</strong></p>
<p id="DBNzzR"><strong>Alba: </strong>I don’t know if it’s a retaliation to that specific movie, but for us, it was definite retaliation to all of the stigmas and stereotypes that had been put upon women and certainly the Mexican American community and Latinos and how they have historically been depicted. It was just nice to make a hero out of the person that this town would least suspect. They undervalued her and undermined her powers, these corrupt people in this town. To have a hero like her, we thought it would feel just really inspiring.</p>
<p id="5yGsX5"><strong>Surya: </strong>From the get-go, when we got Jessica attached to the script… I always loved her as an actress — I’m sorry for saying it in third person! </p>
<p id="ZTRe72"><strong>Alba: </strong>Wow, thank you! Never heard this, this is good news. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>
<p id="pr6yD5"><strong>Surya: </strong>She has such a quality to her; the emotional part is what Jessica really brings into the role. Parker has always been strong, on paper, physically and mentally. But Jessica brings us a lot of emotion to it — a rage, I would say. Which makes the character interesting and layered and real! That’s what I wanted, that specificity. She embodies the character. She’s fiery. That kind of thing I don’t really see in other action movies. This has a little bit of retro feeling to it, like it’s not made in the ’80s, but it feels like something that could have been made in the ’80s. But you don’t see an ’80s action movie with a main character who is a woman.</p>

<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Elden Ring’</em>s<em> Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC has finally arrived, and players are jumping back into the game en masse to play it. Unfortunately, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>has also broken the game’s popular Seamless Co-Op mod.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Developed by LukeYui, the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510"> Seamless Co-Op mod</a> allows <em>Elden Ring </em>players to play through FromSoft’s epic fantasy action RPG with their friends online without the base game’s multiplayer restrictions. The Seamless Co-Op mod is one of the more popular <em>Elden Ring</em> mods, to the point where <em>Elden Ring</em>’s creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, admitted that the mod had <a href="https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-coop-mod-fromsoftware-multiplayer-changes/">inspired him to re-think how co-op will work in FromSoft’s next project</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Sadly, <em>Elden Ring</em> players who woke up with plans to play through <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>with the Seamless Co-Op mod enabled have gotten a rude awakening. After <em>Erdtree</em>‘s release, the Seamless Co-Op mod stopped working, forcing <em>Elden Ring</em> players to fall back onto the base game’s usual co-op methods.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="true">Fortunately for the millions who downloaded Seamless Co-Op, LukeYui is fixing the mod. In a statement<a href="https://discord.gg/er-seamless-coop-979042878091329587"> on the mod’s Discord page</a>, Yui said that they’ve already finished what they believe will be a successful rewrite, allowing the mod to handle <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>‘s new content. That said, they have not been able to implement all of the original mod’s features yet. Once the mod’s finished, Yui plans to stress-test the mode to ensure it works.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false"> <p>I’m putting all the efforts I can manage to release the mod as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience</p> <cite>LukeYui, Seamless Co-Op Discord</cite></blockquote> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="false">There’s no timeline for exactly when Seamless Co-Op will be up again, but I can say that <em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em> has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">more than enough content to keep PC players entertained until it’s fixed</a>. We’ve got some awesome guides on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-rellana-twin-moon-knight-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">how to beat some of the DLC’s early bosses</a>, find <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-early-weapons-to-get-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">the best new weapons and items</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-starting-point/">where you need to go</a> to kick off the next step of your <em>Elden Ring</em> adventure.</p>

Once you land on a railroad, you’ll initiate one of these two events, which has you taking money from other players by breaking their landmarks or revealing icons in a bank vault. The points you get depend on your results, as detailed below:</p>

At the cost of consuming more dice, you can increase your multiplier to raise the points per railroad minigame, potentially rewarding you with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of points, depending on the outcome. You can also use High Roller to increase your dice limit, but doing this will drain your supply much quicker.</p>

        <p>On PC, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and Quest.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
After a flurry of licensed expansion's PowerWash Simulator doing something a bit different for its next DLC, plopping down the rabbit hole for an adventure inspired by Lewis Caroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. That much we knew already, but developer FuturLab has now knocked back a 'drink me' and splurted out a release date: it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and Meta Quest on 2nd July.
</p>
<p>
Alice's Adventures is PowerWash Simulator's fourth paid expansion, following on from Warhammer 40K, Back to the Future, and SpongeBob SquarePants crossovers. It features five new stages - taking seasoned squirters to a "a topsy-turvy, swizzy, whirly world of psychedelic colours, maximalist décor and larger than life locales" - plus a couple of other bits too.
</p>
<p>
On the new stage front, there's Wonderland Entrance Hall, White Rabbit's House, Caterpillar's Mushroom, Mad Tea Party, and Queen of Hearts' Court- all of which can be admired in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4181110370589650890">FuturLab's release date post</a> - and those arrive alongside an all-new outfit, gloves, and power washer skin. Oh, and there are two new achievements.

<p>
Will there be anything else? PowerWash Simulator's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4219387168551421256">2024 roadmap</a> previously confirmed a number of free content updates are also on the way this year, including a free "summer seasonal" release. While that'd be the perfect thing to tuck in alongside Alice's Adventures this July, FuturLab is yet to share more on its release plans.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Alice's Adventures will cost £6.49/€7.99/$7.99 when it launches for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Meta Quest on 2nd July.

            <p>Champion Shift is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like I’ve been having quite a bit of fun with for the last few weeks. That’s partly because it’s a solid top-down auto-shooter with roguelike elements, and mostly because you can transform into a freakin’ car.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>The skinny is this: you are one of a number of legendary figures (you start out as King Arthur Pendragon) working together to fight your way through crowds of cyberpunk minions. Mowing down waves of mobs and completing other objectives around each stage’s map will gradually earn you randomised weapon upgrades and abilities, before you take on tougher bosses.</p>
<p>Like Vampire Survivors, shooting is automated, although you can aim certain weapons with a bit more precision depending on their attack style. You can also dash on a cooldown, which is handy for escaping hordes of enemies. Most importantly, though, another button will instantly turn you into a speeding car that can plough through foes and add its own modifications like machine guns, rockets and blades. Your car mode cools down on a fairly generous timer, and I’ve found that I can typically carve my way through enough enemies to collect item drops and keep filling my bar up without needing to shift back to human form for a good while.</p>
<p>Champion Shift has been in early access only a few months, having arrived on Steam in April, but developers SRG Studios have now launched it into a full 1.0 release as of today, June 21st. The full release follows the game’s largest patch to date at the start of the month, which added Jesse James to a roster of mythical heroes already including the likes of Sun Wukong, Athena and Gilgamesh, introduced seven new stages - plus a stage selection option - and relics that can be collected for permanent stat boosts that carry across between runs.</p>

<p>I’ve personally only played by myself so far, which I’ve enjoyed a good bit (thanks to the lovely Jason Coles for putting this on my radar), but Champion Shift can also be tackled with up to four people in online co-op. The separate maps chain together into a set of branching paths, leading up to a final boss - which I am yet to reach - though you can apparently continue for as long as you survive against increasing difficulty levels beyond that, too.</p>
<p>Champion Shift costs only a fiver <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2391900/Champion_Shift/">over on Steam</a> - it’s currently cheaper than that due to a sale, too. If you’re at least somewhat intrigued by the concept of "King Arthur meets Transformers", I’d say it’s easily worth that buy-in.</p>

The main gameplay loop requires twitch shooter reflexes but every player takes on the role of a hero with special skills like throwing fireballs or launching automatic turrets (among other things). But what makes the game so primed for a screen adaptation, especially in the vein of <em>Arcane</em>, is its visual aesthetic.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s art direction<em> </em>has a cel-shaded but almost painterly style that those who have watched <em>Arcane </em>will find familiar. It means that <em>Arcane</em>’s animation studio, Fortiche, would already be perfectly primed to translate the game’s aesthetic. That extends to the iconic agents of <em>Valorant</em>, each of which has simple but striking designs reminiscent of fighting game characters in that you can understand the general vibe of an agent just by looking at them. Fortiche would also be perfect for <em>Valorant </em>thanks to the studio’s incredible pedigree when it comes to action. Having just rewatched <em>Arcane </em>season 1, I was struck by how the show’s standout moments are kinetic and frantic fight scenes choreographed with stunning precision. The fast-paced gunfights of <em>Valorant</em>, with superpowers being flung while bullets fly, would look so good in Fortiche’s hands.</p><p>There’s also another factor in <em>Valorant</em>’s favor—its lore. Just like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>’s world-building, character motivations, and general lore run deep, even if the game itself doesn’t always show it. There’s a lot to dig into regarding the central conflict between the agents of <em>Valorant </em>and their evil copies from Omega Earth, all orchestrated in part by the organization Kingdom. It’s the makings of a good yarn, only supported by the agents who each have some wild stuff going on in their backstories.</p><p>All of this lore is only teased at in the game and expanded upon in short cinematics, which has left fans hungry for a deeper dive into the world itself. That’s exactly what an adaptation can do. It means that <em>Valorant </em>could succeed whereas <em>Overwatch </em>continues to fail. <em>Overwatch </em>similarly has compelling characters and an interesting world that the game only gestures at, with lore being doled out in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comics-animated-short-story-1850611926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comics-animated-short-story-1850611926">short stories, cinematics, and comics</a></span>.

However, the long-awaited <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ow2-pve-story-mode-canceled-lifeweaver-rama-1850446499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ow2-pve-story-mode-canceled-lifeweaver-rama-1850446499">story content</a></span> for the game never came to fruition in the way it was promised and no adaptation exists. It’s left a bitter taste in many fans’ mouths.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s popularity is only on the rise, with a console port recently released in beta and new players likely to join in.

<p>You’ll note the overall atmosphere as you first step into the lands of shadow in Shadow of the Erdtree. It’s gorgeous and gloomy. But more importantly, you’ll note in the distance a walking behemoth, and before long, you’ll ambushed by swirling ninja-like enemies from above. It’s chaotic and frantic, and downright entertaining. But the chaos only ramps up as you start tackling the expansion’s bosses. Here is the comprehensive Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree boss order!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-complete-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">The Complete Shadow of the Erdtree Boss Order</h2>



<p>In total, Shadow of the Erdtree features a staggering 77 bosses, most of which are optional challenges along your path to the top. But there are a handful you cannot skip to beat the DLC, and they include:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Divine Beast Dancing Lion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rellana, Twin Moon Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Putrescent Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Messmer the Impaler</strong></li>



<li><strong>Commander Gaius</strong></li>



<li><strong>Scadutree Avatar</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metyr, Mother of Fingers</strong></li>



<li><strong>Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame</strong></li>



<li><strong>Romina, Saint of the Bud</strong></li>



<li><strong>Promised Consort Radahn</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The most challenging boss in the entire expansion is, of course, Promised Consort Radahn. He’s the DLC’s final boss, one you’ve previously faced in the main game, which means players will likely underestimate his strength. Don’t! He’ll stomp through you with reckless abandon in mere minutes, so take the fight seriously!</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-the-first-boss-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Who is the First Boss in Shadow of the Erdtree?</h2>



<p>The expansion’s first boss, Divine Beast Dancing Lion, featuring the best name in Elden Ring lore, proves itself as one of the most capable entry points to the new content. It’s a challenging creature, utilizing elemental attacks to deal standard and lightning damage.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you beat Divine Beast Dancing Lion:</p>



<ul>
<li>When the boss rears up on two legs, smacking its lips together in anticipation, it’s preparing a grab attack that deals significant physical damage. Do not get caught in the grapple; otherwise, you risk a quick conclusion to the battle.</li>



<li>As its lightning attacks strike the ground, dodge-roll away from the point of impact to avoid taking significant elemental damage.</li>



<li>You can parry Divine Beast Dancing Lion!</li>
</ul>
