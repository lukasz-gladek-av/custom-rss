                <p>This week, Dragon Age fans have been able to dive back into the continent of Thedas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Longtime players may recognize that events in the game were foreshadowed some of the previous installments. According to former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider, that's because he laid out of the series' lore years ago in a document that's still influencing the direction of the games.</p><p>"The way I created the world was to seed plots in various parts of the world that could be part of... a single game," Gaider told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "Then there was the overall uber-plot, which I didn't know for certain that we would ever get to, but I had an understanding of how it all worked together... A lot of that was in my head until we were starting Inquisition and the writers got a little bit impatient with my memory or lack thereof, so they pinned me down and dragged the uber-plot out of me. I'd talked about it, I'd hinted at it, but never really spelled out how it all connected, so they dragged it out of me. We put it into a master lore doc, the secret lore, which we had to hide from most of the team."</p><p>Although Gaider left BioWare after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, there are signs in The Veilguard that his original plan is still being followed, at least to a degree. He pointed to the return of Fen'Harel as a major example. However, Gaider declined to state what his original ending for the Dragon Age lore was just in case BioWare ever gets around to telling that story.</p><p>"I always had this dream of where it would all end, the very last plot," added Gaider. " But the idea that this uber-plot was this sort of biggest, finite... That the final thing you could do in this world that would break it was there as a 'Maybe we would get to do that one day.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has addressed the online backlash which has swirled around the main characters of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the subsequent  impact it has had on the game's development staff, and the attempts by bad faith commenters to disrupt and dissuade creative teams from telling stories featuring diverse and inclusive characters in general.</p>
<p>Speaking tonight in London, at an event organised by BAFTA and attended by Eurogamer, Coté offered a full-throated defence of his team's work on Shadows which has come under such notable criticism this year, particularly over the inclusion of Black samurai Yasuke as one of the game's two protagonists. Coté has addressed the subject previously, in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">when the subject was commented on negatively by X owner and billionaire Elon Musk</a>, but never before in such an impassioned manner, in so much detail, at such length.</p>
<p>Discussing the current "shifting cultural landscape", Coté described the current "discussions around representation and inclusivity in media" as an additional and previously unforeseen challenge. "These conversations can influence how our games are perceived, but rather than shy away from those conversations, we should see them as an opportunity," he explained.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, that history is diverse. Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise. For example, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we highlight figures, both fictional like Naoe, a Japanese woman warrior, and historical, like Yasuke, the African born samurai. While the inclusion of a Black samurai in feudal Japan has sparked questions and even controversy, Naoe, as a fictional character, has also faced scrutiny for her gender.</p><p>"But just as Yasuke's presence in Japanese history is fact, so too are the stories of women who defied societal expectations and took up arms in times of conflict," Coté continued. "So while both Naoe and Yasuke's stories are works of historical fiction, they reflect the collision of different worlds, cultures and roles, and their inclusion is precisely the kind of narrative that Assassin's Creed seeks to tell, one that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of our shared history.</p>
<blockquote>"We've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities."</blockquote>
<p>"And this isn't new ground for the franchise," he noted. "From Altair to Aveline de Grandpré to Ratonhnhaké:ton [the protagonists of Assassin's Creed 1, Liberation and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> respectively], we've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities. History is inherently diverse, and so is Assassin's Creed and the stories we tell. So to be clear, our commitment to inclusivity is grounded in historical authenticity and respect for diverse perspectives, not driven by modern agendas."</p>
<p>Coté's tone seemed notably different to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Ubisoft's last, vague mention of "polarised comments" by company boss Yves Guillemot</a>, who raised eyebrows in September when he told investors that Ubisoft was "an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda". Guillemot's comments followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">similarly vague blanket apology by Ubisoft</a> for "some elements in our promotional materials [that] have caused concern within the Japanese community" which also stated that "while Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Guillemot had previously condemned</a> the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Shadows' development team in the wake of the game's reveal.</p><p>"Alongside these deep-rooted franchise values is our commitment to recognise and listen to legitimate criticism as an essential part of the creative process," Coté said tonight. "Our community helps us grow, evolve and deliver better games. Today, we all however face the added challenge of distinguishing between genuine feedback and attacks driven by intolerance.</p>
<p>"The current climate is tough on our creative teams," he continued. "They face lies, half truths and personal attacks online. When the work they pour their hearts into is twisted into a symbol of division, it's not just disheartening, it can be devastating. What keeps me going is the resilience born out of conviction that I see in our teams every day. I am especially proud of the Shadows team for staying true to their creative vision and the core tenets of Assassin's Creed.</p>
<blockquote>"Our creative teams face lies, half truths and personal attacks online."</blockquote>
<p>"By choosing Naoe and Yasuke as protagonists, we are expanding the narrative landscape, offering new points of view that challenge established norms found in many works of fiction, while staying true to the history that shaped them. At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed is not just a franchise, it's a platform for entertainment, dialogue, discovery and understanding. Our commitment isn't just about reflecting on the past, it's about ensuring that the stories we tell continue to unite, inspire and challenge players, regardless of their background, and we'll continue to stand by these values because they are central to the heart of the franchise, and I believe, to the future of storytelling itself. Ultimately, we believe that the diversity and richness of the human experience is what helps Assassin's Creed resonate with players across the globe, and we're committed to standing firm on that foundation."</p>
<p>Coté noted that Assassin's Creed has featured universal themes "like resistance to tyranny and the preservation of knowledge and identity" since its outset, and that it has always featured an opening message acknowledging the game as a work of fiction created by a team diverse in both its backgrounds and beliefs. "From the very beginning, Ubisoft has embraced this diversity," Coté said. "Assassin's Creed is more than just a game. It can be a platform for meaningful exploration and reflection wrapped in the excitement of unforgettable gameplay, and it is that fusion of creativity, diversity, immersion and fun that continues to define the franchise and connect it with players around the globe."</p>
<p>Coté closed with a broader reflection on the stifling of creative freedoms more generally, as cultural differences become ever more divisive.</p>
<p>"Today, the stakes are higher," Coté said. "The stories we tell, the characters we create and the game worlds we build are instrumentalised by those who seek to silence creativity, to stoke fear and incite hatred. I believe we are facing what [author] Fareed Zakaria calls an 'Age of Revolution', a time when the real conflict is not between the left and the right, but between societies that close themselves off and those that open themselves up to the world. Throughout history, it's the open societies that have always eventually prevailed. While there may be setbacks over years or even decades, it is openness that has continually pushed humanity forward.</p>
<blockquote>"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, until freedom and creativity wither away."</blockquote>
<p>"This echoes the selfless bravery of our Assassin's Creed protagonists," he continued. "They fought for freedom, knowledge and the right to chart their own paths, just as we, as creators, fight to tell stories that matter in a world that grows increasingly divided. As the authors of 'How Democracies Die' so powerfully stated, democracies crumble when good people decide to stay silent. The same is true, I think, of our creative freedom when we allow fear to stifle our voices. When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and that help people connect. Our silence cannot become complicit.</p>
<p>"To our players - the ones who have stood by us, supported us and celebrated our work over the years with enthusiasm and constructive feedback - this stance is for you," Coté concluded. "You are the heart of our journey. We create for you, and your support fuels our creativity and strengthens our resolve to keep pushing boundaries, to tell stories that matter. This journey is yours as much as it is ours, and I thank you for being with us every step of the way. I'm an optimist and a dreamer. I believe that the answer to hate is to continue creating experiences that celebrate the richness of our world and capture the magic of our collective imagination, because in the end, creativity is stronger than fear, and together, we are creating the future of entertainment."</p><p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">previously sat down with Assassin's Creed Shadows' art director</a> Thierry Dansereau to discuss the game's adaption of Japanese culture, social media pressures and Ubisoft's controversial apology. "Of course we're making creative choices," Dansereau told me. "It's a video game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Chapter 2 Remix will, as the name implies, focus on Chapter 2--specifically the first few seasons. The season will run for just a month, ending on the evening of November 30, and will bring with it the Remix Pass. The Remix Pass is shorter than a normal battle pass at just 70 tiers, and it includes five skins that are remixes of existing skins from early Chapter 2. That's one more skin than last year's OG Pass included.</p><p>Each week of the Remix season will focus on a different artist. Week 1 is Snoop, Week 2 is Eminem--complete with a new skin inspired by his Houdini music video get-up, Week 3 is Ice Spice, and the fourth and final week will feature a tribute to the late Juice WRLD. Each week will come with themed locations and weapons in battle royale, and new item shop skins for each of the artists. And to top it all off, a cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin will be given out for free to anyone who logs in on the final day of the season, November 30, when the Remix finale event will go down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788"></a><figcaption>Snoop Dogg is headlining both Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 and Festival Season 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg"></figure><p>Over in Fortnite Festival, Snoop Dogg is headlining a new Music Pass with a throwback cel-shaded skin, and he also has a bundle of item shop cosmetics as well.

                <p>Black Friday is still weeks away, but that’s not stopping some brands from getting a jump start on the biggest shopping holiday of the year. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fblogs%2Fpromotions%2Fblack-friday-cyber-monday-2024&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Maingear</a> is one of the first to rush through the gates, with massive savings that <strong>run through December 8</strong>. Along with big discounts on four prebuilt gaming PCs, most PCs in the sale are eligible for free two-year warranties, free shipping, and a Nvidia game bundle that gets you a free copy of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Most of the gaming rigs on sale are ultra-premium models equipped with the latest hardware on the market. The most enticing of the bunch might be the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4070-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4070 Super / 7800X3D</a>, which is seeing a nice <strong>$420 discount</strong>. Along with the RTX 4070 Super and Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, it’s equipped with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and Windows 11. The discount brings it to $1,877--which is a pretty great deal for all those components.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393738" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393738"></a><figcaption>MG-1 RTX 4080 Super / Ryzen 7800X3D</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg"></figure><p>For something even more affordable, you’ll find the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4060-ti-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4060 Ti / 7600X</a> on sale for $1,388 (was $1,666). It drops you down to the RTX 4060 Ti, though it’s still more than capable of handling most games without any difficulty. Other notable specs include 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU.</p><p>At the premium end of the spectrum is the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fzero-lcd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4070 Ti Super / 7800X3D</a> for $2,833 (was $3,334). It’s loaded with an RTX 4070 Ti Super, AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 2TB SSD, and 48GB RAM, making it an absolute powerhouse. It also comes with a free Lian-Li Uni Fan upgrade--a bonus that can’t be found on the other three models on sale.</p><p>These discounts will stick around until December 8, though Maingear notes that <strong>inventory is limited</strong>--so if one of the items is popular, it could disappear before the anticipated end date. Here’s a closer look at all four products to help you decide if one is a good upgrade for your needs. You’ll also find two gaming laptops up for grabs, though their deals aren’t quite as enticing as the prebuilt desktops.</p><h2>Best Maingear Desktop Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4060-ti-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4060 Ti, Ryzen 5 7600X, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,388 ($<del>1,666</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4070-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4070 Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,877 ($<del>2,297</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4080-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4080 Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $2,494 ($<del>2,960</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fzero-lcd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4070 Ti Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 48GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $2,833 ($<del>3,334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fml-16-rtx-4060&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ML-16 Laptop (RTX 4060, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,699 ($<del>1,799</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fml-16-rtx-4070&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ML-16 Laptop (RTX 4070, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $1,977 ($<del>2,199</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

In each week of November, Fortnite will have a waterfall rollout of new map locations "revamped" by the artists, culminating in a finale event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 2 Remix was revealed alongside a surprise billboard takeover of Times Square in New York City on Friday night with performances from Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg. (Ice Spice played "Princess Diana," and Snoop Dogg did "Who Am I (What's My Name)?", "Gorgeous," "Drop It Like It's Hot," and "The Next Episode.") The concert was also livestreamed simultaneously on Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 1 will have Snoop Dogg's touch, remixing the point of interest formerly known as The Agency as The Dogg Pound. It will also bring back the boogie bomb that triggers "Drop It Like It's Hot." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The in-game compound was at least partially inspired by his actual 30+ room compound – converted from a warehouse 10 years ago – located nearby the Los Angeles International Airport, his son Cordell Broadus told press after the event. "[There's a] casino, green room, basketball court, club... He's super creative in the physical world so we wanted to create that in the digital landscape as well," said Broadus, who started the studio Death Row Games with his dad in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted the whole feel of my world being brought into Fortnite," Snoop Dogg added.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/snoop-fortnite-1730501683298.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Snoop and company are coming to Fortnite. Image source: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 2 will reveal Eminem's takeover of The Grotto as Spaghetti Grotto (a play on his Mom's Spaghetti restaurant in Detroit) with a "Rap God" machine gun that spits out lyrics to the 2013 song. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 3 drops Ice Spice's Y2K, New York-inspired Shark Island. Finally, Week 4 will pay homage to Juice WLRD, who <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/how-did-juice-wlrd-die-cause-of-juice-wrlds-death.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died in 2021</a> at just 21 years old. Epic says it worked closely with his mother, estate, and label, Interscope to bring this to life. "Jarad always loved to play Fortnite – it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others,” his mother, Carmela Wallace, said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new season will launch in three phases: on November 1, with The Prelude; on November 2, with the offical launch of Chapter 2, and on November 30, with The Finale, which will be a yet-to-be-announced in-game event. Any players who attend, however, will receive a free cel-shaded outfit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're starting to see artists understand that gaming is an interesting and important place to meet fans where they are," said Nate Nanzer, VP of Global Partnerships, at a press event before the concert. "There's a lot of experimentation bringing music and gaming closer together." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emily Levy, the director of strategic partnerships, said that artists see an 8.7% lift of consumption on streaming platforms after bringing music into the game. "Fortnite has become a necessary stop for artists on their tours, to engage on their campaigns and release cycles," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same event, Fortnite also announced kicks, a new cosmetic item; players will now be able to pick cusom shoes for their avatars to wear. The first will be a classic pair of Air Jordan high tops. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Leanna Butkovic is IGN's Editorial Project Manager.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tonight's Chapter 2 Remix: The Prelude live event has just concluded in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with more than 10 million players in-game and millions more watching via YouTube and TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
As Fortnite's in-game countdown clock reached zero, tonight's event was revealed to be a livestreamed concert held for real in New York's Times Square, where Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg performed in front of a large crowd. 
</p>
<p>
Both singers will join Fortnite's next season, Chapter 2 Remix, which kicks off tomorrow. They'll also be joined in-game by the returning Eminem, who headlined last year's Big Bang in-game event, and who looks to be getting another skin.

<p>
An even more surprising addition, perhaps, will be late rapper and Fortnite fan Jarad "Juice WRLD" Higgins. Players who log in on 30th November, when Chapter 2 Remix concludes with a further live event, will get a cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD skin for free. It's the first time Fortnite has featured a skin based on the likeness of someone who is deceased.
</p>
<p>
"Jarad always loved to play Fortnite - it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others," said Carmela Wallace, mother of Jarad "Juice WRLD" Higgins' mother in a statement tonight.

"From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does."
</p>
<p>
Snoop Dogg also released a statement tonight, ahead of his arrival in Fortnite, beginning with Chapter 2 Remix's launch tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
"Being part of Fortnite is all about creating, playing, and sharing my music and culture with the next generation," Snoop said. "My son Cordell's a big Fortnite player with me, so when we had the opportunity we jumped on it as a new way to connect with my sound and style. Anyone can be Snoop in Fortnite."

Chapter 2 Remix is set to last four weeks, and introduce a new music artist each week, located at familiar Chapter 2 locations. Snoop (who notably is also Fortnite Festival Season 6's featured artist) will take up residency at The Agency, while Eminem appears on 7th November at The Grotto, Ice Spice turns up in week three on 14th November at Shark Island, and a fresh landmark dedicated to Juice WRLD turns up in week four, from 21st November.
</p>
<p>
Gameplay-wise, Chapter 2 Remix will see the long-awaited return of motorboats, with helicopters set to return later in the season. Snoop's hydraulic-bouncing 1966 Cadillac DeVille will also be available, and yes you can make it jump in the air. 
</p>
<p>
A new cosmetic type, Kicks, is being introduced so your skins can wear branded footwear, because of course. Initial brands include Nike and Jordan, with the latter included in the new season pass.
</p>
<p>
Further additions beginning tomorrow include a new map for Fortnite Reload, which includes different landmarks from the Fortnite Chapter 1 map, that will rotate every 30 minutes with the original Reload map. A new solos mode for Fortnite Reload will also debut, where players have three lives total. 
</p>
<p>
One last, long-requested feature: improvements to Fortnite's locker will mean you can once again bundle saved loadouts, with space for 200 now added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/coldridge-indie-steam-pc-4x-exploration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was alerted this week--on Linkedin no less, in case you were wondering how hard it is for a game to bust out of Steam's algorithm these days, even when the game is catered seemingly exclusively to you--to the release of <em>Coldridge</em>.</p><p>It's a turn-based exploration game. Not a turn-based combat game, not a tactics exercise, you don't even build anything, all you do here is push out into a foggy map, seeing what resources and dangers lie beyond, one hex at a time. I've seen others say it's simply the opening turns of <em>Civilization</em> broken out into their own game, and while that's mostly correct, there are a few points of difference.</p><p>It's got the same overall vibes as the beginning of <em>Civ</em>, sure. It's just a scout and the unknown. The thing is, without the rest of a 4X game to follow on from the exploration, the context here is entirely different. Instead of scoping out places to settle and having the freedom to take your time, <em>Coldridge </em>is a roguelite with an emphasis on scouring the frontier for resources.</p><p>Playing as said scout, you arrive at a mysterious and ruthless town, where you're given board in exchange for the completion of a series of contracts. To complete them you need to--yes, you guessed it--go explore the surrounding wilderness, discovering resources that the "Guild" offering you the contracts can seize and sell off.</p><figure></figure><p>Movement is everything here, as the map is only revealed and the resources only secured by moving the player onto a hex. Of course just moving a scout around a map onto some trees and bison would be too easy, so the catch comes in the form of <em>Coldridge's </em>sense of economy: You only get a certain number of expeditions to complete each year, and each expedition only lasts a handful of turns. So you've got to be <em>really </em>careful which contracts you take on and how strategically you make your moves.</p><p>It's a cruel, stingy game! Narratively the only thing keeping you alive is the fact you're allowed to stay inside the walls of Coldridge, and you're only allowed to stay so long as you keep completing the Guild's contacts, which become increasingly bloated and selfish over the course of the game, asking you to claim more and more on each run while facing increasing risk and danger. This makes <em>Coldridge </em>hard; there's one hell of a difficulty spike just moving from the first to second year, but once you learn <em>Coldridge's </em>own stringent rhythms, instead of just trying to play <em>Civ</em> over and over, you'll get the hang of it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Coldridge - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhXA1aqDRH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's all very clean and direct and uncluttered. It's got great art, a snappy interface, some cool music, and it's just generally a very cool idea for a game and its setting. <em>Coldridge</em> has a solid roguelite structure too, which helps with the aforementioned difficulty; every run, even the most disastrous, can unlock new items and perks you can use next time around. The fact it's turn-based means you can take all the time in the world planning your moves while watching the gorgeous little bison and pretty little plains that litter the gorgeous map.</p><p>With such a sturdy bedrock, then, it's a shame that <em>Coldridge </em>felt the need to lean so heavily on its characters and dialogue, both of which are hammy and overwritten and which the game could have easily done without. A more interesting story than the story itself can be found in your actions out in the field; it's affecting to scout for bison in these beautiful, untouched fields, only to see industry come swooping in and strip the map of these "resources", then realise...it's all your fault.</p><p><em>Coldridge</em>--which was developed by a pair of veteran Amplitude (<em>Humankind</em>, <em>Endless Legend</em>, etc) devs--is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time around, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice took the stage — both in the game and IRL at Times Square in New York — and once the season kicks off, the musical aspects will go a step farther. </p><p>As the name implies, the new mini season brings back many of the characters, gameplay elements, and locations of the game’s second chapter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916237/fortnite-chapter-2-new-map-season-11-black-hole-design-epic-games">which launched in 2019</a>. Chapter 2 was notable in particular because it erased the original battle royale map to start over fresh for the first time. (The Chapter 2 map itself would be swapped out in 2021 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news">when it flipped over in dramatic fashion</a>.) The month-long event will change things up weekly, with new elements themed around a different musical artist. Snoop Dogg is up first, followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and culminating with Juice WRLD.</p><p>The remixed version of Chapter 2 begins on November 2nd and will run through November 30th, with Epic teasing a “finale” event to wrap things up. It’s also introducing a new cosmetic item: kicks, so that you can put a pair of Nikes on Peely the banana.</p><div><p>Going back in time isn’t new for the game. A year ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">Epic kicked off <em>Fortnite OG</em></a>, a throwback mini season that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">designed specifically to lure back lapsed players</a>, before the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">dramatically expanded with new experiences like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>. Similarly, music has long been a large focus for the game, with virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, along with a rhythm game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> featuring stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a>.</p></div><div><p>More recently, Epic has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival">streamlining <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle passes to better accommodate all of its many games</a>. Meanwhile, a number of notable places have been crafting <em>Fortnite</em> islands of late, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261095/hasbro-board-games-fortnite">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney">ESPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281908/where-we-voting-boys">the Kamala Harris campaign</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the franchise’s next major entry, Wilds, will surely be no different when it launches early next year, those who hopped into its pre-release beta yesterday are finding that its monsters don’t look quite as they expected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, when a big new game comes out, you can pretty much roll the dice on what kind of reactionary controversy it will produce. Are we looking at a moral panic over trans characters? Diversity consulting? Games journalists being too positive? Games journalists being too negative? Some other quibble that will be forgotten in a week, interchangeably swapped out like grains of sand dragged away by the unrelenting tide? Anyway, the usual suspects got mad about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reviews this week.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours for a full rundown of <em>why</em>, but the whole thing is illustrative of a larger, more important issue: Thanks to algorithmic prioritization on sites like YouTube and Twitter, this is how a growing number of people engage with video games. Plenty of normal people still manage to tune it out the hours-long rants and conspiracy theories, but at what point does this rancid flavor of brain rot go from a vocal niche to a borderline-mainstream position? And what are the long-term consequences of that?</p><p>Also on this week’s episode: We lament <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the untimely end of Firewalk</a>, the studio that made <em>Concord </em>to Sony’s specifications and then promptly got dumpstered for it. Will the industry actually learn from this? We can only hope. Then we move on to more media layoffs, <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time at Fandom</a>, which owns GameSpot, among a sometimes-baffling lineup of other properties (TV’s Guide’s website? Huh!). Oh, and we solve <em>the hell</em> out of what would seem to be an impossible puzzle: How does a worm drive a little apple car?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can grow so large that it becomes the entire internet, supplanting YouTube and other platforms with the kinds of refreshingly chill conversations we regularly have in our Discord (which you can join by <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribing to our “member” tier</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I guess my doomer-pilled concern about all of this is that as the American fascist project continues to grow in power and all of these platforms facilitate these ways of talking about things – conspiratorial thinking and whatnot – do we reach a point where [this becomes the default]? Because I would say that right now, this is still not the way most normal people talk about games or engage with them. A lot of people, as we see even based on <em>Dragon Age</em>’s Steam numbers right now, saw this game, thought it looked cool, bought it, and now they’re playing it. If you look at Asmongold’s most-viewed video about all of this, it has around one million views. One million sounds like a lot! But this game will probably be bought by north of ten million people. So it’s a fraction. And even then, a lot of the people who watched that video were probably never going to buy the game anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s not negligible, exactly, but it’s still a niche. But as these things continue to have relatively convenient onramps – like searching “<em>Dragon Age</em>” on YouTube and getting pulled down this rabbit hole – do we reach a point where this is the predominant mode of conversation around games? Inmates taking over the asylum or whatever; is that where we’re headed? Because we’ve seen this in American politics: The more you enable these people structurally or systematically, the more footing they gain until they become a default.&nbsp;</p><p>Are we looking at that in the conversation around games, too? Are we already a large part of the way there? And then to what extent are the people who are engaging with this stuff and dunking on these people constantly also facilitating it? I don’t know. I hate to use this phrase, but I’m just asking questions. It’s one of those things that… I wouldn’t say it keeps me up at night, but when I can’t sleep, I’m like “I may as well also make myself feel bad.” And so I start thinking about things like this.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I want to say that it’s still a small number of people broadly. And I was talking to someone else this week about how we see the internet, but there are also millions of people playing video games who are not on the internet. So what are people actually doing? To some extent, you’ll never know. And I want to say that at least on Twitter, it’s an echo chamber. But I don’t know. This conspiracy about Sweet Baby, is it this widespread conspiracy, or is it three loud guys and their friends? I think seeing this colloquial usage of it <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dualshockers-promotes-idiotic-alt-right-sweet-baby-conspiracy-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-hastily-deletes.1021527/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this DualShockers review</a> makes me think “Oh God, maybe it’s a bigger thing.” Who just says that?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I think an important thing to remember is, we work in video games, and we work directly with people who know as much about video games as possible and as much about the video game media ecosystem as possible. The people who follow us on social media, all they do is talk about video games all day. Our peers and colleagues and former colleagues, that’s all we talk about. As a sample of the game-playing public, we are a tiny fraction of people. All my IRL friends will talk to me about a <em>Call of Duty</em> game once a year. Everyone I play football with will talk to me about <em>EA Sports FC</em> once or twice a year to complain about it. They don’t play <em>Dragon Age</em>. They don’t know what it is. They barely know what <em>Fortnite </em>is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same for everything: It’s music. It’s movies. People don’t consume media about these things constantly on a daily basis. It’s easy for us to lose track of that because we think everybody does, because everybody around us does. But my experience with this stuff – because I make it my point to know as many people outside of games as possible to avoid becoming a broken husk of a person – is [that] it’s really important to get that perspective. It’s fucking video games. No one cares. Play a game you like or don’t. You don’t need to go online and talk about it for 18 hours a day or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, people like Asmongold are out there making these videos, but like Nathan said, what’s a video like that going to top out at? A million? Worldwide? Among English-speaking people? That’s not shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right. There are well over 300 million people in the United States alone.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Right, and that doesn’t include English-speaking people in Europe and the rest of the Anglosphere. I don’t think it’s something to be worried about as a discourse-shaping trend; it’s more just a bummer for that type of content on that type of medium. It’s gonna go on its own journey, and during that time people are going to be put off it. People might stop watching that kind of content and look somewhere else. They might look on TikTok or on blogs like Aftermath dot site. </p><p>It’s not a given that every 13 year-old boy watching an Asmongold video is going to turn into someone who thinks like that.&nbsp;Most people are relatively normal, and there’s a point where once people with a certain kind of hateful or twisted or conspiratorial view start to get oxygen and start to get enabled, their views become increasingly bizarre to a normal person. People aren’t so easily brainwashed that they’ll all just go along with that. </p><p>Obviously the political situation in the United States shows that lots of people can if they’re subjected to it long and hard enough, but on a global basis, on a normal-person basis, a lot of people will eventually be like “I think this guy’s fucking weird” or “Who cares? It’s <em>Dragon Age</em>” or “Not everything has to be a conspiracy and a political gesture.” I’m more optimistic than other people are with that stuff, but it’s more of a YouTube problem than a societal problem. They need to sort that out.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>True, but in addition it’s a Twitter problem, it’s a Facebook problem, with Asmongold there it’s a Twitch problem, it is to some extent a TikTok problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> But Facebook is a great example because kids don’t use Facebook anymore. It’s boomer shit, and it’s full of weirdos, so they stopped using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> But it’s a radicalization engine for boomers. All of these things are radicalization engines. They all ended up at the same place despite starting at different starting points. If we’re just talking on radicalization engines – those are our main means of communication – then how long until everyone is some flavor of radicalized, and not for the better? And again, you talk about polarized politics in our country; we’re already part of the way there. I hope that things get better, but I think that will require a concerted effort on the part of those who want them to be better to build something else. I think as long as we’re doing it all [on these platforms], there will be a slow but steady downward trend.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Arcade1Up has released plenty of Pac-Man arcade cabinets over the years, but the newest full-size addition to its catalog might be the coolest yet.

Due to Arcade1Up labeling this particular Pac-Man cabinet a "limited edition," it would appear that once Amazon sells out, Pac-Man Plus will be gone for good.</p><p>If you don't have room for the Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet or want a more affordable way to play Pac-Man, Arcade1Up just released a new <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga Countercade</a></strong>.

This is the third patch to arrive since last weekend’s release and adds a host of tweaks and fixes for glitches big and small. Although the update largely focuses on Multiplayer and Zombies, it also includes a trio of universal touch-ups, including the removal of that pesky black screen glitch that has bothered players when trying to load into a match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/codblops6-1725926226920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update brings fixes for Multiplayer and Zombies.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Multiplayer adjustments include the removal of Lowtown from the Infected map pool while adding the same mode to Private Match’s list of available modes. Players will now find that the Shotgun Slug attachment deals the correct amount of damage, too. Stability improvements have also arrived to address hiccups revolving around the UAV Scorestreak, Infected medals, and the Vigilance Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s typical for some players to take advantage of map exploits shortly after launch, and it’s also typical for the team at Activision to move quickly when squashing these exploits. Today’s update is no different, as it comes with a few patched exploits in the Zombies mode. Specifically, enjoyers of the round-based game mode will no longer be able to re-activate timed GobbleGums for extra use. Additionally, the Tactical Raft can no longer be used to block zombie paths on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 launched last Friday and has already positioned itself as one of the most successful Call of Duty games of all time. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>the series’ biggest launch ever</u></a> earlier this week.

The patch also resolves an issue that allowed players to utilize Tactical Raft to block zombies.

In the time since, consoles and PCs alike have progressed even further, giving developers more power than ever to work with. As such, Sony has opted to revisit this hit game to bring its presentation more in line with its sequel, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, with a killer remaster that packs in a whole lot of improvements. Here’s what you need to know about <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>.</p><h2 id="h104231"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s new in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was already a stunning game on PlayStation 4, and the 60fps update it received a while back for PlayStation 5 left a lot of folks questioning if it even needed a remaster. Well, however you felt about that, a quick glance at the many improvements makes it easy to appreciate this lovingly-crafted upgrade.</p><p>So what’s new? Here’s a breakdown of the most notable changes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The overall visuals have been drastically improved, with better textures, increased foliage density, and reworked lighting</li><li>There are more than 10 hours of re-recorded dialogue and motion capture that make characters appear considerably less stiff in cutscenes, looking far more fluid like those in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li><li>DualSense support is now available, offering haptic feedback and adaptive trigger functionality</li><li>You can now fully remap your controls</li><li>A wide variety of new accessibility features can be toggled on and off</li><li>Remixed audio that takes advantage of Dolby Atmos and PlayStation’s Tempest 3D AudioTech</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Since <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> is the same game as the original, returning players should have a pretty good idea of its length and content. If you’re new to the game, though, you may be curious how long it’ll take to complete.</p><p>An average playthrough of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> should take you around <strong>20 to 25 hours</strong>. This includes casually dabbling in a few side activities but mostly focusing on the main story. Of course, the remaster also includes the game’s only DLC, <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, which can take another 10 to 15 hours to experience.</p><p>However, those seeking to see and do everything the main game and DLC has to offer can spend up to <strong>80 hours</strong> exploring its stunning landscapes, to clear all the bandit camps, climb all of the Longnecks, and finish a wide variety of other optional but rewarding tasks—doing that ultimately results in earning its coveted Platinum trophy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was originally developed by Guerrilla Games, the same team that brought to life PlayStation’s long-running <em>Killzone</em> franchise. They have since focused on releasing more games in the series, including <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, and the upcoming <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> was remastered by Nixxes, who are best known for porting or remastering other popular PlayStation exclusives, like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>. They’ve got a firm grip on this process, and it shows in this beautifully upgraded version of a game that was already gorgeous on PlayStation 4.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> is available on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p>Since the game is published by Sony, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never release on Xbox or Nintendo consoles.

<p>Prime Gaming is a sweet deal for anyone already subscribed to Amazon Prime. It’s arguably one of the best aspects of the service for a gamer, as the platform offers up stacks of free games every month for you to download across a range of platforms. It’s a shame that the games are almost always exclusive to PC players but never mind.</p>



<p>Amazon has revealed a hefty assortment of games coming to the platform <strong>for free </strong>in November – check out the full list below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-free-game-on-prime-gaming-in-november">Every Free Game on Prime Gaming in November</h2>



<p>There are some seriously tantalising titles coming to Prime Gaming through November.</p>



<p>As usual, the release of these games will be staggered, and to pick up a certain game you’ve got your eye on, you might still need to wait a few weeks before it’s available. Also, you’ll need to be willing to use a series of platforms and storefronts to redeem the games – GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games, for instance.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Prime Gaming games in November:</p>



<p><strong>November 1 – Available Now</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy (Epic)</li>



<li>Mafia: Definitive Edition (GOG)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>November 7</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dishonored – Definitive Edition (GOG)</li>



<li>Duck Paradox (GOG)</li>



<li>Close to the Sun (GOG)</li>



<li>Disney Pixar’s Cars (Amazon)</li>



<li>Bang Bang Racing (Amazon)</li>



<li>Snakebird Complete (Epic)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>November 14</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Max: The Curse of the Brotherhood (Amazon)</li>



<li>Overcooked: Gourmet Edition (GOG)</li>



<li>Gloomy Tales: One Way Ticket Collector’s Edition (Legacy Code)</li>



<li>Super Meat Boy (Epic)</li>



<li>Moonscars (GOG)</li>



<li>Riot – Civil Unrest (GOG)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>November 27</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Elite Dangerous (Epic)</li>



<li>Sir Whoopass – Immortal Death (GOG)</li>



<li>Jurassic World Evolution (Epic)</li>



<li>Mystery Case Files: The Dalimar Legacy Collector’s Edition (Amazon)</li>



<li>Shogun Showdown (GOG)</li>
</ul>



<p>Which games are you most looking forward to from that list?</p>

<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is here and players are <strong>pouring </strong>onto the platform, soaking up every ounce of the free-to-play trial. On Steam, a whopping 463,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying Capcom’s upcoming title, putting it in the platform’s top four games by player count in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>It’s storming up the charts on other platforms, too. The launch of the Monster Hunter Wilds beta has even dwarfed the likes of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which was released just yesterday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-numbers-running-wild">Numbers Running Wild</h2>



<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is great, but it’s not running well on PC. Players have reported widespread issues, including an unpredictable frame rate and a bizarre problem that’s turning enemies into polygonal nightmares.</p>



<p>Many have written the game off because of the somewhat exorbitant system requirements, so that might go some way to explaining the issues. However, Capcom has assured users that it’s acting on all the feedback received during the beta, and the base game is ‘already better’ because of it.</p>



<p>The team has been quick to address the biggest issues through support functions on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you’re experiencing issues in the Steam version of the Open Beta Test, please check out our Troubleshooting &amp; Known Issues guide: <a href="https://t.co/KNr7t4ECRS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bit.ly/OBTsupport</a>.</p>



<p>The issue of afterimage noise occurring in certain environments when Frame Generation is enabled will be fixed in the full game, which is already in a more improved state compared to the beta test.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the support options are pretty thin, directing players to generic troubleshooting articles that offer advice that’s not at all tailored to the game or any specific problems. </p>



<p>Despite the technical issues, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta continues to perform well, numbers-wise. At the time of writing, 144,000 players were logged into the game on Steam alone, and on Twitch, it’s beating Counter-Strike, Escape from Tarkov, and Apex Legends.</p>

                <p>Activision has released the latest in its "Replacer" line of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 ads, and this one is maybe the best and funniest yet. If you're just catching up, Peter Stormare plays a character called The Replacer; he's the guy who replaces you because you're too busy playing Call of Duty.</p><p>In this newest spot, The Replacer fills in for Tonya on Jeopardy, before having a hilarious exchange with Jeopardy host Ken Jennings that culminates in The Replacer replacing Jennings. It's good stuff, riffing on Saturday Night Live's popular series of Jeopardy spoofs with a contestant messing with the host.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORamyqb1G0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gORamyqb1G0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Activision has created more than two dozen of these Replacer ads for Black Ops 6, featuring Stormare replacing all manner of people, including TV hosts, the Pope, the NFL's Kyler Murray, boxer Canelo Alvarez, podcast host Joe Rogan, and political analysts. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see all the spots on the Call of Duty YouTube page.</a></p><p>Stormare's The Replacer debuted in 2013 and has been a mainstay for Activision's Black Ops marketing campaigns over the years.

It remains to be seen if that will happen, however.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-spiked-call-of-duty-to-a-bonkers-day-on-xbox/1100-6527515/" data-ref-id="1100-6527515">quick success</a>.

Presumably, travel would be slow, costly, and strategic. It no doubt would have introduced new alien enemy types as well, potentially introducing some interesting sci-fi mysteries about the origins of human and Locust life on Sera.</p><p>The industry veteran suggested those ideas, which didn’t sound like anything more than a pitch document at the time, were scrapped as The Coalition works instead on mining Gears’ past with a prequel centered around Emergence Day, the franchise’s version of the Invasion of Normandy when millions of Locust came out of holes in the ground to attack humanity, eventually leading to the use of weapons of mass destruction that ended up crippling Sera’s surface-dwelling nations.</p><p><em>Gears 5</em> also ended with a cliffhanger related to a choice about which main character to rescue, the consequences of which would seemingly get hashed out in<em> Gears 6</em>. It sounded like the plan was for the most popular choice among players to become the canonical one. Though, at the rate the franchise is going, it could be years before fans get to see that play out in a game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be in our hands and on our consoles and other assorted platforms in little more than a month. It was over a year ago that Bethesda Game Studios lifted the lid on Indy’s next adventure – and subsequently revealed that the iconic adventurer would be played by none other than Troy Baker.</p>



<p>However, in the months leading up to the production of the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard was against signing the superstar actor for the lead role.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-people-chose-you-every-time">‘People Chose You Every Time’</h2>



<p>Troy Baker is one of the most storied voice actors in the industry. From BioShock to Shadow of Mordor, and from The Last of Us to inFamous, he has been around the block more than a few times.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chat with Troy Baker</a> recently about a new cyberpunk-themed project he worked on.</p>



<p>It seemed like an obvious choice to pair Baker with Jones, as almost anything the actor touches turns to gold. But Todd Howard, one of Bethesda Game Studios’ most senior heads, originally rejected the idea of hiring Baker.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Rolling Stone</a>, Todd Howard and Troy Baker were captured offering their thoughts on the same page. It was revealed that the pair hadn’t properly met before they touched base regarding the role of Indiana Jones. It was stated that Howard outrightly told Troy over a video call that he ‘wasn’t what they wanted’.</p>



<p>This was despite audiences reacting positively to Baker’s performances:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>‘We felt for this project and the time period it was set in, we cast a pretty wide net,’ </em>Howard says. <em>‘I’ll have you know, we did a blind taste test, and people chose you every time.’</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the team – and Todd Howard – opted to bring in Troy Baker to perform the role of the legendary treasure hunter. </p>



<p>Do you think they made the right decision? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Now, I know many people will think 70,000 isn’t all that impressive, as it doesn’t break the top ten most-played games on Steam, but it did surpass <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for a time, which is no small feat.
