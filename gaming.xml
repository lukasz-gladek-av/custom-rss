<p>According to Insider Gaming, anonymous sources say the title was cancelled within the "last couple of weeks", but there's no specific reason provided. The same outlet has reached out to Arc System Works for comment, but hasn't heard back.</p>
<p>One source added how the new project was effectively "back to the drawing board" for the franchise and its future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ugnspl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Arc System Works most recently revealed <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel T≈çkon: Fighting Souls</a></strong> - a new 4v4 fighting game which is backed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and will be releasing on the PlayStation 5 and PC next year. So, most of the focus is likely going to be on this game in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This rumour follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> on the Nintendo Switch at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, this particular platform is still waiting on DLC. Producer Ken Miyauchi has <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/big-plans-teased-for-guilty-gear-strive-after-season-4-and-cyberpunk-edgerunners-lucy">also recently teased "big" plans</a> for the current game's future, with the fourth season of DLC scheduled to add Lucy.</p>

The storyline takes weird tangents, henchmen hanging around in the background and chat, and your selection of talking weapons never shut up. One of them - my favorite, whose ammunition is the bodies of his newborn children - is even voiced by comedian Tim Robinson from I Think You Should Leave and A24's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/friendship">Friendship</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He'll say  typical line from Knifey might be "I'm in heaven right now, I'm ripping through his tendons like they're butter," or a dying Carebear type creature with its intestines hanging out will beg you to stay until it dies, then fake you out until Kenny begs you to shoot him. NPCs chat about killing their wives and kids so they won't miss them, or who  on the team might be into sexual torture. There's a section in an Applebees, a gun called Lezduit who talks like Sylvester Stallone, a kid who taunts you to kill him - "I look so shootable" while Kenny begs you not to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, just try it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> was just announced this summer and is supposed to be out by this winter, so you'll want to catch up with the story before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

This unfamiliar language is the Aeonian people's mother tongue, and during the early stages of being on their planet, you won't have any idea what they're saying. Your new friend Lodi has a basic understanding of their language, but there are location-specific abilities that you can unlock in order to further bond with them as well as open these chests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532623" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532623"></a><figcaption>A locked chest needing the Rosetta upgraded.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png"></figure><p>As you progress through The Edge of Fate's campaign missions, you'll be asked to <strong>meet with the Dean, Rebecca</strong>.

The port will launch on July 17, but this early footage may be running the 2.3 update already, because fans have taken note of what might be an autopilot icon when V gets behind the wheel. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>had a similar function when you rode your horse, allowing you to trot along to your destination without having to move your character yourself. If <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> got a similar feature, it would actually be a genuine improvement to the game because its cars handle like they‚Äôre hydroplaning. Motorcycles run well enough, though. However, sometimes the plot requires you to drive a car for races and high-speed chases, and that shit <em>sucked</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that pre-orders are live for their latest starter set. The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is their largest set to date, packed with everything a new play group needs. It is also their priciest.</p>



<p>In the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set, players will get everything they need to start playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> right out of the box. This includes physical maps, class boards, monster cards and spell cards for quick referencing, NPC cards for the DM, tokens, and dice. This is the first starter set featuring the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a> ruleset.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-the-borderlands-box-contents.jpg?itok=AhzRUgkc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-the-borderlands-box-contents.jpg?itok=nfC1xg8Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, the set will include guides to help players come to grips with other aspects of the game. This includes creating memorable characters, navigating D&amp;D's various settings, progressing through epic quests, fighting monsters, and more. Lastly, the set contains three booklets. Each booklet will contain a quick, hour-long adventure. No prior experience needed.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is an update on one of the oldest, most enduring modules in the game's history. It is based on <em>The Keep on the Borderlands</em>, written by Gary Gygax and published in 1979. It was also designed to introduce new players to the game, packed full of rules and sage advice.</p>

<p>This adventure has a special place in the game's history. It has been reprinted several times throughout various editions of the game. It's even been reprinted by OSR-focused developer Goodman Games under the title <em>Into The Borderlands</em>, which contained scans of the original adventure, a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, and testimonials from various designers and players.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is the most expensive starter set to date. On D&amp;D Beyond, a physical copy of the set is $49.99. A digital copy on the platform is $14.99. And there is the Ultimate bundle, which gives you access to both at $54.99. The starter set will release September 16.</p>

I then realized that I had likely done the same a few months ago, probably under some frantic attempt to make room on my ever-overflowing storage devices, during which I thought, ‚ÄúWhen the hell am I gonna sift through hours of <em>Starfield</em> footage?‚Äù But after learning the only other copies of these videos were trashed, and realizing I completely misplaced and lost the game‚Äôs photo mode folder, a rather strange quote sprang to mind from Bethesda‚Äôs managing director, Ashley Cheng, addressing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-steam-reviews-bethesda-1851052929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-steam-reviews-bethesda-1851052929">early concerns that <em>Starfield</em></a></span> was bland:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>‚ÄúWhen the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there.

Hell, in the vast travels I took across the states, Canada, and a sliver of the UK in my 20s, I took tons of videos and photos that I haven‚Äôt looked at in many years, but I‚Äôd be really upset if I found they were just suddenly <em>gone</em>. In fact, I still think about things I saw that I regret not taking a picture of nearly a decade later.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>It all brings to mind so much of the work Bethesda and Microsoft were doing in telling us this game was something special, instead of ever really showing it to us in the form of a compelling game.

There are many video games that capture this spirit of stillness, of just being in awe of a visual spectacle that communicates a sense of place. But <em>Starfield</em>‚Äôs overabundance has failed to be one of them. Despite some fleetingly beautiful moments across its many worlds, not a single one of them felt precious enough for me to feel bad about losing the archival footage.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-falling-asleep-to-let%E2%80%99s-plays-medically-approved-gamer-melatonin-or-nah.1244448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For about seven years now, the only way I‚Äôve been able to lull myself to sleep is by watching YouTube Let‚Äôs Plays. This isn‚Äôt a jab at YouTube gamers being boring. As a kid, I would routinely fall asleep to the smooth voice of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpovAmh0blw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA commentator Michael Breen</a>, and this is a similar vibe. It‚Äôs comfy shit.&nbsp;</p><p>I‚Äôm not the only person who uses this very millennial sleep method. There are countless YouTube channels with thousands of subscribers who make content to fall asleep to. And there are plenty of Reddit threads asking for content creators with a chill vibe and a comforting voice, or if there are good playlists to fall asleep to.</p><p>However, there‚Äôs always been this nagging question in my mind over whether my self-made, undiagnosed insomnia remedy is just new-age snake oil or if there‚Äôs some actual medical benefit to falling asleep to video game commentary. So I decided to ask a sleep expert about it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ghost in the Shell<span></span><span>Production I.G</span></figcaption></figure><p>A week ago, I sent out a broad message to neurologists in Chicago. Neurologists are medical professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating disorders of the nervous system. A key part of their work involves brain activity and sleep. After reaching out across the Chicagoland area, I connected with <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/kenneth-lee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenneth Lee</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago and the medical and clinical director at the University of Chicago Sleep Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee was quite excited to talk with me because he is a gamer himself. Among his colleagues at UIC, Northwestern, and Loyola, he‚Äôs the only gaming professional in the field. (Nice). He provided his gamer credentials, saying that he‚Äôs been a gamer his entire life, owns a gaming PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and mainly plays a lot of <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors</em>, and <em>Skate 3</em>, along with RPGs like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> whenever he isn‚Äôt playing <em>Mario Kart</em> <em>World</em> with his boys. In short, I wasn‚Äôt speaking gibberish when I asked him about Let‚Äôs Plays to fall asleep to from a medical standpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a career where patients of all age groups approach him with questions about sleep problems, Lee told me that falling asleep to Let‚Äôs Plays isn‚Äôt new territory for him.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt is a phenomenon that we have noticed. It's not exclusive to just Let's Plays. We oftentimes see this just with people being in bed on TikTok. And then, in the older populations, it's like needing the TV on to go to sleep,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúLet's Plays is almost kind of an extension of that behavior in the past. I see that as the Gen Z version, so to speak. But I think that the premise is very similar to what a lot of people have done throughout the ages.‚Äù</p><figure><figcaption>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door<span></span><span>Bones</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Lee admits it's hard to measure, sleep studies haven‚Äôt previously determined how many people identify with the Let's Play community for sleep. He notes that a significant number use ‚Äúsome sort of device‚Äù as a distraction or noise to help them fall asleep. Lee estimates this accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of the population. However, as the saying goes, just because many people do something doesn‚Äôt mean it's beneficial. Regarding whether Let‚Äôs Plays help or hinder the process of falling asleep, from a neurological perspective, the answer varies. But Lee did explain the medical science behind what this process has done for people like me as a solution to insomnia.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWhat it really does is that [Let‚Äôs Plays] kind of help relax the brain,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúIt's kind of like your winding down process, essentially, in terms of just kind of your relaxation state.‚Äù</p><p>In neurology, Lee says he and his colleagues emphasize to their patients struggling with insomnia that having a routine is important. One suggestion is to set aside a worry time before you go to sleep‚Äîmaybe two to three hours beforehand, during which you take stock of or inventory the things you need to do or what's worrying you. That way, when the time comes to greet Mr. Sandman, you can dedicate the last hour of worry time to relaxing. Or, in anime speak, Nazuna Nanakuza in <em>Call of the Night</em> saying, ‚ÄúStay up until you feel satisfied about your day.‚Äù</p><figure><figcaption>Call of the Night <span></span><span>Lidenfilms</span></figcaption></figure><p>‚ÄúThese Let's Plays and so forth, really can be an extension of that‚Äî[doing] this kind of routine,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúThe other thing that it does is it gives you something to focus on, to some extent, which can also help relax things, focus in terms of shutting things down.‚Äù</p><p>Another aspect of falling asleep to Let‚Äôs Plays, which Lee mentioned as a tip for people seeking a good routine, is practicing what‚Äôs called sleep hygiene. This essentially means ensuring your environment is as conducive to sleep as possible, such as by making sure your bed is optimized for you to fall asleep.</p><figure><figcaption>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End<span></span><span>Madhouse </span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking anecdotally, my sleeping environment over the past decade has involved cozying up on my Casper mattress and memory foam pillow, putting on my Bose headphones, queueing up hours-long Let‚Äôs Plays, and drifting off. A problem with this, however, is that it isn‚Äôt good sleep hygiene, because I‚Äôm trying to fall asleep to a screen emitting bright light. Lee said he recommends patients try to avoid screens. Although he concedes that his refrain is a boilerplate medical statement, he does acknowledge that for some people, allotting some screen light in their sleep routine can be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, I would turn to YouTube playlists from creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGQkbwm0yHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Best Friends Play</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-QgmqAlQTgwWi5Jr3sB0d6oRcgWjNaLU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapcube‚Äôs Real-Time Fan Dub</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Four Star‚Äôs Dragon Ball Z Abridged Series</a> to listen to and fall asleep, I encountered the screen issue Lee mentioned when trying to reset my circadian rhythm: all the flashing lights would wake me up. It wasn‚Äôt until I grew tired of modifying familiar comfort playlists by keeping my laptop lid almost closed or flipping over my dimmed phone and started exploring videos specifically made for sleep that I saw a noticeable difference in my sleep quality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oneyplays Fall Asleep to Zach (Part 16) [Fan Edit]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PikjT7IJ2qc?start=14434&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of the channels I frequent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SleepyTimeEdits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SleepyTime Edits</a>, which posts <a href="https://youtu.be/PikjT7IJ2qc?si=b1iRjJit3RbruHWr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos of 10+ hours of Oneyplays</a>, sets its videos to a dim, still image, creating a calmer visual ambiance. This transforms video game compilations into a podcast-like experience, as well as providing me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGoLnyMHnD4&amp;t=664s&amp;pp=ygUac21pbGluZyBmcmllbmRzIGFkdWx0IHN3aW0%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Smiling Friends</em></a>-adjacent content to laugh myself to sleep to.&nbsp;</p><p>In describing SleepyTime Edits‚Äô makeshift solution to Lee‚Äîasking whether this kind of media engagement supported or interfered with the brain‚Äôs transition into sleep‚Äîhe said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúa bit of a double-edged sword.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúSay that you're watching a Let's Play that is super intense, like an EVO event or something that you're really into, that's not the best thing that's going to help you quiet your brain. If it's more relaxing, that can calm your mind down. Even if it's something you‚Äôve seen, like a Let's Play that [you‚Äôve] watched before,‚Äù Lee said.</p><figure><figcaption>Neon Genesis Evangelion<span></span><span>Gainax</span></figcaption></figure><p>He continued, ‚ÄúYou do have to be careful about things such as light. I recommend to my patients that you use a dimmer setting‚Äî a lot of devices now have blue light settings. But really, I also recommend a light setting itself, because a lot of bright light can interfere with your sleep onset, and dim lights as well. It really varies. But it can be paradoxical in that it can be relaxing, but it can also be activating, too.‚Äù</p><p>Regarding whether there are any medically recognized videos to help with insomnia, Lee mentioned a treatment he and his colleagues use called <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/psychiatry-and-psychology/cognitive-behavioral-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CBT for Insomnia" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYnudJrod8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>‚ÄúThe way I like to think of this is retraining your brain how to sleep. What happens with more chronic insomnia‚Äîinsomnia that's been there for several months‚Äîis that your brain loses the ability of how to sleep,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúWhat [cognitive behavioral therapy] does is help guide you with meditation techniques&nbsp; [and], a lot of times, things that can help, like white noise.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Lee said that much of the CBT video content is easily accessible on YouTube, featuring videos that demonstrate breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques to help calm the mind and promote sleep. This can be especially helpful when finances are tight and people can‚Äôt afford a sleep prescription from a doctor or sleep expert. One point Lee emphasized was the University of Chicago business center's insomnia treatment, <a href="https://www.drlullaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DrLullaby</a>. During this virtual session, patients, guided by a sleep-trained clinical psychologist, work together to find ways to improve their nighttime sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Lee acknowledged that using Let‚Äôs Plays to sleep shares a similar functional approach to cognitive behavioral therapy as a layman‚Äôs solution to insomnia-focused sleep medicine, he also issued a warning for individuals who find it helpful in falling asleep or relaxing.</p><p>‚ÄúDuring the nighttime, things like noises, even though they‚Äôre low-lights and so forth, something flashing can actually disrupt your sleep,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúTry to recognize that as well, and try to limit the stimuli that‚Äôs around you.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Game Grumps MEGA COMPILATION !!! 8+ HOURS - Sleep Aid - Best of 2021" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS1tzv_rJYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which naturally leads into the next reason not to fall asleep to Let‚Äôs Plays: random loud noises. When I first reached out to Lee to start that conversation and sighed with relief at my mention of the Game Grumps not making him burst into dust, he noted that LPers you find comfort listening to, while adding to the soothing process of falling asleep, can just as easily break your rhythm if they‚Äôre prone to having a shouting match in the middle of playing.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúEverybody's a little bit different. Some people are going to be more susceptible when you're watching a Game Grumps Let's Play if somebody yells or shouts out something,‚Äù Lee said, adding that folks do run that risk of having their sleep cycle interrupted.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to whether Lee considers Let‚Äôs Plays a medically sound way to fall asleep or a workaround with its own risks, he says he‚Äôs somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt can be helpful if that's part of your routine to relax and help make it so that you know your mind and your body are in a place that can easily fall asleep. I think that it can be helpful,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúI don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest specifically Let's Plays and so forth, or any studies, which would be an interesting area to explore.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThat being said, [Let‚Äôs Plays] can also backfire on you so you have to be cautious with that. It could backfire for a single night, where, say, you have a Game Grumps Let's Play and then they start screaming [and] that wakes you up, and now you have trouble falling back asleep. And then it could potentially develop into more of a chronic insomnia, where it helps you kind of acutely, but then, over time, because of those things, you're actually developing more problems. That's where it is a little bit of a double-edged sword, and you do have to be cautious taking a stock of your own individualized approach to it.‚Äù</p><figure><figcaption>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners <span></span><span>Trigger </span></figcaption></figure><p>I, ever the rebel, have ignored the warning signs because they've also led to a fun result in my sleep, where whatever Dan and Arin are babbling about ends up influencing my dreams. This creates a pretty fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BdhmLanXjU&amp;pp=ygUpZ2FtZSBncnVtcHMgdG8gZmFsbCBhc2xlZXAgdG8gcGFwZXIgbWFyaW8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery box </a>phenomenon every night, where I look forward to seeing how these videos influence my otherwise dreamless sleep. When asked whether there is an explanation for how sleeping with Let‚Äôs Play channels ends up scripting my dreams, Lee says medical science has yet to fully explain that phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúI wish we knew more about that or why that happens, but there's so much about the subconscious that we just don't know. As you're going into transition sleep, or even just when you're going into sleep, your brain is not shut off to what's around you. If you think about just kind of why we have that evolutionarily, if there's a threat, you wake up. So you're still absorbing things, you're just not recognizing it. How the subconscious kind of interprets that into dreams, that's a great question. And one I don't really have an answer for, but it has been explored throughout the ages,‚Äù he said.&nbsp;</p><p>While Lee couldn‚Äôt provide an explanation for why Let‚Äôs Plays might influence sleep or if they are similar to brain dances in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, he did give a polite send-off to people like myself who use Let‚Äôs Plays to fall asleep. It‚Äôs the most courteous way a medical professional can suggest to a gamer to touch grass while counting virtual sheep.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIf you are using Let‚Äôs Plays, we recommend that the bed should only be used for sleep and intimacy,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúSo trying to do those things outside of bed and then, when you're feeling tired, going to bed, is the best approach.‚Äù</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi‚Äôs Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‚ÄòUma Musume‚Äô Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We‚Äôve conditioned ourselves to believe that we‚Äôre all one big happy family"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Xbox developer Rare, which today is best known for Sea of Thieves, has commented on the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft that led to the cancellation of the studio's long-in-development project Everwild.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCzbo9xxo4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves developer update video for July</a>, Rare production director Drew Stevens started off by addressing the layoffs. "It would be strange to jump straight into our usual updates without acknowledging the news that we've ended development on Everwild here at Rare," Stevens said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/another-xbox-studio-reacts-to-the-layoffs-exploding-around-it-with-rares-everwild-dead-sea-of-thieves-dev-says-its-impossible-for-something-like-this-not-to-ripple-through-the-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>The game was formally revealed all the way back in November 2019, but beyond a trailer for it in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-was-missing-all-these-major-games/2900-6657/">updates on it have been almost non-existent</a>. Sources said Rare was unable to find the right direction for Everwild, and now it's no longer in development.</p><p>The cancellation of Everwild didn't "directly impact" Sea of Thieves, Stevens added, mentioning that development is continuing as planned. "Our focus as a team and a studio is on supporting our friends and colleagues whose roles are at risk," Stevens said.</p><p>The developer went on to say that it's "impossible for something like this not to ripple through the studio and affect all of us in some way or another, so please bear with us."</p><p>"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's reached out to check in on us and share their kind words of support. Genuinely, thank you, it really means a lot," Stevens said.</p><p>It wasn't just Everwild that got canned as part of the Xbox cutbacks, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">also canceled</a> a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, as well as the new Perfect Dark. Microsoft also laid off numerous developers across its network of studios.</p><p>The cuts came as part of a wider downsizing effort at Microsoft that affected more than 9,000 people and against the backdrop of Microsoft investing billions into artificial intelligence projects. Some of the laid-off developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King say <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they are set to be replaced by AI systems they helped create.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion from Bungie for Destiny 2 and the first major expansion to kick off a new era of Destiny, the Fate Saga, is out now on all platforms. </p>



<p>The Edge of Fate sees the Guardians getting some help from a new ally, Lodi, as the story centers once again on the Nine, and sees the Guardians dealing with a threat to the universe that goes back even before the Traveler came into the picture. Set in a new location, Kepler, there's plenty of mystery and changes to Destiny 2 coming in this update.</p>



<p>Edge of Fate introduces an overhaul to the armor system with Armor 3.0, a new UI system that's supposed to streamline the experience for players. It also marks the removal of the paywall for seasonal content, and the addition of a new permanent shooting range. </p>



<p>While the expansion is out today for players to check out, the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, will launch this weekend on July 19, 2025.</p>

<p>It's been no secret that Bungie has been struggling recently. While this new expansion offers a chance for the studio to experience a bright spot in their calendar this year, the delay for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal around it</a>, and reports of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">studio's internal troubles all pointing to leadership;</a> it's clear that the studio desperately needs a win. If only for those developers who have been working overtime to fix the mistakes of their bosses. </p>



<p>Hopefully, Edge of Fate is the beginning of Bungie taking a turn for the better. It's the sign of a healthy industry when a storied studio like Bungie can grow in strength over its many years, instead of dwindling into what many long-time fans fear to be the inevitable, that the studio shuts its doors for good within a few years time.</p>
