<p>Metal Eden is a sci-fi FPS title where you get to explore a world where humanity's consciousness is no longer being held in captivity in the flesh and now resides within robots. There will be eight missions for you to make your way through, with a handcrafted universe to explore. This game will see you plunged into an artificial world full of cybernetic warfare, where you'll be given the opportunity to take control of a hyper unit while also exploring the world and uncovering the mysteries of the futuristic world before you.</p>
<p>In Metal Eden, you take on the role of ASKA, which is an advanced Hyper Unit android that has been built around a digitized human psyche. The architecture in the world around you is bathed in neon lights, helping to immerse you into the cyber-futuristic world in front of you, which has been named Moebius. As you explore Moebius, you will find yourself participating in the ongoing conflict over the souls of a lost human colony that are stored in cybernetic COREs.</p>
<p>On this journey, you are accompanied by your sentient spaceship named Nexus. As you progress through the story, you will expand and upgrade your arsenal, as well as make your robotic body even stronger and more robust to be able to continue fighting off enemies in a mechanical world. By fighting the diverse roster of enemies, you will have to extract energy cores that will provide you with an advantage on the battlefield. Along with upgrading your weaponry, you'll also get to upgrade and obtain new combat abilities that will make you a force of nature.</p>
<p>If you like parkour in your games, you'll want to keep an eye on Metal Eden, as you are able to dash, grapple, and wall-run your way through Moebius while taking on enemies in intense encounters.</p>
<p>Metal Eden will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 6, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-reach-250k-inside-a-week.1108362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Viral indie sensation&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone within its first week on Steam, developer Cyberwave and publisher rokaplay Bou-tique have announced.</p>

<p>Since being released on February 7th (which is less than a week ago at time of writing),&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has hit 250,000 sales, which isn't bad at all for a title "developed by a solo artist from Cyberwave...as a fun side project".</p>

<p>The game's success probably won't come as a surprise if you spend any time watching content creators on Twitch and other platforms. The studios claim&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>racked up "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube shorts, and...14.5 million views on Instagram Reels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=2ULmhNzY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=w8LYrPZA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Players seem pretty enamored with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>&nbsp;on the, er, whole, too, with the game garnering a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,700 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Positive reviews highlight the game's simplicity, lack of pretension, and strong Steam Deck support, so if those are things you're looking for in your next snack-size indie game, then this could well be one for you to try out.</p>

<p>Be aware, though, that some negative reviews point to&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s short length, and for some, the very simplicity praised by its adherents is enough to put them off. Caveat emptor, as they say.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, it's probably one of the most self-descriptive games available on Steam right now. It is, in a very real sense, a game about digging a hole.</p>




<p>Bearing similarities to games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is simplicity itself: you must dig a hole. That's pretty much all there is to it!</p>

<p>As you dig, you can gather resources from the underground, using the money you get from selling them to upgrade your gear. There's also a story to discover, one that revolves around a "mysterious secret" you'll uncover as you dig deeper (literally).</p>

<p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's also set to come to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-the-pitt">Patrick Recommends: <em>The Pitt</em></h2><figure></figure><p>I'm not a medical drama person. Or, at least, I never thought of myself that way? I remember seeing endless commercials for <em>ER</em> growing up and I knew shows like <em>Grey's Anatomy</em> were incredibly popular, but I mostly wrote them off. I briefly considered watching <em>House</em> because one of the actors grew up near me, but I was not the target audience for Max's <em>The Pitt</em>, which is clearly aimed at old <em>ER</em> heads.</p><p>But...fuckin' hell, man, <em>The Pitt</em> is great. Set during a single shift in the emergency department of a Pittsburg hospital, each episode covers a single hour in that shift. <em>24</em> made a whole meal out of that concept ages go, but it was a meal where you kept getting not just seconds—but thirds and fourths and fifths. <em>The Pitt </em>uses this conceit in a highly contained environment, letting us track the ups (and many downs) of different medical cases over time. They are treated less like puzzle boxes to be solved than the natural unfolding of trying to identify and solve a problem.</p><p>The show is, often, a little on the nose about its problems with the medical system, as its main character (Dr. Robby) snappily outlines the many, many exploitations and weaknesses in the medical system. But he's also right? And the rest of the show is so good that it just ends up putting a smile on my face? The medical system does suck in the United States and there <em>are</em> heroes in those buildings, but you can praise the people doing great work while pointing out the system sucks.</p><p>Anyway, great show. My wife and I try to get the kids to bed early to watch it.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends-severance-season-2">Rob Recommends: <em>Severance</em>, Season 2</h2><figure></figure><p>Obvious? Yes. But this second season of <em>Severance </em>is doing a terrific job dealing with some of the hard parts of this kind of show: continuing to advance the story while necessarily tackling the fact that the premise is no longer quite as mysterious. Mind you, baffling things still happen with regularity! But the first season got to proceed fairly sedately while keeping us guessing about what some of the unique terminology used by the show’s twee-ly menacing megacorp Lumon really meant. Now, the white collar prisoners of the Severed Floor are far less naive about their situation, and Adam Scott’s character Mark is increasingly pulling at the show’s mysteries from both ends.</p><p>This is where lots of shows stumble, because explaining mysteries is rarely as satisfying as laying them out. Especially when resolving a mystery or a plot point means characters’ place in the story should change or vanish entirely. When this really misfires, you can end up with shows where it feels like answers are being made up on the fly while telling you that “your plot resolution is in another castle.” So far, the second season of <em>Severance </em>has felt as unsettling and alien as the first, but also like the story is picking up speed rather than applying the brakes in an attempt to prolong the ensemble’s status quo.</p><p>It helps that I don’t think explanations is what <em>Severance </em>is using to keep people watching. Rather, it remains a show where we wonder at our heroes’ and villains’ motivations, and whether the dark neurological magic used to divide characters’ psyches actually creates different people within a single body, or if it places the same person in different contexts, and what’s going to happen now that the boundaries are breaking down.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-orlando-my-political-biography">Cado Recommends: <em>Orlando, My Political Biography</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t prepared for <em>Orlando, My Political Biography. </em>When my metamour invited me over to watch this movie<em> </em>as part of their birthday celebration I thought “great, I enjoyed that Tilda Swinton movie, sounds like a fun time!” And while that movie <em>is </em>great, it’s a story where the gender transformation of the titular Orlando from man to woman is more or less fully accepted by the people that surround Orlando. The transformation is mainly used as a way to contrast the ways men and women were treated differently through this one character; even Orlando herself hardly spends more than a brief moment contemplating the magical seemingly overnight change.</p><p>These two movies differ in a lot of ways. For one, <em>Orlando, My Political Biography </em>is not an adaptation of that Virgina Woolf novel. One part documentary, one part manifesto, <em>Orlando </em>is the work of Paul B. Preciado, a trans writer and philosopher. It’s structured around 26 different trans and genderqueer people who compare their own personal journeys to the story in the Woolf novel. Each time a new person appears on film they introduce themselves and state that they are “playing the role of "Virginia Woolf’s Orlando.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each person acts out parts of the Orlando story, reciting from the novel and donning a neck ruff to mark them as “an Orlando,” while otherwise being dressed as their normal everyday selves. Each rendition is woven together with interviews of the same trans people discussing the material and political struggles they go through on a daily basis. It’s an arresting flow of poetry and politics, the personal presented in a way that captures not just the intimate and ever changing construction of the Self, but does so within the context of the material realities of having identities and bodies that are constantly under threat from society at large.</p><p>It’s been a particularly difficult year so far as a trans person in the United States. I’ve got it better than most by living in a state that affords me access to care and support with as few barriers as possible, but since the election I’ve had to have serious discussions about whether or not we might need to leave the country at a moment’s notice. In this headspace, I wasn’t sure as <em>Orlando </em>started up if I would find it all too much, the wound too fresh, the nerve too raw for me to go poking around in these kinds of discussions.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of The Party Film Sales</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the 1992 film the moment of transformation is a blip, but in <em>Orlando</em>, that moment is forever. That moment is in fact several moments, a continuum of change and reinvention, of a constantly shifting political landscape, and an ever evolving personal one. It’s also ultimately a joyful one. It can be easy to fall into despair in moments like our current one, and no one would blame you for it. But <em>Orlando</em> thankfully focuses all of the political and emotional energies of its narratives into a spearhead of hope and defiance. It reminded me that for as alienating as it can be to exist as a queer person, as a trans person, that I’m not alone. For as long as recorded history we know queer people have existed, and we will continue to exist. And while that's something that I knew intellectually, it can be so hard to really <em>feel</em> when you’re in fight or flight mode. </p><p>This movie is a beautiful philosophical yet material exploration of just <em>some</em> of the trans experiences that exist, ranging from people in their adolescence to people in the twilight of their life. It was a balm to see trans people happy, defiant, living. I wasn’t prepared for <em>Orlando, My Political Biography, </em>but I am grateful it came to me when it did.</p>

<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds-to-have-largest-sonic-racer-roster-including-sage-will-have-sega-characters-r2817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium</a>, the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds roster briefly appeared online before it was removed. The game will launch with 23 characters from the series’ history, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic </li>



<li>Knuckles</li>



<li>Tails </li>



<li>Shadow</li>

According to the <a href="https://x.com/sonicparadise/status/1889866065804665120?s=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>—again, it was removed after likely appearing early—Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will see “a ton more” drivers added to the game from across Sega’s different franchises.</p>



<p>There will also be 24 “main tracks” with 15 CrossWorlds that require Travel Rings to go to. Players will have 45 “unique original vehicles” to choose from for their races with 23 different power ups available to help you win the race.</p>







<p>A release date for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds hasn’t been announced, but when it releases, the game will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

<p>Embracer held its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Thursday, and with it came high praise from CEO Lars Wingefors for the recently released Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. As part of his <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1175-million-above-management-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prepared remarks</a> for the call, Wingefors said that the game’s launch success is a  “reminder” to the company about creating “great products”.</p>



<p>“The success of&nbsp;Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;is a reminder of our core – to bring great products to the market,” the Embracer CEO said. “High-quality teams need to have the resources and the time to execute their visions.</p>



<p>“When you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”</p>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one of the more successful titles from Embracer in recent memory. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over a million copies</a> in its first day, and, according to the publisher, is “fast approaching 2 million”.</p>



<p>Developer Warhorse Studios recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its post-launch plans</a> for the game, including free updates such as horse racing and hardcore mode. There are also three planned expansions coming to the game over the next year. Lastly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> was confirmed as coming in the near future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a “masterpiece” that was tough to “find one major fault” with.</p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” he wrote. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

<p>At its heart, <em>Avowed</em> is a game about colonization. Your protagonist in this action-RPG from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review-oh-the-places-youll-plunder/"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> </a>universe is the envoy for the Aedyran Empire, which has for years sent its occupying force to tame and control the wild and unruly islands of the Living Lands. What the Aedyrans try to spin as a civilizing effort in a naturally lawless place, the native residents of the Living Lands, by and large, see as a pillaging army stealing resources at the behest of their far-off masters.</p>
<p>As the Aedyran envoy, you've been sent to investigate and quell the Dreamscourge, a spreading plague that is poisoning the minds of people and beasts throughout the Living Lands. But the citizens you encounter there don't see you as the stock-standard brave hero chosen by providence to save them from an ongoing disaster. Instead, you're viewed first and foremost as a representative of the same occupying force that has had its metaphorical boot on their necks for years.</p>
<p>That fact alone adds a low-level hum of hatred and mistrust to practically every interaction you have in <em>Avowed</em>. Some characters will confront you with that hate right to your face, often with violence. Some will merely mutter it under their breath as they grudgingly tolerate your presence. Some show fear and/or disgust on their face even as they endeavor to play nice or desperately beg for favors.</p>
<p>Through it all, the same message rings clear as a bell: You are an outsider. You are not welcome here.</p>
<h2>Nobody likes me, everybody hates me...</h2>
<p>That underlying tone adds an uncomfortable and unfamiliar texture throughout your travels in <em>Avowed</em>. You're definitely not the trope-y paragon of virtue out to save the world from evil. But you're also not simply a renegade who can revel in choosing the "evil" option for every conversation tree. You're just a government functionary trying your best to navigate through an overwhelming and often unjust system that you don't control and didn't really ask to represent.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>You'll end up navigating the populace's inherent mistrust of you and your kind repeatedly as you talk through countless conversations (which you experience by staring straight ahead at well-voiced but stiff animatronics). That means deciding when to lean into your authoritarian reputation to impose your will and when to back off and insist you're "one of the good ones," so to speak. It also means deciding when to try to talk your way out of a situation, if possible, and when to just skip the chatter and attack.</p>

<p>The delicate balancing act is made all the more difficult by your additional role as a "godlike," touched by a mysterious divine presence at birth in ways that lead to physical deformity and a good deal of awkward gawking from much of the curious populace. Your godlike blessing (or is it a curse?) forms the root of an intertwining narrative that sees you conversing regularly with a spirit of the land.</p>
<p>Trying to decode that spirit's mystical mumbo jumbo into actionable intelligence is a key part of your effort against the Dreamscourge. Personally, though, I found these visions mostly tiresome and was always eager to get back to the realpolitik of Aedyran colonial relations.</p>
<h2>There are precious few at ease with moral ambiguities</h2>
<p>Your role as an Aedyran envoy is also complicated by Inquisitor Lödwyn, a heartless authoritarian enforcer that you learn of by reputation long before you make her acquaintance. Lödwyn and the Steel Garrote military force she works with don't share your direct chain of command, but that hardly matters to a populace that sees you both as different sides of the same oppressive coin. As the narrative advances, you have to decide just how much you're willing to confront and distance yourself from Lödwyn's brand of iron-willed order.</p>

<p>Rather than offering idealized "good" or "evil" paths, most quest and conversation lines in <em>Avowed</em> end in a more morally ambiguous place. Do you help a fellow godlike revive and potentially redeem his potentially murderous god, or do you take him to task for murdering an expedition force in the process? When you get back, do you tell the survivors of that force what happened to their compatriots or lie to spare their feelings?</p>
<p>Do you kill the smugglers that have stranded a pair of hard-on-their-luck Aedyrans in a shantytown, or do you pay them off at your own significant expense? Do you confront the Aedyran soldier who stole from a citizen or decide that you don't want to make an enemy of your ostensible allies?</p>
<p>While there's no apparent numerical morality system keeping track of your choices here, the uncertainty of whether you made the "right" choice stays with you as a player. And while the overarching story seems to play out more or less the same way regardless of your choice in most situations, there can be real and lasting impacts.</p>
<h2>Putting the action in action-RPG</h2>
<p>If you've played <em>Skyrim</em> or any of the many similar first-person epic RPGs it has inspired, you'll be more than familiar with the general gameplay pattern in <em>Avowed</em>. The game is divided into a few distinct major places, each with one large and vibrant city surrounded by vast, mostly empty areas where you can stumble on random wandering enemies and/or hidden tranches of items.</p>

<p>Players who are used to the dull reds and grim grays of many modern RPGs will have to get used to the bright blue skies and just-short-of-psychedelic pastel palettes that make the Living Lands much easier on the eyes.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Avowed</em>'s quests almost all boil down to venturing from a city to some far-off spot on the map to talk to a key person or retrieve some McGuffin-style relic. Usually, that trip involves confronting and/or avoiding one or more groups of hostile forces along the way, though sometimes it just means jumping across rooftops or ledges in some surprisingly smooth and forgiving platforming (especially for this kind of RPG).</p>
<p>The moment-to-moment battle action here is fast-paced and thrilling, with tight, responsive controls that feel like the polar opposite of the more deliberate attacks in a game like <em>Elden Ring</em>. While you can briefly pause the action to choose items or spells from an on-screen menu, these battles are primarily reflex-based positional dances of attack and counter-attack, which you can undertake just as well in either third-person or first-person.</p>
<p><em>Avowed</em> offers the standard selection of melee, ranged, and magical weapon options, as well as a handy button to instantly switch between two weapon sets mid-battle as the need arises. And the game's leveling system lets you focus on a particular combat style—I ended up with a glass cannon wizard—that you can pay to re-spec later for a change of pace.</p>

<p>You're also aided in combat by selecting up to two allies, who act as damage-sponging distractions that are particularly helpful in allowing you to flank large groups of enemies. As the game goes on, these companions also offer genuinely helpful protective or offensive combat abilities.</p>
<p>And outside of fighting, your companions are always ready to offer some welcome contextual wisecracks or pithy advice in all manner of situations. Don't get your hopes up about romancing your allies, though; it's not that kind of game.</p>

          
                  </div>

<h2>Hitting the three-skull wall</h2>
<p>While <em>Avowed</em> falls well short of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">the punishing difficulty of <em>Elden Ring</em> and its ilk</a>, the game definitely isn't afraid to let you stumble into an overwhelming force. If you stick exclusively to the relatively linear main storyline quests, you'll quickly be outclassed by large groups of powerful opponents that laugh off your relatively piddling attacks. These battles are indicated in your quest journal and an on-screen HUD with three skulls, subtly warning you that you're probably not ready for what's coming.</p>
<p>Even three-skull battles can be overcome with some combination of excellent reflexes, overuse of health- and magic-restoring items, or cheesy "kiting" strategies (e.g., luring powerful enemies through narrow passageways one by one). Still, butting your head against a particularly overwhelming three-skull battle over and over again is not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>It's often simpler (if more time-consuming) to seek out some easier side quests and/or random battles, grinding your way to the character level and gear necessary to turn a three-skull battle into a more manageable one- or two-skull affair. If you want to skip that grind (or don't want to test your reflexes as much), we recommend turning down the difficulty level before you start your adventure, as you can't do so afterward.</p>
<p>It would be easy to glance at <em>Avowed</em> and see just another all-too-familiar take on a well-trodden fantasy RPG space. But that would be a mistake. The game's zippy controls, tough but not overwhelming combat, and morally ambiguous perspective make for a memorable journey that sets itself apart from the crowd.</p>
<p>Steel yourself, though, for just how much every other character in the game is going to hate you.</p>

                <p>1047 Games announced that the open alpha test for Splitgate 2 will run from February 27 - March 2 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The alpha test includes a new 24-player multi-team experience where players can split into three groups of eight and fight against each other. In these matches, there will be two modes to play: Domination and Hotzone. In Domination, teams will have to take over and control four zones while keeping other teams out. Hotzone works similarly except there's one central zone instead of four individual ones.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHkKQMFuP4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wHkKQMFuP4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two additional new games modes called Splitball and Firecracker. The former combines classic capture the flag mechanics and Halo's Oddball. Players will need to hop between portals into enemy territory and steal Splitballs while defending their own home base. The latter is Spligate 2's take on the classic search &amp; destroy mode.</p><p>There are also three new maps. Glacier accommodates for 8v8v8 battles and is 20 times bigger than any map from the previous game. Bypass is a much more vertical map and Eden is filled to the brim with portal walls.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/" data-ref-id="1100-6525852">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> has today received a free update, bringing new levels and a boost on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>While the game doesn't have separate graphics options, on PS5 Pro players will automatically get a "constant best resolution" at 60 fps.</p>
<p>Five new levels are set to be added, beginning today with Tick-Tock Shock as found in the new Vicious Void Galaxy for players to test their skills.</p>

<p>These levels are more difficult and aim to test jumping skills. And of course, each comes with a new Special Bot to rescue, too.</p>
<p>Players will need to have finished the game to access this new galaxy.</p>
<p>Further levels will be added each week as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 13: Tick-Tock Shock</li>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>"We want to take this chance to thank you, sincerely, for the ongoing support," reads a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/?sf276380355=1">PlayStation Blog</a> article from Team Asobi. "We could not be happier with the way Astro was welcomed into so many new homes.  Your comments, positivity and kind words have carried us through the months and continue to warm our little robotic hearts. Thank you for your loyalty and we shall see you around."</p>

			<p>After several months of quiet, developer Build a Rocket Boy shared a new gameplay trailer for MindsEye, their story-driven action/adventure thriller game, during yesterday's State of Play broadcast. They also revealed that the game will be released this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by IO Interactive</a>.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer on GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA IV, and GTA V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I’ve dedicated my entire career to crafting captivating interactive entertainment to delight players. With MindsEye, we’ve pushed cinematic adventure to the next level - building characters and a world that feels truly alive. We can’t wait for players to step in and feel the immersive realism and tireless effort poured into every moment of the game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Official Gameplay Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSn42TbRngY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye is developed with the same technology that powers <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, the studio's ambitious user generated content (UGC) platform. In this game, players will become Jacob Diaz, who has received a mysterious neural implant (the titular MindsEye) which has left him with disjointed flashbacks of his time in the service.</p>
<p>Set in Redrock, a fictional desert metropolis in the not-too-distant future, MindsEye tells a story of artificial intelligence, human greed, and the struggle for control that has brought the Earth to the brink of collapse. Players will explore a richly detailed world, uncovering hidden conspiracies while navigating a deeply personal and high-stakes narrative.</p>
<p>MindsEye delivers intense combat where every decision is critical to survival. Players will engage in third-person shooter encounters, facing enemies that coordinate attacks, flush them from cover, and swarm with overwhelming force. Success depends on quick thinking, tactical positioning, and using the environment and a companion drone to gain the upper hand. There are also 'thrilling' high-speed chases that will push the player's driving skills to the limit, taking Jacob through a variety of environments, such as bustling cityscapes, remote industrial sites, trailer parks, and deserts. You can now wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

He is inexorably linked with Civilization, and spawned one of gaming’s most infamous bugs: Civilization's ‘Nuclear Gandhi’ — <a href="https://youtu.be/Ur3SdgkW8W4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bug that turned out to be a myth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Gandhi is nowhere to be seen in Civilization 7. So what gives? That’s a question I put to Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach, who gave Gandhi fans a clear ray of hope that eventually he’ll make it in as DLC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/gandhi-1739448996241.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sounds like Gandhi is upcoming DLC for Civ 7. Image credit: Firaxis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I would say we haven't forgotten about anybody who's been in our game before,” Beach said. “Certainly civilizations, there's a lot of consternation right now about where's Great Britain or England, why aren't they in our game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Carthage and Great Britain join Civ 7 as part of The Crossroads of the World Collection DC in March 2025, followed by Bulgaria and Nepal.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But there's sort of a big, longer picture roadmap that we have, and some pieces fit better in the long picture roadmap they do in the short picture one,” Beach continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach went on to explain a bit of Firaxis’ thinking when it came to which Civilizations to add for Civ 7. “One thing I always think about is, we've had the same situation where iconic civilizations haven't been in our base game before,” he said. “We had both Mongolia and Persia missing from the base game of either Civ 5 or Civ 6, and both of those were just massive conquerors who ruled huge chunks of Asia during their time period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we always have to leave somebody out.

			<p>Obsidian know a thing or two about RPGs. Whether creating one of the greatest sequels of all time in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, or providing evidence that they’re more than capable of out-Bethesda-ing Bethesda with Fallout: New Vegas, they’re now presenting us with Avowed, a first-person, high-fantasy RPG set in their homegrown Pillars of Eternity universe. Their flagship talents haven’t dimmed in recent years, and if you’re yearning for the type of evocative fantasy adventures found in games like Morrowind and Oblivion, this is a thoroughly modern, gorgeously presented adventure that places the Pillars of Eternity universe amongst that hallowed company.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbB4-LoURRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avowed takes place in The Living Lands, an untamed region of the the fantasy world of Eora. You are a Godlike, a being touched by a God, their watchful eye intended to grant you various boons, and some colourful face ornamentation, but you are unusual, even for a Godlike. For one thing, you don’t know who your patron God is, and for another you keep hearing a voice in your head. Like I said, unusual.</p>


<p>One of the most immediately interesting things about character creation here is that there’s a visible manifestation of the Gods’ power all over your face, with flora and fauna sprouting from your forehead, cheeks or across your entire face. It can be as subtle as having colourful freckles, or as ostentatious as half a tree coming out of your hair and fungal growths surrounding your eyes. I opted my character’s face to appear wholly made of bark, and, unsurprisingly, you spend a good portion of the opening hours shocking everyone you meet.</p>
<p>You can turn the Godlike visual effects off, but it won’t affect how characters react to you and would be missing the entire point of being an outcast, of being visibly different, of a life of hardship and otherness and dealing with how the rest of the populace treat you. Don’t do it.</p>


<p>The Emperor has sent you to The Living Lands to investigate a plague known as the Dreamscourge, a malady that drives people mad, but which has also begun to take effect upon the landscape and the wildlife itself. This relatively simple opening immediately branches into myriad pieces as you talk to every citizen possible, and then help or hinder them with their tasks.</p>
<p>You’re doubly separate from the population of Paradis and the surrounding areas, as you’re the Aedyran envoy. The previous representatives and soldiers of this nation have sought to subjugate and control the people of The Living Lands when this population of outcasts are used to living freely. It’s the frontier, the edge of the world to some, and you are unwelcome, while your compatriots seem to be aggressive, trigger happy and underhanded. The people, quite rightfully, rankle under Imperial rule, but you can decide which side of the conflict you want to support.</p>
<p>You’ll have to balance how you treat and respond to people via the different speech options during each conversation, being respectful, helpful and kind or aggressive and violent; ie. a complete and utter dick. Your character’s stats and background give you access to additional speech options if they’re high enough, letting you fully immerse yourself in role-playing as your creation, while shaping the conversation or the information you gain from it.</p>

<p>Your choices have consequences, sometimes dire ones, but the way they come back into sight will often surprise you. It feels organic, realistic, and unforced, and it ensures that this feels like a living world (heh), one that you can directly affect through your actions and your words.</p>
<p>The writing here is often intriguing and fantastical, while at other times it’s humorous and down to earth. The setting is magical and arcane, but there’s an underlying sense of reality, emotion and the truth of human existence, the trick being that it manages to be affecting and thoughtful even when you’ve got flowers growing out of your face, and you’re conversing with a glowing entity in a cave.</p>
<p>The exceptional writing is complemented by the stellar voice acting you experience through much of Avowed. Your central companion through the opening of the game, Kai, is voiced by <span>Brandon Keener</span>, the inimitable Garrus in Mass Effect, and frankly, that’s more than enough to give you an indication of how the rest of the game will play out. It’s hard to express what it is that grounds each of the performances here, but, just as with the writing and the narrative, it doesn’t forget the human aspect or the reality of each situation.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things about Avowed is how side-quests are dealt with. As you walk through populated areas, you’ll pick up snippets of conversation – a soldier talking to someone trying to get into the city, a friend telling their companion to pull themselves together – and you can then interrupt them, jumping feet first into their business, and likely adding another quest to the creaking, groaning catalogue of jobs you’ve already accumulated.</p>
<p>Clearly, you should be completing these, turning up interesting personal moments, learning more about the world, and gaining unique equipment or extra materials. They are nearly all interestingly framed, even if the tasks themselves centre on killing things, collecting them or, in the interests of variety, a combination of the two.<br>
</p>
<p>The game plays as a standard in first-person, but there’s an option to switch to a third-person view if that’s more your thing, especially as it gives you a constant view of your Godlike creation and their current armament. With combat in mind you can set two distinct loadouts, switching between them at the press of a button, so you can opt for a melee centred setup with a two-handed weapon as your secondary choice for heftier damage, or mix an axe in one hand, grimoire in the other, and have a bow or arquebus as your ranged alternate. You can also learn magic innately instead of needing to read it from a book, but having one in hand is a shortcut to a broader set of magic spells.</p>
<p>I chose to play as a magical paladin, as comfortable with a sword and shield as with magic, and I loved being able to move back and forth between them while in combat, particularly against the tougher enemies you’ll come across from time to time. Avowed is no slouch, and combat feels increasingly hard won and rewarding. Your companions also play their part here, taking some of the aggro and with abilities that you can call upon from a quick radial menu, both in combat and exploration.</p>
<p>Whatever task or story moment you’re undertaking, Avowed’s world is gloriously creative, gorgeous to look at, and eternally compelling, begging you to check out every spider-web covered nook and mountainous cranny. It’s not wholly unfamiliar – there’s designs that echo those seen in the Elder Scrolls series, and of course, fans of the Pillars of Eternity games will get a kick out of various elements – but it comes together so well. Vistas will make your heart swell, alien foliage will intrigue you, and the various architectural styles can’t help but pique your curiosity.</p>

<p>Playing on PC, there have been some very long initial load times, and the compiling of shaders happens every single time you load the game, when I’m sure most games normally complete it once, and that’s it. It doesn’t detract so much as force you to sit and ponder what you’re about to be doing, but I’m hopeful that a patch will deal with it. Aside from that, it ran very well on our 3070 equipped rig.</p>
<p>The long loading times are echoed on Xbox Series X, where you have a choice between 30fps and 60fps visual modes. We stuck with the latter performance mode, where the game’s art direction still looks handsome, but it does exhibit some distracting quirks with noisy shadows, bright water reflections in the deepest of caves, and some temporal smearing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one thing Obsidian Entertainment is known for, it's for fantastic writing. That was true with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-ii-sith-lords-kotor-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em></a> in 2004, true&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> in 2010, and still true all the way in 2022 with the release of the incredible game that is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review" rel="nofollow">Pentiment</a>. In 2025, we have <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>Fear not, for Obsidian's quality of writing is still there with <em>Avowed</em>. It is, in essence, Obsidian doing what they do best: Adventures with gripping narratives and fleshed-out characters. <em>Avowed</em> is an epic fantasy in the truest sense, giving us one of the best RPGs this decade.</p>

<p>In this ambitious role-playing experience, players can expect to travel across the continent of The Living Lands. A terrible fate awaits those who live in The Living Lands, with an enigmatic malady called the "Dreamscourge" affecting not only its people, but the continent's wildlife and terrain as well. All of these elements are a recipe for a grand adventure.</p>

It's one of the pillars... of eternity!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Avowed</em>:<em> </em>A Wonderful Continuation to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>'s Lore</h2>

<p>First things first,&nbsp;I'd like to acknowledge the setting of <em>Avowed</em>. Yes, it takes place in The Living Lands, but the world itself -- called Eora -- is one that has a great deal of existing lore. <em>Avowed</em> is set within the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pillars-of-eternity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> universe -- the first game of which was released in 2015 and following that several years later in 2018,&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em>.</p>

<p>As a result, <em>Avowed</em> feels like a living world. The lore has had time to develop over the course of a decade, and in doing so, we see a masterful display of worldbuilding in <em>Avowed</em>. Indeed, Carrie Patel, one of the lead writers for <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, is the director for <em>Avowed</em>, and her love for the lore is evident here. It's treated with reverence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you, the player, are the star of the show here. You'll have a great deal of agency over how the plot develops throughout the 40+ hour campaign, with a myriad of side quests with equally excellent writing to string players along.</p>

Godlike are a race of individuals touched by the gods before birth -- they are extremely rare in the world of Eora and that is a very important aspect of your character.</p>

<p>Godlike's appearances are jarring for some. As a side-effect of being a Godlike, your features reflect the characteristics of your deity. In this case, we have fungal growths covering our face and head. This leads to our character being extremely recognizable among the crowd in <em>Avowed</em>, but also sometimes reviled.</p>

I chose to become a noble, and throughout my campaign, I was a selfish, somewhat emotionless individual with undying loyalty for the Empire and hellbent on completing my duty of discovering the cause of the Dreamscourge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most impressive aspect of <em>Avowed</em>'s writing is the ability to roleplay<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Empire wants to colonize the Forgotten Lands, because that's what empires do, of course. As the representative of the Emperor himself, you're often thrust into awkward situations. The locale does <em>not</em> like you, and you can either play as a sympathetic ambassador, a ruthless inquisitor, or anything in between.</p>

I'll keep that in mind.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choices, Choices<em>...</em></h2>

<p>Indeed, it was refreshing to see the amount of dialogue choices in <em>Avowed</em>. At any point during a conversation, I'd consciously decide how I would respond, and nine times out of ten, there would be a dialogue choice that fit exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>This goes back to my original point: You have a great deal of agency over how the story develops. There are a myriad of choices, some inconsequential and some substantial. Many choices will come back to rear its ugly head many hours after the fact.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=30r-N29R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=yd-jq8TM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Companions aren't just static characters -- they are very present in both dialogue and gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>The impact of your choices varies in severity, but rest assured: <em>Avowed</em> is a game where choices <em>do</em> matter. Even your companions (of which there are four) remember your decisions, and they aren't afraid to either shower you with praise or chastise you for your actions.</p>

<p>As for companions themselves, we have a likable bunch of characters. From the reclusive scout Marius to the chaotic wizard Yatzli, these characters will go through arcs of their own, which make them feel more realistic and relatable. They are beneficial in combat too, of course, but writing is what truly makes these individuals shine.</p>

Yes Please!</h2>

<p>Really, I could gush about the narrative for days. Still, <em>Avowed</em> also has excellent combat, loot, and exploration. The way in which Obsidian Entertainment designed these systems makes for an engaging game in both narrative <em>and </em>gameplay.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em>'s gameplay is designed to be versatile. There are numerous weapon types like spears, swords, bows, axes, and uh... guns? Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome. Of course, we can't forget magic and the abilities that come with it, which is just as fleshed out as the other weapon types in <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>A very smart design decision on Obsidian's part was to incorporate two separate weapon load-outs players can switch on the fly. In the middle of combat, I might want to engage the enemy by sneaking up with a bow. Upon getting the enemy's attention, it takes but a moment to switch to melee and fight back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=V8EGiz_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=xfQSzHhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns and magic can indeed work well!</figcaption></figure><p>Some weapons take up two slots, but for most weapons, they are one-handed. This means you can duel-wield, and you are most certainly encouraged to take advantage of this. Holding a pistol in the right hand and a tome of magic in the other allows for a gun-and-sorcery type of build, giving you plenty of combat options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, I stuck with two swords as one loadout and two pistols on the other. Leveling up allows players to spend points into simplified skill trees, so I ended up creating a duelist type of character.</p>

<p>Engaging the enemy with two shots from my pistol either outright kills them or deals a great amount of damage. Enemies, which are often found in packs, would then charge at me. I'd jump into the fray with my two swords and slash away furiously. Increasing my attack speed and damage with one-handed weapons made me a fearsome opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=YhNLtyt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=OMKGx1B0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two swords sounds like a solid set of gear to me!</figcaption></figure><p>While I'm on the topic of enemies, that's one part of <em>Avowed</em> that needs work. Enemy variety leaves me wanting; I could probably count on my hand the number of enemy types. Most of the foes you fight comprise xaurips (lizard men), spiders, keth (an encompassing term for humanoids), skeletons, and bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemies do vary in power, and that is where I find the level system to be quite engaging and innovative. Enemies are not assigned a level, so they don't scale to you as you level up. Instead, enemy power is reflected in item quality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=5e907SDx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=zODDwhwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are also trinkets like rings, as well as boots and gloves to help with your loadout. Take this, uh, Wahaki Tua for example...</figcaption></figure><h2>A Quality Way to Handle Scaling and Gear in <em>Avowed</em></h2>

<p>The whole enemy level/item quality system can be a bit confusing to grasp at first, but once you start picking up loot of better quality and encountering enemies that are a bit stronger, everything clicks. I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character. Perhaps my favorite aspect, however, is unique items.</p>

<p>Unique items are, well, unique. Swords, axes, maces, guns, whatever it is, there's a chance you'll find a unique item in your travels. These are hand-made by Obsidian Entertainment and one-of-a-kind pieces of gear that all have different "unique abilities" attached to them. They also have individualized flavor text to make them stand out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are especially exciting pieces of loot to find, and as a result, exploration feels exceedingly rewarding in <em>Avowed</em>. While you can purchase some of these items from vendors or receive them as quest rewards, it's through exploration that you'll get the bulk of these uniques. You'll find them tucked away in various ruins or stowed in treasure chests.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=lgg36vLq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=07gqUx1z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Why have one pistol when you can use two?</figcaption></figure><p>With the incentive to explore, it makes <em>Avowed</em> feel like an exciting adventure -- you never know what you'll stumble across. Of course, it's important to pick up other, regular ol' items as well because of <em>Avowed</em>'s loot system. It's in this crafting where the game also shines. Basically any item, no matter how low in quality, matters.</p>

<p>Items are broken down into resources (you can also find some of these resources in the world) and are used to improve your weapons and armor. Even if you find junk, it has value because of the resources gained from scrapping them. From there, you can use it to improve the quality of your weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could improve that one unique you found in the starting zone and have it carry you through the whole game, so long as you keep improving on it. I know this because I used a pistol from the first area throughout my entire 40+ hours of play, and it was consistently a great weapon. Items you enjoy using don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-xaurips.jpg?itok=oco4UEpG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-xaurips.jpg?itok=kLGpu0rW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to kill many xaurips.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting for The Living Lands</h2>

<p>All this talk about gear and I've barely touched on combat. Sure, enemies are repetitive, but being able to use the gear you like against your foes makes for a satisfying combat experience. Fighting is fast-paced and simply fun, especially when switching between loadouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffing my attack speed with a perk I unlocked allowed me to eviscerate foes. Enhancing my ability to dodge made me untouchable. I became a force to be reckoned with, and if you're looking for that sort of power fantasy of being the biggest badass in all the realm, well, you can do that here.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Items don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, everything I tried felt viable, and you can respec really quickly if you find that you don't like your current perks. Since you're likely to find so many different weapons, <em>Avowed</em> encourages players to experiment and try different builds, which means combat will always feel fresh if you like trying new things.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> is a gorgeous game, with some of the best environments I've seen in gaming. The art design for The Living Lands is absolutely on point, effectively portraying this fungal-infested, untamed wilderness. There are certain key moments during the game where the overall aesthetic took me by surprise -- moments I won't spoil but you'll know when you see it.</p>

<p>Though I won't be surprised if others experience some instability in their game's performance on PC, such is the price of such a beautiful game. FPS tended to fluctuate on my rig - <em>especially</em> in cities and towns -- which made me a bit too reliant on DLSS and frame generation. Performance will definitely depend on your rig, as always, but it's worth keeping in mind.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That, and there are a lot of bugs in <em>Avowed</em>. Obsidian Entertainment's been very responsive to any bugs and issues reviewers encountered, and there will be a patch to fix many issues, but still... for a game as ambitious and big as <em>Avowed</em>, expect bugs. Just as an example, I wasn't able to complete a few side quests, but that was the worst of it.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> impressed me in many ways. The way it handled gear and enemy scaling, its rewarding exploration, and unparalleled storytelling and world-building are most certainly the highlights, but its combat is also immensely fun. What more can you ask from an RPG? Obsidian Entertainment is one of the best in the business, and that's proven with <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

But that wait isn’t such a big deal when the Xbox has other excellent roleplaying games like <em>Avowed</em>. The latest from <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20959758/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-fallout-series-hero-narrative-xbox-one-ps4-pc"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a> developer Obsidian, <em>Avowed</em> doesn’t shake up the genre. It’s just a really solid fantasy RPG, one that keeps you pushing through with a combination of epic story, delightful companions, difficult decisions, and a true sense of adventure in a massive world.</p><p>The game puts you in the role of a godlike, a race of rare human-like creatures believed to have been blessed by — and thus are close to — the many gods that exist in this world. You’re immediately put to work investigating a deadly plague that is impacting a region known as The Living Lands. It’s an ecological disaster, slowly killing people (after it causes them to go mad) while also being responsible for everything from gigantic sinkholes to <em>very</em> angry bears. <em>Avowed</em> is actually a spinoff of Obsidian’s <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> series, but it serves as a great entry point; I rarely found myself lost or confused, and there’s a handy glossary to help you with key names and places during conversations.</p><p>The larger quest is actually compelling, as far as these things go, and touches on larger themes like imperialism as well as more personal ones, like your character’s connections to the gods. Usually, I ignore the main quest until I can’t, but here, I actually wanted to know what happened, particularly a dozen or so hours in, when the scope of the world becomes clearer. But like in most RPGs, the main storyline is also largely an excuse to push you through the world. <em>Avowed</em> thrives on distraction. You’re off to do one thing, and then you spot something else interesting — a lost character calling for help, a strange glow on the horizon, an ancient ruin buried underground — and you find yourself pulled into something new and completely unexpected.</p><p>I could be describing a lot of fantasy RPGs there. But part of what makes <em>Avowed</em> work is that even those smaller stories and moments are full of intrigue and personality, often bringing you into something larger and deeper than it first seems. So even if a bunch of them are typical fetch quests, the how and why of what you’re doing is enough to make them interesting. Many are funny, others are tragic, and a few are tragically funny. One of my favorites involved dealing with a farmer who was working hard to create a more cost-effective workforce out of reanimated corpses.</p><p><em>Avowed</em> also does a good job of making it feel like you’re part of this world and having an impact. Maybe it’s all an elaborate trick of narrative design, but it felt like my choices mattered. Early on, I let a would-be assassin go free, which caused some initial pain — mostly, my fellow party members got pretty mad at me — but also opened up new story avenues with his faction of rebels.</p><p>Those party members, who you can have long conversations with while camping and complete specific sidequests with to further your relationships, respond to your actions and decisions in ways that feel believable and personal. Sometimes it’s just a little quip in the heat of battle; other times, it’s a long lecture about a choice you made. And those choices can be really difficult: at multiple points, you have to decide in the moment if someone lives or dies, and I often felt unsure of what to do. You can’t make everyone happy — and you definitely can’t keep everyone alive.</p><p>I also really enjoyed feeling like I could roleplay as the godlike adventurer I wanted to be. There are some very fun dialogue options, and I turned my wizard into the intimidating silent type, often responding not with words but with a “raised eyebrow” or “dangerous smile.” The godlikes really stand out in this world thanks to visible physical features. My character had a face full of fungi and tree roots for hair, so I just went with the strong outcast vibe, and it was a blast.</p><p>It’s those smaller, more personal moments that really help set <em>Avowed</em> apart because, structurally and mechanically, it’s pretty standard — if well-tuned — stuff. That means multipart quests that have you running around The Living Lands collecting and returning items and combat that can occasionally become a slog, particularly when you’re fighting huge groups of enemies. There’s a whole lot of dialogue to sift through, though a lot of it is optional, and I found myself skipping very little of it. I also spent way too much time fiddling with an inventory full of identical magic wands and rotten cucumbers.</p><p>But the moment-to-moment storytelling and adventuring is so good that those issues didn’t really bother me. Sometimes you just want a huge, fantastical world to lose yourself in, and there aren’t a lot of them with the scale and quality of <em>Avowed</em>. There’s a reason these games only come around so often — and why the wait can be so hard.</p><div><p><sub>Avowed <em>launches on February 18th on Xbox and PC, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/avowed-guides/521374/release-time-early-access-game-pass-est-pst">with early access starting on February 13th</a>.</em></sub></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this week, Sony set the stage for the rest of this year and beyond with the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a> for 2025. But while looking to the future, Sony didn't forget about the past. During the onslaught of announcements and reveal trailers, Sony noted From Software's 1997 PS1 mecha shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-review/1900-2546613/" data-ref-id="1900-2546613">Armored Core</a>, is coming to PlayStation Plus Classic Games in the near future.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-project-phantasma-review/1900-2546603/" data-ref-id="1900-2546603">Armored Core Project Phantasma</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-master-of-arena-review/1900-2545917/" data-ref-id="1900-2545917">Armored Core Master of Arena</a> are also slated to hit PS Plus Classic Games "soon," although Sony didn't set a specific date for either of those titles to arrive. The most recent game in the series was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/" data-ref-id="1900-6418109">Armored Core 6</a> in 2023, and there hasn't been any concrete word yet about any additional sequels on the way. </p><p>In the more immediate future, the PSP game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/patapon-3-review/1900-6308897/" data-ref-id="1900-6308897">Patapon 3</a> is making the leap to PS4 and PS5 when it joins PlayStation Plus Premium on February 18.

It’s the story of four high school friends reuniting after 27 years without contact. Why they’re getting back together now is, apparently, part of the plot you create with your decisions, but there’s word of a terrible secret they all shared coming back to haunt them.</p><p>Each part is being released as a “tape,” because ‘90s references I guess, the first next week on February 18, and the second (currently) set for April 15. And, both will be included for PS+ subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p><p>But that’s not all that was revealed. Intriguing puzzle game&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.blueprincegame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span>, that calls itself an “atmospheric architectural adventure,” and looks absolutely fascinating. It’s seemingly first-person exploration, but in buildings where the rooms rearrange themselves, and all sorts of secrets are hidden within. It’s an indie piece, published by Raw Fury, and it will be coming straight onto PlayStation Plus this spring.</p><p>Then, in the summer, early access Steam hit <em>Abiotic Factor</em> will arrive on PS+ too. This is an FPS combined with survival sim, for one to six players, set across a bonkers mix of biomes and realms. It’s absolutely <em>adored</em> on PC, so makes for an excellent addition to Sony’s catalogue, especially given it works best when played in groups. If you’ve tried to convince friends to pay for an obscure indie title on console so you can play together, you’ll already know why everyone just have automatic access makes it far more likely to happen.</p><p>Sony is clearly testing the waters here, given its previous defiant refusal to sacrifice those day-one $70 sales for the ongoing income of a subscriber. While these are obviously not games that’d fetch such sums, and the latter two would be harder sells outside of Steam’s more esoteric ecosystem, it’s still a pretty big deal—<em>Lost Records</em> especially, given Don’t Nod’s string of previous mid-price successes.</p><p>Let’s hope it proves popular, enough that PlayStation broadens the day-one options, such that those who can’t afford to pay for multiple $70 games a year might have a cheaper path to entertainment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
