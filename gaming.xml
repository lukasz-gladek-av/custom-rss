            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has started to openly discuss switching <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> away from 5v5 team matches and back to the 6v6 team sizes that defined the original game.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/">Director’s Take blog post</a>, Game Director Aaron Keller digs into the broad debate between 6v6 and 5v5, the advantages that the current form has, its difficulties, and announcing that Blizzard will be holding some gameplay tests to look at how it holds up.</p>


<p>The key reason to switch to 5v5 was to break up a tank-heavy meta. Now, with just one tank per side, there’s just one defensive barrier for a team to break through (double shield was a big issue), making damage character feel more effective, allowing healers to do more than just buff the front line, and making ultimates and ultimate combos less of an integral play.</p>
<p>The other positive side effects were a reduction in matchmaking times as the 1-2-2 format better matches up to what people actually want to play as, easier to read matches as you’re tracking nine other players instead of eleven, and even marginally improved performance.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, players of the game have consistently banged the drum for a return to 6v6. Two tanks both allowed for stronger team compositions that could make up for a weak link, and for heightened moments of chaos when a defensive line does fold. It’s a fun factor that the vocal parts of the community want to have back.</p>

<p>However, Keller notes that, “At the end of the day, we want to make the game that players want to play.” So, if people want 6v6 again, Blizzard needs to look at that.</p>
<p>He continues, “because we operate as a service to our players, we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. &nbsp;Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we’d prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration.</p>
<p><strong>“With that said, we’re looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2</strong>. The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results. This is taking some time, however, for reasons that may not be readily apparent.”</p>
<p>At this point, Blizzard is still just investigating how these tests will look – there’s UI factors like healer vision that need to be looked at, and as mentioned, they may have to find new optimisations to keep performance as it should be.</p>
<p>If the community still wants 6v6 after these tests, and they match up to all of Blizzard’s metrics and analytics, then it could become a permanent switch or a new option.</p>
<p>Keller wraps up:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going to jump on a soap box for a moment. When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it’s clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match. We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel “the same” from game to game. While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we’d like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it. For instance, we think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue. We’ll be running at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea in Season 13. There are some gotchas to this direction, but after reading 400 pages of this blog, I hope you’re all able to see that there are trade-offs to many of the decisions that go into this game (and into any game, really).</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement comes just as Overwatch 2 is about to face fresh competition for its hero shooter crown, with Sony about to launch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> as a premium title, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> free-to-play alternative. Now, more than ever, Blizzard needs to try and keep their community on board.</p>

            <p>No Rest for the Wicked developer Moon Studios has released its first new content update for the early access release.</p>
<p>Known as The Crucible update, it brings a "whole new Crucible" (seems fitting), as well as a new fungal enemy faction known as the Gloam, a new Exalted item status, the promise of "more visceral" combat and more.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser for the update in the video below.</p>

<p>The Crucible is an endgame roguelike dungeon in No Rest for the Wicked, which thanks to this update has been revamped in a bid to improve players' experience.</p>
<p>"With this update, we've more than tripled the number of randomised chambers within the Crucible, introduced a whole new art theme, added a brand new vendor, and introduced an entirely new gameplay system called Echoes," the developer said. </p>
<p>These Echoes will allow players to "customise every run with a huge variety of buffs and effects". In turn, this means players will be able to create a "build on top of your build", leading to more in-game possibilities. </p>
<p>
"Thanks to Echoes and the randomisation of them, no two runs in the Crucible will ever be alike," the No Rest for the Wicked team said.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, players can now "rip, tear, shatter and shred opponents", which certainly sounds more visceral! These effects are more than just for visuals, as players can utilise them to overcome the "treacherous difficulty found in the depths of the Crucible".</p>
<p>If you need a slightly more serene moment after all that ripping and shredding, the No Rest for the Wicked team has also added in some new stray animals to pet.</p>
<p>Full details on No Rest for the Wicked's most recent update - including news it's Steam Deck Verified along with other Quality of Life improvements - can be found on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4338739067969013801">game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"As always, our team is hard at work on awesome new content and features. We're eager to share more details on our Early Access Road Map soon so stay tuned for that," Moon Studios closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to hear back from you. We are always listening and working meticulously on shaping Wicked to be the best it can be."</p>

<p>Back in April, Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler compared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-moon-studios-lord-of-the-rings-says-ceo">No Rest for the Wicked to Lord of the Rings</a>, stating there's plenty to come after the game's 1.0 release. However, despite what many of us want (raises hand), this does mean we shouldn't expect a third Ori game "any time soon". Sigh.</p>

      </div>
<p>As part of this system, EA has also added Player Roles for FC 25, allowing you to set a player's role to deploy them in different ways depending on the situation and your personal strategy. "We built an out-of-game AI model in order to help identify which Player Roles fit players in FC," Parsons explains, adding that some players will have a plus, or a plus-plus indicating that the player is either accomplished or world-class in that role.</p><p>EA is also adding Smart Tactics, a system that will automatically provide tactical suggestions to the player as the game progresses. You can also share useful tactics with friends or followers using a code system.</p><p>FC IQ will be in use across all modes, including Clubs and Career Mode, which EA adds will be getting its own deep dive further down the track. "FC IQ will also influence the core systems in Career relating to Transfers, Scouting, and the Youth Academy," says producer Thomas Caleffi. "Meaning squad building and development goes way beyond just OVRs."</p><p>EA Sports FC 25 will release on September 27, 2024. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-25-preorder-guide-bonuses-release-date-editions/1100-6525124/" data-ref-id="1100-6525124">Preorders are open now</a>, with early unlocks and additional bonuses for players who preorder the game.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s BioShock adaptation has been "reconfigured" to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget.</p>
<p>That's according to producer Roy Lee, who told fans at a panel at San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined.</p>

<p>"The new regime has lowered the budgets," Lee added, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/">Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"So we're doing a much smaller version...It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project."</p>
<p>Lee also told the audience that Netflix had also changed its "compensation strategy" so that, like more traditional film production studios, bonuses are attached to viewership, "motivat[ing] the producers to actually do a move that gets a bigger audience".</p>
<p>Last week, a screenshot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-screenshot-leaks-online-heres-what-it-tells-us">purportedly taken from Cloud Chamber's upcoming BioShock game</a> - codenamed "Parkside" - popped up online.</p>
<p>Whilst the image itself isn't particularly exciting - we can see a weapon, called the "ricochet shotgun" and some kind of weird glowing sphere, er, thing - we do get to see how the UI looked at the time the demo was created (thought to be around 2021), and get our first peek at some of the powers available to players.</p>

		<p>It’s time once again to round out the week with a look back at what’s been keeping our controllers, mice and keyboards busy. For me, it’s been a week of Overwatch 2, and balancing where the best place to play it on the go is, whether that’s on Steam Deck where it looks great but chews through the battery, or Switch where it looks a bit rough and ready, but gets through more than six or so rounds. I’ve had a torrid week of it though, and played resolutely rubbish, sliding down the rankings. I’m blaming being ill.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ve reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> which I really enjoyed, checked out No Man’s Sky and the new update which makes it feel like a new game, and played more Zenless Zone Zero.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 and more RoboCop. But he’s also been to see Deadpool vs Wolverine, which is apparently very good! <strong>Nick P</strong> has been playing a lot of the Marvel Rivals Beta telling us that it’s “REALLY solid. I’m going to put a lot of time into the full game upon release”. He’s also made a good choice and played a lot of Kunitsu-Gami, saying, “I’m in love!”. So, I think he likes it.</p>
<p>Having wrapped up his playthrough of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Aran said it’s a “Decent game overall.” He’s also been playing FM2024 and got Nottingham Forest promoted back to the Premier League after a play-off final against Bristol City that went to penalties. And finally, he’s also started Deadlink for review.</p>

<p><strong>Jim </strong>is continuing with ‘Operation Clearing My Backlog of Open World Games’. He says, “After beating Skyrim, I’ve put my Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough on pause – while I’m really enjoying my time in Night City, I’ve barely had time to touch my PS5. Or, maybe I’ve just got the Bethesda bug? Fallout: New Vegas has shot to the top of my playlist and while it’s definitely showing its age (I’m playing on Steam Deck with no mods) I’m totally absorbed in its world, weighing up which of the warring factions to side with.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> played Elden Ring this week, and he says, “It is clearly great but I don’t think I have the patience to finish it.” He’s also played Mount and Blade Bannerlord, which is, seemingly, “great.” It’s one that I’ve got sat in my ‘to-play’ pile so I need to get into it too!</p>
<p><strong>Steve </strong>has played through the “decent” Flintlock, put some time into Tchia for Microsoft Rewards and started the beautiful Kena on PS5. That’s not all though, telling us, “Alongside these I’ve continued to work through the original Breath of Fire which is great but, my god, games were obscure about progression back then.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been continuing on with his journey through SteamWorld Heist 2, and slowly but surely wrapping his head around how best to fit some nice new ethernet cables under the stairs.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played this week?</p>

            <p>I don't know what the longest-running early access game in history has been (perhaps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-zomboid">Project Zomboid</a>?) but I know that zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/7-days-to-die">7 Days To Die</a> is definitely up there. We first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/7-days-to-die-looks-virally-impressive">reported its appearance</a> back in the dark ages of 2013. For context, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> came out. Whoa! Okay, calm down, sorry, I didn't mean to panic you. Yes, the arrow of time is inviolable. We are all marching steadily towards our graves, I know. But at least now 7 Days To Die has finally released its fully baked version 1.0.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The 1.0 release comes out today and brings "more optimizations, polish, quality-of-life improvements, new content, new features, and new gameplay systems than ever before," say developers The Fun Pimps, who must surely be tired. </p>

<p>Their summary is also putting it somewhat mildly. The <a href="https://7daystodie.com/v1-0-official-release-notes/">full patch notes</a> are enormous. The world generation has been beefed up, making it faster and, theoretically, resulting in more interesting worlds. A bunch of new "points of interest" will now appear, including new theatres, high schools and hotels. There are new zombie variants (though I think this is mostly a cosmetic thing, for example, a new type of nurse zombie and a "bowling alley" zombie). There are new animal and vehicle models, lighting has been overhauled, a "new and improved Dismemberment Gore System" will make things bloody in some fresh ways, and there are now various "challenges" to act as tutorials for new players (replacing an old system of quests). There's a bunch more stuff besides this that I cannot face communicating to you, lest it add another decade to the clock.  </p>
<p>Even after all that, the developers say they're not done working on the game. A roadmap for future updates includes hints of a weather system, an overhaul of traders, new bandits, and a story mode. All that is set to take them up to the end of 2025, they say. </p>
<p>I last played the horde-blasting starvation sim ten years ago, following its first shambling onto the scene. I liked it back then, enjoying the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/7-days-to-die-diary">lonely log cabin defending</a> and simple nightly defenses of my new home (then getting absolutely destroyed by a much bigger swarm). I'll be diving back in to let you know how it holds up after all this time. It's possible a decade of half-hearted survival games has blunted the edge of my enjoyment of the genre. But I do like digging pits for zombies to fall into. Check back for fuller thoughts sometime next week.</p>

            <p>
UK actors' union Equity stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA following news of a strike, though won't be authorising a strike itself.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union announced a strike after failing to reach a deal with major video game companies over the use of AI</a> following "more than a year and a half of negotiations".

</p>
<p>
"Equity stands in total solidarity with SAG-AFTRA who have taken the brave decision to authorise a strike against US video games companies," reads a <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/campaigns-policy/international-work/solidarity-statement-advice-regarding-sag-aftra-interactive-media-industrial-action-2024">statement from Equity</a> assistant general secretary John Barclay.

"Voice and performance capture artists are a vital part of this multibillion-dollar industry, bringing to life characters that make games successful. We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members' rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation.
</p>
<p>
"In light of the strike authorisation, it is incumbent on the studios, producers and game developers that are operating in the UK to be transparent with performers and inform our members if they are commissioning work for a struck company. Excessive non-disclosure agreements should not be used to undermine the bargaining position of the creative workforce."

<p>
Equity is "very concerned about the lack of safeguards to protect performers in the unregulated world of AI alongside our members' health and safety, which is not always being taken seriously".
</p>
<p>
Barclay then states the games industry benefits "hugely" from tax relief in the UK. "In 2022, nearly £200m was paid to games companies in tax relief, and a total of £830m has been paid out since 2014," he says. "Despite this huge financial gain to games companies, pay has stagnated and does not reflect our members' valuable contribution. 
</p>
<p>
"Equity remains committed to constructive dialogue with voice studios, performance capture studios, publishers, developers and trade bodies and we urge the industry to work with the union so that we can resolve these ongoing issues."
</p>
<p>
So why isn't Equity also striking? In an FAQ following the statement, Equity explains that "industrial relations legislation in the United Kingdom is very restrictive" and the "employment status of Equity members makes it even more difficult to overcome those hurdles in this context".
</p>
<p>
It continues: "Crucially, Equity does not have a collectively bargained agreement with the major UK video games vendors, which means we are not able to enter into a formal dispute like our sister union. The union has worked hard to try and establish collective agreements in the video games industry for many years, but we have faced ongoing resistance from the industry. The lack of collective agreements for video games stands in stark contrast to the UK film and TV industry, where collective bargaining is the norm."
</p>
<p>
Instead, Equity is working on its own programme to protect the rights of performers.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-and-equity-are-battling-the-rise-of-ai-driven-deepfake-mods">Equity released its "ground-breaking AI toolkit"</a> and called for urgent government action against what it calls "performance cloning".

</p>
<p>
Another wrinkle detailed in the FAQ is that SAG-AFTRA members contracted to work in the UK for a struck company are unable to go on strike due to UK law. "As the strike has been authorised under legislation in the United States but is not lawful under United Kingdom legislation, you have no protection against being dismissed or sued for breach of contract by the producer or your engager if you take strike action or refuse to cross a picket," it reads.
</p>
<p>"SAG-AFTRA's dispute is not lawful under United Kingdom law. Whilst we stand in solidary, this is not an Equity dispute, and you are free to accept work."</p>
<p>Actors have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-remain-sceptical-about-the-use-of-ai-in-gaming">voiced their concerns about AI</a> over the last couple of years. I spoke with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> actors at the BAFTA Gaming Awards who revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">the darker side of the game's success fuelled by AI voice cloning</a>.</p>

            <p>Chaotic poker-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> quickly captured hearts and frazzled minds when it released earlier this year. However, nowhere in Katharine’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">review</a> does it address the one eternal issue: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/can-it-run-doom">can it run Doom</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, according to reddit user UwUDev, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1eby5y7/literally_nobody_asked_for_it_but_here_it_is_doom/">shared their prototype</a> for how the seminal FPS could be played within the confines of a comedy poker game. The answer, apparently, is to just turn a big pile of Joker cards into portions of a video screen. A simple solution, though one that quickly caught the <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1816567788078870924">approving attention</a> of Balatro dev LocalThunk.</p>
<p>Thus spake UwUDev: "It's super laggy and I often have big lag spikes but it works. I'll see later if I can optimize it because it's really unplayable x)". Wait, if the creator says it’s unplayable then can we truly say Doom is running? Is this a 'minimum 30fps or jog on' situation or do we lower our standards considering someone got it working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">jailbroken tractor</a>?</p>
<p>After some initial umming, I think I’d fall into the "lower our standards" camp – surely Doom does not need to actually be <em>comfortable</em> to play for official Can It Run Doom certification, as long as it merely runs. But then this Balatro mod stretches the definition of "runs" as it so heavily manipulates and reshapes the game’s systems that it arguably no longer even resembles the original; at least the tractor screen was intended as a screen. I don’t think Balatro cards were ever meant to be vessels of video output, even if it is fun how shuffling them around also moves the corresponding window of Doom footage.</p>
<p>Then, of course, you get into arguments over whether the wacky device needs to simply <em>display</em> Doom, or to handle the actual processing for it, and honestly at this point I think the fun just stops. Maybe this post should as well, so just go look at the <a href="https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/">It Runs Doom! Tumblr</a>.</p>

            <p>I keep seeing those adverts for that Ray-Ban and Meta collaboration, where like, they're smart glasses that let you browse the web with your eyes? Anyway, yeah, they don't appeal to me at all. Not as much as "Dateviator" glasses, which come courtesy of Sassy Chap Games and their upcoming dating sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/date-everything!">Date Everything!</a> As the title suggests: you date everything, from kitchen sponges to lampshades, as they morph into absolute fitties once you've donned the special specs. It looks incredibly dumb but in the best possible way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what's been coined as a "sandbox" dating simulator, the game sees you explore a home from a first-person perspective and don the Dateviator glasses to chat up everyday objects. We're talking hoovers, cabinets, toasters, fridges - pop those glasses on and anything becomes 10/10 shaggable. While there's not much info on exactly why or how or who or what is going on, the devs do say there's a "critical path tying it all together", with all dateable objects having three "relationship resolutions": Love, Friend, or Hate. Imagine leaning in for a kiss with a nail clipper and getting pied. Unthinkable.</p>

<p>There are other tidbits of info, like there being 100 fully voiced dateable characters (things?) all voiced by strong voice actors from all sorts of games like Final Fantasy XV, Persona 5, HiFi Rush and more. Not to mention that the game will cater for a "wide array of player preferences and tastes", so everyone can get involved in… whatever this game is.</p>
<p>It has got me thinking, though. What household object in my home would I date? My coaster? My laptop sleeve? Truthfully, I think it would be my Sonic The Hedgehog lamp that isn't actually of the character Sonic, but just the words "Sonic The Hedgehog". Dear reader, what household object would you date? I am sure I won't regret asking you such a thing.</p>
<p>There isn't a release date yet, but you can follow the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Steam</a> if you're curious.</p>

Coral Island developer Stairway Games has responded to the lack of Switch port, blaming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">recent layoffs at Humble Games</a> for leaving console versions "in a place of uncertainty".

</p>
<p>
The cosy life-sim game received over $1.6m in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/faqs">Kickstarter funding</a>. However, some backers who specifically backed the game for a Switch version are angry at the lack of news for a port. Other backers have claimed requests for PS4 keys have been automatically upgraded to PS5 without consent.
</p>
<p>
At present, the game is available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (plus Game Pass), but not Switch.

<p>
Comments from backers have been shared on social media, describing the situation as "super gross". "At this point, I just want my money back," wrote one backer. "I can't get what I paid for, so I'd like to be refunded."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coral Island made $1M from kickstarter campaign which included Switch players. There is still no Switch version of the game and these backers are not being offered alternative keys. Essentially being ghosted after they helped fund the game. Why is no one talking about this? <a href="https://t.co/mmeCih248z">https://t.co/mmeCih248z</a></p>— Jupie ✨ (@jupieverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/jupieverse/status/1816135472323641831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Now, Stairway Games has released a statement addressing the situation, claiming "the impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles... as they are responsible for these platforms".
</p>
<p>
"To start, we share in your frustrations regarding the lack of a Nintendo Switch port of Coral Island," the statement reads. "Over the years, there's a lot we've wanted to say in the spirit of transparency, about many different things, but continue to be unable to do so because of the publishing agreement and NDA we have in place.
</p>
<p>
"The impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles, whether porting or pushing hotfixes, as they are responsible for these platforms. We've been in communication with our lawyer since we found out about the restructuring on social media to figure out how to navigate this new situation.
</p>
<p>
"For example, we have an upcoming hotfix for the 1.1 update nearing release for Steam. We have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don't have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out. We only have access to the Steam backend."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
As a result, Switch backers are now being offered a key change to Steam, effective immediately, by emailing the developer: contact@stairwaygames.com. However, this doesn't account for the fact some backers may not have a suitable PC to play the game.
</p>
<p>
"We'll keep you posted on developments once we have more information," the statement concludes. "We know it fucking sucks but we hope you understand."
</p>
<p>
It should be noted, though, the Humble Games layoffs occurred just earlier this week. The Coral Island Kickstarter was launched in 2021 and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-island-farming-sim-coral-island-leaves-pc-early-access-in-november">game released out of early access in November 2023</a>.

</p>
<p>
Until now, the only comment for Switch backers on Kickstarter was: "We're still in the game development process and going strong. We don't have any updates to share yet, but we'll keep you informed as soon as we have more to share."
</p>
<p>
The tropical island farming sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-farming-kickstarter-success-coral-island-now-in-early-access">launched into early access in October 2022</a> after its successful Kickstarter campaign. Since then, it's received plenty of updates adding new content, including its 1.1 "Story Finale: Land &amp; Sea" update this week.

</p>
<p>
It's considered a major competitor to Stardew Valley, whose solo developer earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">stated he would "never" charge money for a DLC or update</a> "for as long as I live".

Sony had said it would mainly affect the suspension physics model and tire physical calculation model, “resulting in much more natural weight shifting during cornering.” Tire response was also said to have been improved, along with more realistic tire heating and wear. “Look forward to more dynamic car movement and a further polished driving feel,” Ken Chan, senior product manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-49-brings-six-new-cars-updated-physics-simulation-model-and-more-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p><p>But following the update's release, player discovered that cars had a tendency to bounce their way down the track, or even fly off as Gran Turismo 7's new physics model broke down.

			<p>March 2020 seems a very long time ago, but it was start of probably the biggest world event any of us will live through. Billions of people were effectively forced to stay home for months at a time through the pandemic, and the impact of that event continues to this day as working from home is for many, normal. We have reconfigured our homes to have multiple functions, so as I type this, I’m at my desk which has three monitors, my work laptop, and my music studio PC, and my PS5 just off to the right. So, it would be damn handy if there was a sturdy chair that I could use both for work and gaming, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451520">To give you an idea of the size, here’s the C7 box next to another office chair purchased from Amazon.</p>
<p>The Flexispot C7 Air is an all-in-one solution to this problem, a premium office chair that also works if you want so slouch back and play some video games. Since the chair is packed full of features and very sturdy it comes in a rather large box and weighs 25kg, You do need to assemble it yourself, but it’s rally just a case of slotting a few things together and using the supplied tool to tighten a few bolts, it’s really quite simple. Even so, the weight and shape mean it’s best if you have a friend to give you a hand.</p>


<p>Once assembled there are plenty of features to adjust including the height, arm rests, and head support, but it’s the lumbar support that is star of the show. Flexispot have done some nifty engineering and the arc-shaped mesh support hinges from the bottom to always find the right place no matter what position you are in. This means you are always sitting in the correct position and fully supported and frankly it’s been a game changer for me and my back.</p>
<p>As soon as you sit down you can feel the gentle pressure of the cushion which pushes your back into the correct place no matter how you sit. Even if you slouch back or lean forward it adapts and Flexispot have taken all sorts of positions in to account – you can even sit cross-legged in the chair. That does seem like a bold claim but I can report that a 6ft5″ 120kg man (i.e. me) can do that, although I did have to use the attached foot rest to support my (humble brag) massive legs.<br>
</p>

<p>While you’ll likely be sitting up while working, the C7 can recline to what almost feels a dangerous angle – it’s not, I’ve tried to make the chair tip over without success. The lumbar support is still in full effect here, so even if you are technically slouching you are fully supported. It’s in this relaxed mode the chair is best for gaming, especially if you add the optional foot rest. I have played many a Destiny 2 marathon without a single ache or pain, but I think the best compliment I can give is that I fell asleep not once, but twice whilst in this position.</p>
<p>The chair is extremely well made and solid and while I can’t comment on the long term durability given the time I have been using the chair, I can tell you that back in 2021 I reviewed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/23/flexispot-e7-electric-standing-desk-review/">Flexispot E7 desk</a> and it’s still the desk I use today. I have not had a single issue with it and the C7 Air seems just as sturdy and durable. It’s also worth mentioning that the chair comes with a&nbsp; five year warranty just in case something does go wrong.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451526">The C7 and proof that even giant, grumpy looking oafs can sit cross legged in it.</p>
<p>To use an old but accurate phrase, “You get what you pay for”. I have worn out countless £100-200 gaming chairs, with their foam padding and fake leather eventual degrading through basic use and, speaking from experience, leaving lots of bits of fabric across the carpet. The Flexispot C7 Air Chair is more expensive and usually retails for £399 but the company has regular sales – in fact there is one on now and you can grab it for <a href="https://flexispot.co.uk/premium-ergonomic-office-chair-c7-air.html">£299. </a> I know that’s still a lot of money, but it’s by no means the most <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/sihoo-doro-s300-chair-review/">expensive premium chair around</a>, and a good chair is an investment now that your back will thank you for a decade from now.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A good chair is like finding the love of your life, you didn't know you needed it until it arrives. The Flexispot C7 supports you without you even noticing and is quite happy for you to fall asleep in it's arms, if it could cook me dinner then I'd ditch the boyfriend.  	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206720/steam-game-demos-update-library-store-pages<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has introduced some changes to Steam that should make it easier to find and install playable game demos. In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">new events blog post</a>, Steam said the “Great Steam Demo Update” was based on developer and player feedback, with new functionality that makes demos behave more like standalone games hosted on the platform.</p><p>For one, demos can now have a store page that’s completely separate from the main game, allowing developers to display demo-specific content like trailers, screenshots, and supported features. These pages will also display buttons to both install the demo and visit the main game’s store page, and allow players to leave demo-specific reviews.</p><p>And if a demo becomes available for a game that users have on their wishlists, or from a developer that they follow, those users can now be notified via email or mobile alerts. Demo listings can also now appear on the same lists and category pages as free games, such as the “New &amp; Trending” section of Steam’s homepage charts. Alongside free games, users may see demos appearing more frequently as Steam says it’s made “some changes to the thresholds” in order to “better balance them with paid products.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Free games and the newly supported gaming demo listings will appear more frequently in Steam’s charts.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Steam</cite></p></div><p>Other new features in this update include the ability to add demos to Steam libraries without immediately installing them, allowing demos to be installed even if the user already owns the full game, and making it easier to remove demos by right-clicking on them. When the demos are uninstalled they’ll also be removed from the user’s library.</p><p>The visibility changes introduced in this update may resurface older demos on user accounts, with Steam saying “We’ve tried our best to clean up the demos that we expect you don’t care about anymore, but we may have missed some.”</p><p>Amusingly, Steam added a note in the “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563#:~:text=Q.%20What%20is%20the%20deal%20with%20the%20Demo%20icon%3F%20Is%20that%20a%20plate%3F%20A%20vinyl%20record%3F">infrequently asked questions</a>” section of the blog for users who don’t know that Steam’s demo icon is based upon the Compact Disc, not a dinner plate. Am I so old that we’re really at the point of modernizing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16505912/floppy-disk-3d-print-save-joke-meme">save icon / floppy disk</a> gag?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> games could be getting the remaster treatment. An attendee at San Diego Comic-Con was looking at a set of figures based on characters from the series when they saw that the plaque accompanying the figures was labelled with the words "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" alongside the logo for Crystal Dynamics. I suppose if you throw a coin enough times, one day it will land on the side with the head of a jawless vampire on it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>An image of the plaque was posted by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">Resetera</a>. A reporter from Gamespot went over to the display cabinet to see for themselves, but the sign <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">had by then been removed</a>. There's not much more to go on than that. The QR code on the plaque takes you to a newsletter signup page for Dark Horse comics, which is probably connected to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-getting-a-canonical-prequel-graphic-novel-starring-everyones-favourite-jawless-monologuing-vampire">the prequel comic</a> subtitled "The Dead Shall Rise", coming soon from Dark Horse. </p>
<p>No remaster of the games has yet been announced by Crystal Dynamics themselves. Although the company's CEO Phil Rogers has previously said <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/legacy-of-kain-crystal-dynamics-says-it-hears-fans-loud-and-clear-after-100k-survey-responses/">in earnings calls</a> that they were putting out feelers to see if players would be interested in revisiting the dark realm of Nosgoth. The 25th anniversary of the first Soul Reaver game is also coming up in August. So it's possible the remasters might be sprung on fans to coincide with that. Or maybe that's wishful thinking.  </p>
<p>Whatever the plans, I know Nic will be pleased to see the scurrilous dimension-hopping vampires get a much-delayed facelift. Meanwhile, I only have vague memories of the Legacy of Kain series, and recall the opening cinematic of the first Soul Reaver better than any subsequent levels. That bit where Raziel gets <a href="https://youtu.be/4DOKzTHaPfM?feature=shared&amp;t=162">tossed into the very hot soup</a> and becomes all disfigured and skinny. He lies at the bottom of that green abyss for an eternity, untouched. Perhaps he's about to get up?</p>

            <p>
In a pleasantly surprising move, BioWare will launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> natively via Steam on PC, meaning there's no need to download and install the fussy EA App. 
</p>
<p>
What's more, the game will arrive verified for Steam Deck, so you can continue your quest to defend Thedas while on the bus, train or toilet. 
</p>
<p>
"There's a few more surprises in store for later this summer," BioWare's Michael Gamble <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1816514374670168113">teased</a> via social media platform X, sharing the news. "Here's the first from the DAV team."

<p>
Gamble is a familiar face on social media, though his day job is leading BioWare's Mass Effect team. Still, it's likely he's referring to further Dragon Age details, in the run up to BioWare's next project launching at some poin this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the news of Dragon Age: The Veilguard launching native via Steam, games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said he believed the decision by EA would "lead to significant additional sales".
</p>
<p>
"The margin benefit of forcing people to use a proprietary PC marketplace just isn't worth the lost additional volume of not putting a game on Steam," he <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1816550005005824509">wrote</a> on X.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's long-awaited Dragon Age: The Veilguard still lacks a launch date, but is expected to arrive sometime this autumn for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Our Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">got a good look at it recently and came away very impressed</a> - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-dragon-age-veilguard-does-kill-varric-it-will-be-long-overdue">we're worried for the safety of veteran fan-favourite character Varric</a>.

            <p>As of today, the The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike of the Interactive Media Agreement - effectively, video game voice acting, motion capture work, and other roles, the full list of which can be found <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">here</a>. The strike comes after over 18 months of negotiations with some of gaming’s largest companies - including Activision, EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, and WB Games - over AI protections.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Any game looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform covered work must sign on" to agreements <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">specified in a post</a> by the guild, “These agreements offer critical AI protections for members."</p>
<p>"We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," said president Fran Drescher. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games," said national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. "That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies."</p>
<p>"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation," said Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. "We will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve."</p>

</figure>
<p>The strike was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885558/sag-aftra-strike-authorization-negotiation-video-game-voice-actors">voted for</a> in 2023, and marks the second of it’s type since 2016, where videogame actors at SAG-AFTRA went on strike for almost a year. This January, SAG-AFTRA struck a deal to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">allow AI voice replicas under licence</a> with company REPLICA, which drew criticism from several prominent actors who felt blindsided and betrayed by the development. "I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors working in games," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deux Ex</a> actor Elias Toufexis. "From what I'm seeing, no one asked any of my peers either."</p>
<p>Last December, union ZeniMax Workers United <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-and-zenimax-union-reach-first-of-its-kind-agreement-over-usage-of-ai-tools-in-gamedev">came to a "first of its kind" agreement</a> with Microsoft over the usage of AI tools in game development. Per the agreement, ZeniMax will "provide notice to the union in cases where AI implementation may impact the work of union members," with the union able to bargain.</p>
<p>AI remains a hot button issue, to put it mildly, and undoubtedly a factor in the staggering number of layoffs across the industry over the past two years, as the sort of people who choose to involve themselves in art despite seemingly have nothing but contempt for both artists and the art itself jump on cost-cutting measures with avaricious glee.</p>
<p>This strike, at least, comes at the end of a week filled with heartening developments, with two large wall-to-wall unions formed under Microsoft by workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">at Blizzard</a>. If you want to find out whether a game you either play or are looking forward to playing is under the scope of the strike, you can search <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result">here</a>. If anyone harasses anyone over this, I will personally escort you to the nearest bin and seal the lid with hot glue. Don’t be a scab now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The two Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver games could get remastered in the future, judging from some pictures taken during this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">ResetERA forums</a> by user Mama Robotnik, two statues depicting Cain and Raziel are being shown during the event with a Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered branding. The attached QR Code leads to a Dark Horse newsletter sign-up, so something is definitely brewing. Original developer Crystal Dynamics has yet to make any announcement, but with the branding being out, it's likely that one is not too far off in the future.</p>
<p>It has been a very long time since the release of any Legacy of Kain game. The final one, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-defiance-looks-incredible-with-reshade-ray-tracing/">Defiance</a>, was released back in 2003, bringing a close to both Kain and Raziel's stories and, apparently, the series as a whole. The game was supposed to be followed by the multiplayer title Nosgoth, which reached an open beta stage in early 2015 but was eventually canceled with the servers shutting down in 2016. Hopefully, the two remasters will pave the way for more remasters to offer modern players the chance to experience the entirety of the series and a new entry in what I personally consider one of the best gaming series of all time.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its members have voted on a videogame strike after over a year and a half of negotiations with game developers and publishers.</p>
<p>24 of the 25 sticking points have been agreed upon. However, the remaining point is a big one: AI. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.</em></p>
<p>National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated:</p>
<p><em>The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.</em></p>
<p>Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh added:</p>
<p><em>Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation. We refuse this paradigm – we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide A.I. transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.</em></p>
<p>For its part, Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the main negotiation group that includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.</em></p>
<p>While such strikes in the gaming industry aren't nearly as crippling as they are for movies or TV shows, they could still result in delays. The massively anticipated GTA 6 could be one of those games, according to a quick search in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAG-AFTRA's videogame status database</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, let's hope an agreement can be reached shortly.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earth-defense-force-6">Earth Defense Force 6</a> players on Steam aren’t happy about having to sign into the Epic Games Store, it seems. The latest entry in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> ant-control shooter launched yesterday, and critics reckon it's a decent time. Still, it’s currently sitting at an angry red 'mostly negative' on Steam. In response, D3PUBLISHER have put out an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378?l=english">apology statement</a>, reassuring players that this third-party log in will only be required once.</p>

<p>"For this game, to enhance cross play and online functionality. Online play requires signing in to your Epic Games account. We apologize for the lack of advance notice," reads the statement. "Signing in to your Epic Games account is required the first time you play online. Usually, once you sign in for the first time, you will not need to sign in again." It then goes on to give helpful instructions for creating a free Epic account.</p> <figure>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/io_UDlG6KyY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" height="113" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" title="EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 6 - Release Date Trailer" width="200"></iframe><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</figure>
<p>That "lack of advance notice" part seems to be key. While the game’s Steam page has now been updated to show that the game requires an Epic Online Services account for online play, D3PUBLISHER neglected to inform players beforhand. Personally, I feel it’s worth everyone signing up for Epic anyway, because free things are nice, but it does seem like the sort of thing it would have been triflingly easy for the publisher to be transparent about instead of apologising after the fact.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's likely any less disheartening for the developers, however, and I do often wonder about the logistics of having two seperate user review categories on Steam so these kind of issues don't spill over into tarnishing the perception of a game's actual quality. Although, even typing this now, I can sense how utterly naive that probably sounds. No-one wants double the clown emojis. </p>
<p>This is the first title in the Earth Defense Force series to require such a third party login. It is not the first in the series to require that you kill an alarming number of big ants, however. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/earth-defense-force-5-review">I quite liked</a> Earth Defense Force 5 when I played it for review. "A thoroughly confident and largely successful game that seems solely designed for you and some mates to laugh with it, at it, and at yourselves until the frogs come home," wrote I. "It’s camp, sure, but as Susan Sontag put it, 'Oh no! The bugs, they’re everywhere! The frogs! They’re too big!'" I have since learned that quote was anachronistic, however. It was actually John Waters.</p>

			<p>In February 2022, Take-Two and Netflix <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered</a> to create a live action film adaptation of the BioShock game franchise. Around six months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Francis Lawrence, the director of Hunger Games, Constantine, I Am Legend, Sparrow, and Slumberland, would be taking care of the project.</p>
<p>Later that year, Lawrence himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-has-ken-levine-involved-in-some-capacity-director-explains-what-makes-the-ip-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about what makes BioShock unique. He also confirmed that franchise creator Ken Levine would be involved in some capacity.</p>
<p>We haven't heard any further news about the BioShock film for a long while. Now, Variety has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> some news that came out of San Diego Comic-Con 2024, where producer Rory Lee said in a panel:</p>
<p><em>The new regime has lowered the budgets, so we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view as opposed to a grander, big project.</em></p>
<p>That's all Lee had to share about the project, though he also confirmed that Francis Lawrence is still attached to direct. The thing is, the movie director also has many other movies to handle.</p>
<p>Production is currently ongoing for The Long Walk (an adaptation of the 1979 dystopian horror novel penned by Stephen King). The script of the long-awaited Constantine 2 is currently being written, as revealed at SDCC 2024, and I Am Legend 2 is being prepared as well. Moreover, Lawrence is also in talks to direct yet another The Hunger Games prequel titled Sunrise on the Reaping.</p>
<p>There's no word yet on when the BioShock movie will be produced, then, or even on the cast. Fans can't even take solace from any new games, as Cloud Chamber is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for its next installment, hinting that the release is still a few years off. There was, however, a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-screenshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> showing off the user interface and a ricochet gun.</p>

            <p>
This summer, Epic Games finally gets its wish when, thanks to new EU regulations, it's launching its own digital store on iOS and Android. And ahead of its arrival, the company has announced it's removing Fortnite and other Epic games from what it calls "rent collector" competing stores, "even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores">announcement post</a>, Epic first confirms developers selling games on its on its new mobile store will be subject to the same 12 percent fee seen on its PC digital storefront (zero percent if a developer uses a third-party payment system). It then reveals plans to pull its own games from some competing stores. More specifically, it says it'll be "ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collectors without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
It's also pulling Fortnite and its other titles from the Samsung Galaxy Store, in what it calls "protest of Samsung's anticompetitive decision to block side-loading by default" on its devices. Conversely, Epic says it's planning to brings its own mobile games to stores that "give all developers a great deal". One of these will be the <a href="https://altstore.io/">indie-focused AltStore</a>.

<p>
The reason for all this, it insists, is that "we want to do everything we can to support other stores that strive to bring all developers their own great deals." Of course, it probably also helps that by manoeuvring its games from major to minor competing stores, it's pretty much guaranteeing most Fortnite traffic on mobile will come through its own store, where it won't need to pay a cut on its revenue at all.
</p>
<p>
Epic has been battling to return to iOS ever since Fortnite was booted out of Apple's ecosystem in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">deliberately circumvented</a> contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app. Attempts to reverse Apple's decision through legal means have largely been unsuccessful in the US, with courts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">predominantly ruling in Apple's favour</a> as time has gone on. However, the EU's Digital Markets Act has now provided the Fortnite maker with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">means of getting its foot back in the door</a> - in the EU at least.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store is set to launch on iOS in the EU and Android worldwide later this year. Epic has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">said</a> it'll be bringing Fortnite and its store to iOS in the UK in the "second half of 2025". That announcement might be a little premature, however, given there's still much to be determined around the UK's new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.
