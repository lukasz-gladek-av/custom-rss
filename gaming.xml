            <p>
Four years after its initial announcement, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot has finally resurfaced, offering a first gameplay reveal for this reimagining of developer Rare's classic spy-flavoured first-person shooter.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">back in December 2020</a>, Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot was initially being developed exclusively by The Initiative, a studio specifically set up to handle its creation. However, the project has been hit by numerous set-backs since then and Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics was eventually bought in to help get it over the finish line.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">troubled development</a> have continued to dog the Perfect Dark reboot - it was described as still being in a "very rough state" back in May - so it's perhaps a bit of a surprise to see a first gameplay trailer at this juncture. But that's exactly what Microsoft has shared during its latest Xbox Games Showcase, serving up nearly three and a half minutes of the shooter in action.

<p>
As per an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-details-interview-xbox-games-showcase-2024/">update on Xbox Wire</a>, the trailer shows Joanna Dark skulking around the Perfect Dark reboot's near-future Cairo setting, with The Initiative crafting an "entirely new story and universe" for this latest outing. It all unfolds in a world impacted by The Cascade - a series of environmental disasters which have rendered entire regions inhospitable - and hypercorporations have now stepped in to help the regeneration efforts, but their motives may be less than altruistic.
</p>
<p>

As so enters Joanna Dark in a single-player adventure playing out across a series of set missions - said to have been designed to give players choices in how they play out. Melee and gunplay are supported, for instance, and Joanna (here voiced by Alix Regan with Elissa Bibaud lending her visual likeness) can deploy various parkour abilities for use in both traversal and combat. That's on top of stealth mechanics and a "liberal use of gadgets".
</p>
<p>
The gamepaly trailer unfolds in Garden City - a more affluent and cosmopolitan area of near-future Cairo - with Joanna's gadgets enabling her to scan NPCs, analyse NPC voices, and create vocal "deepfakes" to trick security systems or impersonate other characters. There's also a look at lethal and non-lethal weaponry, close-quarters combat, special abilities, and quiet or loud approaches to tackling missions.
</p>
<p>
There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.

Annapurna revealed new teen drama game Mixtape from the developer of The Artful Escape, featuring skateboards, romance, and an iconic soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
Developer Beethoven and Dinosaur's next game was shown at the Xbox Game Showcase: a coming-of-age action adventure game with a soundtrack featuring DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and more.

The plot will follow three teens in Northern California as they leave high school, taking inspiration from classic movies and full of nostalgia.
</p>
<p>
With a bright and colourful stop motion art style and vintage soundtrack, this was a real stand out from the Xbox Game Showcase.
</p>
<p>
However, it's set for release across Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation, and PC (Windows, Steam) in 2025.

            <p>Arguably one of the more intriguing new game announcements from tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG from French studio Sandfall Interactive. </p>
<p>Combining fantasy and 'Belle Époque' art influences, you'll be leading the titular expedition to try and stop the mysterious Paintress, a being who's slowly wiping out the last remnants of humanity by painting numbers on a strange monolith - with each number killing off everyone born in that particular year.</p>
<p>A slightly convoluted setup to write down in words, perhaps, but the idea of your 'number being up' and having fewer and fewer folks to help aid you in your fight against fate with every passing year is strong indeed, so why not have a gander at the reveal trailer below: </p>
<figure>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDyqGZy78Ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>In addition to its neat premise, I'm also keen to get my hands on its turn-based combat, because cor, I'm a sucker for a good battle UI, I really am, and Expedition 33's looks really quite stylish. It's unclear whether the turn order on the left of the screen can be disrupted in any way (I also love a good turn disruption, me), but as we can see from the trailer, there will be QTEs of varying kinds to execute your really quite hefty-looking specials. </p>
<figure>

<p>In a press statement, publisher Kepler Interactive have fleshed out some of these details a bit further, saying players will be able to dodge, parry and counter enemy assaults in real-time. There will also be a free-aim system to target weakspots, and plenty of opportunities to customise your party's stats, skills and gear to suit your personal playstyles. </p>
<p>All in all, I'm on board. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming out in 2025 and will arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S (and day one on Game Pass), and PlayStation 5. </p>

            <p>Fallout 76 players will be able to turn themselves into Ghouls in early 2025, Bethesda announced during the Xbox Games Showcase this evening. It's a series first for the Fallout universe, and a move that's sure to make the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">millions of new players</a> who have started playing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-fallout-games">Fallout games</a> in the wake of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Fallout TV</a> show jump with irradiated joy.</p>
<p>You'll need to reach Level 50 before you  can become your <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-fans-are-creating-tv-show-inspired-mods-from-presets-to-sound-effects">own version of Walter Goggins' gun-slinging Ghoul</a> in Fallout 76, and there will be a specific questline to complete that kicks off the path toward your eventual transformation.</p>
<p>Bethesda's keeping the exact details of this quest close to its chest for now, but in a press briefing ahead of tonight's reveal, creative director Jonathan Rush told Eurogamer that turning into a Ghoul will have a significant impact on how you play the game going forward.</p>

<p>For example, your new appearance "could land [players] in trouble" with some of Appalachia's various faction groups, and NPCs will react to you differently than before. However, there will also be plenty of benefits to becoming a Ghoul. In addition to the existing Perk Cards you had as a human (which is how Fallout 76 handles its stat points and special abilities), Rush said there will also be "dozens of Ghoul-specific Perk Cards to use" on top of what you've already unlocked, which could end up making them quite versatile allies around the wasteland. Likewise, Ghouls will also have unique environmental benefits, such as being more resistant to radiation.</p>
<p>Rush hinted there will be more incentives to tempt players into becoming a Ghoul, though he wasn't ready to reveal what those are just yet. Instead, we'll have to wait until later in the year before we can find out more, he said, though curiously, the transformation won't be permanent. How one goes from human to Ghoul and back again, however, is another mystery that will be revealed later this year.</p>
<p>Until then, players will have plenty to sink their teeth into with Fallout 76, as there's another big update coming next week on June 12th.</p>
<p>The Skyline Valley update will expand the map of Appalachia for the first time since the game launched in 2018, adding the Shenandoah Valley region to the southern edge of the map's central Savage Divide region. It will also be home to several new story quests and activities, and I'll have more to share on this next week.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft's Fable reboot will launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in 2025, it was confirmed tonight in a new trailer. We previously hadn't been given a release window for the upcoming fantasy role-player, despite seeing it a year ago at the last Xbox Showcase. 
</p>
<p>
And, just like last year, Fable's latest trailer confirmed another legend of British comedy will be featured. Yes, Super Hans from Peep Show, AKA Matt King, is in the game and plays retired hero Humphrey, who looks set to be one of your allies. 
</p>
<p>
Last year's trailer accompanied IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade, if you recall.

<p>
Developed by a team housed at Forza Horizon developer Playground Games, Fable remains one of the most beloved Xbox franchises and one of the platform holder's most anticipated games. Alongside Perfect Dark and South of Midnight, 2025 is shaping up to be a strong year.

            <p>Max Caulfield is back! The time-bending protagonist of the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> is returning in a new entry in the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure. It’s out this October.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Revealed during tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase, Double Exposure is a completely new instalment in the Life is Strange series, following the first game, its direct sequel, prequel Before the Storm and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-true-colors">Life Is Strange: True Colors</a>.</p>
<p>Max appeared in the first game and Before the Storm, with only passing mentions in the sequel - which introduced brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz as the focus - and True Colors, which followed brand new hero Alex Chen. It’s not clear when Double Exposure takes place in relation to the other games in the series, with Max is visibly older - suggesting it’s set a good few years after.</p>
<p>Max seems to have retained her control over the flow of time in Double Exposure, which amps up her ability to rewind time with the new power to jump between two parallel timelines.</p>

<p>In one of those timelines, Max’s friend Sophie is found dead in the woods, while in the other she’s still alive; the game will see Max trying to work with Sophie in the alternate dimension to save her in Max’s original reality. So in other words: you’re trying to solve a murder-mystery by working with the murder victim to solve her murder before it happens. That’ll involve plenty of intrigue, as Max won’t know who she can trust - or who will trust her enough to help.</p>
<p>Double Exposure is being developed by current series stewards Deck Nine, who took over from original Life is Strange creators Dontnod after working on Before the Storm. The studio has since developed True Colours and revisited the first game and Before the Storm in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-remastered-collection">Remastered Collection</a>, but has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-devs-deck-nine-accused-of-crunch-sexism-and-abusive-behaviour-amid-allegedly-toxic-culture">also faced recent allegations of crunch, toxic working conditions and abusive behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the announcement of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, we also got a release date: it’ll be out on October 29th.</p>

            <p>I never played the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a>, but the trailer for the reboot shown during this evening's Xbox Games Showcase instantly made it the most exciting game I've seen during not-E3. It's first-person, it's got stealth, it's got parkour, it's got hand-to-hand melee combat including slidekicks. It looks like a mashup of Mirror's Edge and something more immersive sim-y? What's not to like.

<p>Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility. I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer not even a year.
</p>
<p>This new Perfect Dark was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-making-a-new-perfect-dark">announced back in 2020</a>, without much real information about the game at the time other than that it was being developed by a new Microsoft studio, The Initiative. Since then it's apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-in-early-development-and-years-from-release-report-claims">hit some development snags</a>, and external studio (and Tomb Raider reboot gang) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-reboot-studio-now-working-on-perfect-dark-reboot">Crystal Dynamics have come onboard as co-developers</a>. 
</p>
<p>I will wait however long I need to in order to shimmy down a drainpipe and slidekick some men in the shins.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age Of Mythology: Retold</a>, the remaster of the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> beast-em-up, is due to release this year, 4th September 2024 on PC and Game Pass. This will be the 2002 game’s second remaster following its Extended Addition re-release in 2014, and aims to thoroughly spiff up the original with a 3D visual overhaul, new animations and texture, plus UI and QOL improvements. Prevent yourself being seduced by the suspiciously thunder-imbued swan that’s currently chatting you up, and have a gander at the trailer below:</p>

<p>Describing itself as ‘an epic and innovative experience for old and new players alike’, Retold - like the original game - riffs on the classic Age of Empires series fundamentals with a diverse roster of monsters and creatures. The original release featured three factions: Greek, Egyptian and Norse. Subsequent expansions added Atlantean and Chinese forces, and Retold aims to bundle these additional bits together into a single package.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of Age Of Mythology, although slightly less fond memories of my dad telling me that "easy mode is basically a tutorial" when I finished the campaign before him. No need to get tilted there, dad. It’s fine to admit that my clicking skills have surpassed yours. If you fancy a lil’ deep dive into the updated systems - nothing Atlantean, but Swan-level at least - Edwin wrote about them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/age-of-mythology-retold-tilts-for-the-modern-esports-crowd-with-changed-god-power-mechanics">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> remake - aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> - resurfaced during tonight’s Xbox Games Showcase. We still don’t have a release date, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-and-metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-remakes-listed-for-2024-release">despite signs</a> we might see the remake of the 2004 game this year, but we did get a pretty good look at a bunch of key moments from the original remade in the shiny Unreal Engine 5 do-over - including a look at The Boss and the familiar gravelly tones of Snake actor David Hayter.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>MGS Delta was revealed last year with a very brief tease of its faithful polishing of the PlayStation 2 classic, which has so far only come to PC (officially) in the serviceable if fairly underwhelming Master Collection. We later got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-first-gameplay-shows-off-a-faithful-mgs3-remake-in-unreal-engine-5">a fuller look at some gameplay</a>, showing that, yes, this will indeed be a Metal Gear Solid game with all the sneaking, shooting, choking and wriggling around on the floor that implies.</p>
<p>The latest gameplay reveal gave a more action-packed taste than the fairly serene stealth slice of the latest trailer, showing Naked Snake blasting helicopters, wielding a rocket launcher in the sidecar of a motorcycle, CQC-ing guards to the floor, encountering the Ocelot Unit and interrogating soldiers while holding a knife to their throats. It was a surprisingly wide-ranging showcase, in my opinion, spanning from the opening HALO jump at the very start of the game through to the very late-game motorcycle chase.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTVaEPHa9Bc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>We also got a very brief glimpse at the game’s crocodile hat - I’m personally curious to see if the slightly clunky camouflage menus are streamlined in the remake - while Snake swam around in some swamps and crawled in mud.  One snippet showed Snake taking aim at some kind of elk-deer thing with twisty horns (what am I, a zoologist?) to prepare his next meal. I don’t remember seeing that specific animal in the original, so it might be new.</p>
<p>Maybe most excitingly - at least for me - we got to finally see Delta’s take on Snake’s mentor The Boss, showing the iconic confrontation on the rickety rope bridge from early in the game. The cutscene clips also gave us our first earful of returning Snake actor David Hayter, having been elbowed out in favour of Keifer Sutherland for Metal Gear Solid V.</p>
<p>It continues to look very, very nice - and very close to the original, albeit with much prettier graphics, as far as my memory serves. Still, with no sign of a release date yet, we don’t know how long we’ll be waiting to give a go for ourselves.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Xbox finally gave us a first peek at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the new first-person action-adventure under development at Wolfenstein developer under the watchful eye of producer Todd Howard. That first trailer certainly got tongues wagging, and delivered plenty of the puzzle solving and derring-do the series is known for, but, of course, fans wanted more.</p>
<p>Well, today at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we got a new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle trailer, which largely focuses on a scene set in the Himalayas. It looks like Great Circle has received a bit of a visual upgrade since its first trailer – facial animations in particular, which were somewhat criticized when the game was revealed, look better. Overall, the scene feels like it’s been plucked right from one of the movies, although it is rather long without any interactivity. Hopefully, there’s not too much of a focus on non-interactive cutscenes. That said, the trailer does end with plenty of shooting, fisticuffs, and other actual in-game action. You can check out the latest Indiana Jones and the Great Circle trailer for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Haven’t been keeping up with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle? Here’s how Bethesda previously described the game…</p>
<p><em>"Our game is about putting you in the shoes of an iconic hero. Since we are doing this mostly in first-person, you have the chance to truly become Indy. First-person makes you part of this world – allowing you to explore and experience things more intimately. What will you do when you’re dropped into this adventure with your wits and your whip? The world of Indiana Jones is a world with mysteries around every corner, where you’re racing against the clock and outsmarting your enemies as you hunt down artifacts.”</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on sometime in 2024. What do you think? Ready to don the ol’ fedora and get swinging again?</p>

			<p>Today, during the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Obsidian Entertainment did not announce the release date for Avowed, its first-person action RPG for PC and Xbox Series S|X, which remains slated for a generic 2024 window. However, at least we got a new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykgkdU1NJUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you might recall, the game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc-by-obsidian-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at the 2020 Showcase with a CGI teaser trailer highly reminiscent of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, which showed a darker art style and dual wielding of spells and weapons. Indeed, it looks like that was the original pitch made by Obsidian, but the project <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-has-had-a-reboot-of-sorts-and-may-be-further-away-than-anticipated-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went through a major reboot in 2021</a> that likely affected its release date.</p>
<p>The new Game Director, Carrie Patel, steered Avowed towards the studio's traditional strengths: strong characters and dialogue-based choices and consequences. However, the scope was reduced; <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-similar-to-kotor-2-outer-worlds-length-size-open-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is not an open world</a>, and its size has been likened to the studio's previous games Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic 2 and The Outer Worlds, which require around 30 to 40 hours to be completed instead of Skyrim's over 100.</p>
<p>Truth be told, a few days later after this news, another Obsidian developer wrote on a forum to <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-game-will-be-larger-than-the-outer-worlds-lighting-and-art-will-be-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarify</a> that Avowed would still be larger and more open than those two older games, speculating that the official information might have been shared in order to temper expectations of a massive Skyrim-like RPG.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Obsidian was given a spot on the Xbox Developer Direct, where fans could finally watch <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-first-gameplay-deep-dive-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several minutes of gameplay</a>. The combat system's flexibility was shown with players able to switch seamlessly between various weapon types and spells thanks to the customizable loadouts. The developers also provided an example of a quest where players will get the chance to decide the outcome in a major way.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Avowed is set in the world of Eora, previously introduced in the Pillars of Eternity games. The game will take place entirely on the remote island of the Living Lands. As an envoy of the Aedyr, the player character is sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague. Once there, players will discover a personal connection to the Living Lands and an ancient secret that threatens to destroy everything.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Game Showcase 2024, Blizzard showed the first cinematic trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-is-the-first-expansion-due-in-late-2024-will-add-brand-new-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a>. In it, Neyrelle clearly struggles with the Prime Evil she's carrying. We also got the release date for the expansion: October 8.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Vessel of Hatred | Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtM0WpHEjWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred will add a brand new class, the Spiritborn, allow you to recruit mercenaries to aid in combat, add a new PvE coop activity, and most of all, continue the story into the new region of Nahantu in search of Neyrelle, who is both suffering the fate of her choice to imprison the Prime Evil Mephisto and seeking a means to destroy him.</p>

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Perfect Dark will be added soon. </em></p>
<p>Xbox’s new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a> project has been one of the biggest outstanding questions this generation. In development for around six years at new “AAAA” studio The Initiative, with Crystal Dynamics pitching in to help since 2021, the new Perfect Dark has largely remained sequestered in the shadows, and we’ve received multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports the project is in a “rough state.”</a></p>
<p>Well, today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> we got a first look at the new Perfect Dark in action, and it seems like it’s actually coming together fairly well. Of course, this is likely just a small vertical slice of the game, and the full project could still have problems, but it seems like The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics at least laid down a foundation of what the game should be.</p>
<p>A first-person adventure, the Perfect Dark footage starts with some Hitman-esque stealth, followed by some Mirror’s Edge-style stealth. Finally, the footage culminates in some shooting, which looks too incorporate both the ability to take cover and use various gadgets, like tasers. Check out the Perfect Dark footage for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Perfect Dark is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S. A release window has not been specified. What do you think? Excited for the return of Joanna?</p>

  <p id="eD9JQB">The first expansion for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23739085/diablo-4-review-release-date-mmo-pc-open-world"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/11/8/23951306/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-class-blizzcon-2023"><em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a> will release on Oct. 8, 2024. Blizzard first revealed the upcoming expansion at the Xbox Games Showcase. Blizzard first announced the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23944179/diablo-4-expansion-vessel-hatred-reveal-trailer-class-blizzcon-2023">expansion back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, where we learned it would include a new region, new class, seasonal play, and more. </p>
<p id="9g51uN">The opening cinematic for the game teased a devious scenario where a floating crystal talks to a character named Neyrelle, who is on a quest to reach Akarat’s Tomb. However, all is not well with the adventurer. The short clip shows her being infected by the stone and ends up trapping her in a very fleshy cavern at the center of a giant demon. </p>
<p id="KjAPPQ">The story of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> picks up after the end of <em>Diablo 4</em>, and takes us to a new region in the south of Sanctuary known as Nahantu, or Torajan to outsiders. This landmass is thick with jungle, but still as dark and ominous as the rest of the regions players have seen so far. Players haven’t seen this region of the world since <em>Diablo 2</em>. If you haven’t completed the main campaign, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> will start with a recap and then let you play on from there.</p>

<p>You know, I genuinely didn’t think we would see anything about Assassin’s Creed Shadows during the Xbox Games Showcase. I assumed Ubisoft would wait until Ubisoft Forward, but I’m pleasantly surprised. The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay trailer gives us a firsthand look at how both the samurai and ninja playstyles work!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ve seen quite a bit about Assassin’s Creed Shadows to date, but mostly cinematics and teaser images. It’s nice to finally get a glimpse of genuine gameplay with a firsthand look at both Naoe and Yasuke—a samurai and ninja players will swap between during the campaign.</p>



<p>One is a brutal, in-your-face assault-like playstyle that lends itself to more action-packed gameplay approaches. The other, however, provides long-time fans with their stealth gaming itch, skulking through the shadows and dealing critical damage from behind.</p>

<p>We’ll likely see more at Ubisoft Forward, but this short gameplay trailer provides us with plenty to build the hype train before its upcoming release!</p>

<p>Atomfall has just been revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, with the developer unveiling a somewhat bizarre first-person shooter featuring mystical cults, the undead, threatening robots, and a World War II-themed setting. It looks curious at first blush, as the trailer doesn’t seem to reveal what the heck is going on.</p>

<p>In 2025, Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will drop on day one on Game Pass. That’s all well and good, but what <strong>is it</strong>?</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer – see if you can figure it out:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It looks entertaining enough – not much is known about Atomfall but it appears to be an open-world title that’ll boast some RPG elements and perhaps a little base building thrown in for good measure. It’s hard to gauge exactly what’s going on, but this is a first reveal – there’s time.</p>

<p>Ahead of the impending release of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, GSC Game World has published a fresh trailer, which first aired during the Xbox Games Showcase. Aside from a few tidbits in video and screenshot form, we’ve not seen much of STALKER 2 since the game was delayed out of 2023 and pushed into 2024. Following some sizeable leaks, fans became concerned about the stability of the project, but this latest trailer will help set minds at ease.</p>

<p>STALKER 2 has been in the works for over a decade, with some tough situations pushing the game’s development back repeatedly.

<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, GSC Game World released a tasty new trailer for prospective fans to sink their teeth into. We get a perfect look at the living, breathing world of Chornobyl, with GSC offering an extended glimpse behind the development curtain of what the finished product will look like in September.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>

<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Square Enix revealed a phenomenal trailer for Life is Strange: Double Exposure, officially announcing the return of Max Caulfield. As the protagonist of the original Life is Strange title, Max Caulfield was the first gifted character players assumed control of, picking up the ability to control time. From there, the Life is Strange franchise blossomed, and in this all-new adventure, Max is back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-coming-october-29">Coming October 29</h2>



<p>Max Caulfield returns to investigate the murder of her best friend (does that ring a bell?) in Double Exposure, but there’s a massive twist. She now has the ability to tear open portals between worlds, and in one, her friend is still alive and she has a chance to save her, in a way. </p>



<p>It looks as though Max has taken on multiple abilities since her adventures in Arcadia Bay, but it also looks like the split ending that players experienced at the end of the first game was ‘decided on’, as Chloe Price is nowhere to be found.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Double Exposure:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s coming October 29 on Xbox Series X|S and PC – it hasn’t been confirmed if it’ll be a one-shot title or episodic.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fragpunk: A New Hero Shooter Trying to Change The Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-a-new-hero-shooter-trying-to-change-the-rules.895686/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Fragpunk was just revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase, with Netease lifting the lid on a five-vs-five hero shooter that’s trying to ‘change the rules’ with an innovative card-based system. This multiplayer shooter is bursting at the seams with flashy visuals, unique mechanics, and an ever-changing battlefield, but are we all a little too tired of hero shooters at the moment?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of hero shooters to emerge in recent years, building on the popularity of titles like Overwatch and VALORANT. Fragpunk is a little different, though. In this game, players wield cards that act as power-ups, changing the face of battle and offering some fairly unique advantages, such as spawning dense foliage to hide in, swelling the heads of enemies, or employing Death in his ghastly form to strip the life from your opponents.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer – feel free to size up Fragpunk for yourself:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="FragPunk: Official World Premiere Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fN8EdlB0P10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks as though Fragpunk aims to fuse traditional ballistic weaponry with fantastical and otherworldly abilities, much like VALORANT does. The aesthetic event resembles that of Riot Games’ first-person shooter, which was released in 2020 to compete with the likes of Counter-Strike.</p>



<p>Fragpunk will release on Xbox and PC in 2025.</p>
