			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a> by Necrosoft Games made more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2024-great-months-ahead/">a few heads turn</a> when it was revealed in 2022, and for good reasons. Combining gorgeous old-school visuals with a unique atmosphere reminiscent of Italian horror movies and an evident classic Persona influence, the game looked like the one to keep track of for fans of the ATLUS series who prefer the classic first entry in the franchise as well as Persona 2 Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment.</p>
<p>Following two years of almost complete silence, which made people fear the worst, a Demonschool playable demo is available as part of this year's Steam Next Fest, giving players the chance to experience a week in the life of Faye, the final heir of a legendary family of demon hunters, as she attempts to uncover the mystery of an island university together with some friends, an island where demons have started appearing, and the boundary between worlds, started getting thinner and thinner. While the demo drops players a few hours into the adventure and lacks all of the mechanics that will be available in the final release, I feel it does a great job showcasing some of the most unique features of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240601124113_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The story of Demonschool is probably the hardest feature to evaluate from the demo. From what can be gleaned, Faye's investigation will go hand-in-hand with university life, and an occult theme seems to permeate everything. For example, the demo begins after Faye and her companions have successfully investigated some sort of possessed VHS tape and have been rewarded for it with school credits that can be used to learn new abilities. The week that can be experienced in the demo is centered around finding a demonic paintbrush, and during the investigation, the party will meet all sorts of wacky characters, such as an amnesiac woman who thinks random people are actually her husband who seems to be the main focus of a longer subquest. Thankfully, it seems like secondary quests will be hard to miss, as the quick travel interface highlights any important event that is about to take place in a certain location. Ultimately, the week available in the demo passes by rather quickly thanks to a gripping enough story that is possibly made more enjoyable by the game's beautiful and colorful 2D visuals and the atmospheric soundtrack that gives the experience a sort of horror-noir vibe. If the entirety of the story manages to do the same, it remains to be seen, but I'm definitely hopeful.</p>
<p>The real highlight of the Demonschool demo is the combat system, which is quite unique compared to most role-playing games on the market. After encountering an enemy, the party gets transported to a combat arena where both the player and the AI-controlled enemies take turns to move their units and take action. Actions play all together at the end of the Planning Phase, where the player can take all the time needed to move their units. A single unit can be moved and attack enemies as long as enough AP is available, though multiple actions from a single unit increase their AP cost.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240601124811_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, my in-game week in the Demonschool demo flew by, and it has definitely left me hungering for more, especially as the demo hints that there will be more to do than just fight demons and progress through the main adventure. Hopefully, the wait won't be much longer, and the game will indeed be released on PC and consoles in the second quarter of the year, as currently listed on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Steam Store page.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170739/sweet-tooth-netflix-pinkie-finger-shaking-machine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oOdKkc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22517814/sweet-tooth-review-netflix"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>, a loose adaptation of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22538573/sweet-tooth-comic-changes-creator-jeff-lemire-interview">Jeff Lemire’s comic series of the same name</a>, is an undersung treat of Netflix’s library. The post-apocalyptic coming-of-age quest mixes the dreamlike qualities of a fable with the factional drama of a <em>Walking Dead</em> story, in a world where all human children are born as animal hybrids and a deadly virus called the Sick whittles away at teens and adults. </p>
<p id="pvYcUe">But in filming for the final season of <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, premiering today, showrunner Jim Mickle says that if anything, his long-running actors were excited about the prospect of their characters contracting the Sick.</p>
<p id="RgXxRN">You know, because it meant they’d get to try out the pinkie-finger-wiggling machine. </p>
<p id="ZW24aD">In <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, the earliest symptom of the Sick is that the patient develops an uncontrollable twitch in their littlest fingers. It’s a great visual, a tiny detail that represents huge revelations. Characters conceal and reveal their hands depending on who they trust; other characters demand to see their hands before allowing them close. In <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, a money shot of a twitching pinkie finger can be a shocking twist. </p>
<p id="jI6uQm">But we wondered: Was shaking one’s pinkie finger in complete isolation to the rest of the hand difficult for the <em>Sweet Tooth</em> cast? </p>
<p id="6atlZZ">“Yes!” Mickle told Polygon over video chat. “But you could tell that they were excited, like, <em>I get to try</em> [the pinkie finger twitch]<em>!</em> They would always get kind of into it.”</p>
<p id="WnDZdj">Mickle’s goal for the finger shaking was to make it look like an involuntary movement. “You know sometimes your eyelid flutters, or something, you have a little movement? That was exactly what I wanted it to be: a weird, involuntary thing. [...] It has to be more than just you can do naturally or organically. It has to be a thing that feels like your body is reflexively doing that.” </p>
<p id="Ho8dFR">Achieving that effect unaided was not always easy, but for anyone who found it difficult, <em>Sweet Tooth</em>’s effects team developed a bespoke pinkie-wiggling machine using the spin of a laptop’s hard drive. “That was the motor,” Mickle said, “and they connected that, basically taped it to a wire that went up someone’s arm and they just animated the hard drive and it would actually [shake their finger].” </p>
<p id="DSc0iD">By season 3, the pinkie-wiggling machine had evolved to boast its own motor that would sit underneath the actor’s clothing on their back, “and it would run up a cable that would go on your [arm with a] bicycle brake cable, and we tape it to the pinkie.” </p>
<p id="8lHhF8">Still, the devices remained finicky and were prone to failing entirely if the actor bent their elbow. “We spent probably days of our lives on set just going, <em>OK, roll!</em> and you’d roll and be like, <em>OK, and pinkie!</em> and it would just...” Here Mickle raised his hand and twitched his pinkie a measly one time. “...do that and stop. And we would constantly do that.”</p>
<p id="I0rt7o">Despite the frustrations, Mickle said, the cast was gung-ho for the device. Without wanting to reveal too much, he did let on that with the Sick becoming a bigger threat, a number of characters “that we don’t think will ever die of that suddenly start shaking, and I think [the actors] really got into it, because they never thought they’d have to do it.” </p>

<p id="Dr5uMc"><em>12 Angry Men</em> hits just as hard now as it did back in 1957. A true pressure cooker of a film, this monochrome classic proves how much you can do with a cast of 12 dudes in a single room.</p>

Hell, if you finished the first <em>Destiny</em> campaign, it was pretty obvious that there really wasn’t much of a story, beyond references to wizards on moons and characters literally saying they didn’t have time to explain why they didn’t have time to explain.</p><figure id="" data-id="03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-recommend-id="image://03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-recommend-id="image://03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But I would still like to be able to play this solar-system-spanning adventure from beginning to end.

<p>Following the hunger for the genre after the release of Baldur’s Gate 3, we desperately need a big-name RPG to hit digital storefronts and sweep people off their feet. We might have that on the horizon with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but only time will tell. For now, will we see Dragon Age: The Veilguard at Summer Game Fest?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-to-summer-game-fest">Is Dragon Age The Veilguard Coming to Summer Game Fest?</h2>



<p>Previously, we heard about a Dragon Age: Dreadwolf <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-we-see-dragon-age-dreadwolf-at-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal in the </a>Summer of 2024, indicating a Summer Game Fest showing. However, with the recent name change to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we know for a fact that we’ll see a full reveal on June 11. That is, of course, following the conclusion of Summer Game Fest, which ends on June 10. It appears EA wants the spotlight to themselves, so they’re waiting until the show’s end.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases">Do We Know When Dragon Age The Veilguard Releases?</h2>



<p>While the title of the upcoming RPG may have changed, the release window has not shifted. We previously reported on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-reportedly-launch-by-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching by March 2025</a>. That’s still the most likely case, though we still have months to go.</p>



<p>Personally, I’m hoping for a fall or winter 2024 release, something I can play over an extended winter vacation. However, it appears early 2025 is the most likely timeframe we have!</p>

<p>Microsoft is reportedly in the early stages of developing another remaster of Halo: Combat Evolved and is considering releasing it on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s according to Tom Warren at The Verge, who received the website’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Notepad’ newsletter</a> (subscription required, but the first 30 days are free). </p>



<p>The report outlines other details surrounding the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase, including the fact that Microsoft is going to port other games under “Project Latitude”. However, according to Warren, Fable, Gears 6 and South of Midnight are currently not planned for porting. The new Doom game, which will be called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages will be</a>. </p>



<p>Halo: Combat Evolved has already been remastered once before as part of the Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. The remaster included the game being remade with 343 Industries’ in-house game engine and would include achievements, Terminals, and Skulls. The game was originally released in November 2011 and re-released as part of the Halo: The Master Chief Collection. </p>



<p>What do you think of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster coming to PlayStation 5? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

As such, the developer has had to quickly step in with fixes and the promise of some much-needed patches.</p> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DESTINY 2 MAINTENANCE<br>❖ Update 8.0.0.2</p><p>Maintenance has begun. Destiny 2 is being brought offline for expected maintenance.</p><p>REMAINING TIMELINE<br>❖ Downtime ends: 8 AM</p><p>More info: <a href="https://t.co/48Mjp1drx7">https://t.co/48Mjp1drx7</a></p></div>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1798697598381138332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">A recent post on Twitter/X from the Bungie Help account says that, as of now, <em>Destiny 2</em> servers have been “brought offline for expected maintenance.” This period is expected to last until 8AM PDT, but you can keep an eye on things via the Twitter account and/or the <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049199271-Destiny-Server-and-Update-Status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server status page</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-seems-to-be-good-otherwise" data-injectable="false">Seems to be good, otherwise</h2> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">After the debacle that was <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s poor connectivity and general server issues, fans immediately took to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336880/Destiny_2_The_Final_Shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> to register their complaints, where the DLC was downvoted to “Mostly Negative.”</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Fortunately, some mends and quick fixes were implemented and things seem to be only getting better. In fact, at the time of writing, the expansion is now at “mixed” and a lot of recent feedback shows that it could well be one of the best DLCs <em>Destiny 2</em> has had.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="false">However, there’s that lingering metaphorical fart in the air once more, as we find ourselves enmeshed in the ongoing backlash against studios and publishers that are putting out content that’s clearly not fit for consumption. Sure, the developer is on the case – which is typically how these things go – but it’s a concern that day launch in this state to begin with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/monoliths-wonder-woman-game-is-reportedly-troubled/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=monoliths-wonder-woman-game-is-reportedly-troubled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Wonder Woman</em> game in development at Monolith Productions is reportedly “going through a “troubled” phase. The claim comes from Kinda Funny Gamescast host Greg Miller, who also adds that he is not holding hope for the game to be showcased at the upcoming Summer Game Fest.</p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Here’s Miller’s complete quote from the podcast: “Here you go, you want it? You want the exclusive? I’ll give you my ‘Jeff Grubb’ information. In the past year – cause I’ll leave it ambiguous – I have talked to an insider, who was like, ‘This game’s troubled.’ That’s it, that’s all I’ll say. So I don’t hold out hope that it’s in a place to show something.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Summer Game Fest 2024 Predictions - Kinda Funny Gamescast" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kJQjUgT_QY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, the studio has announced it is <a href="https://x.com/MonolithDev/status/1798401921465921768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">looking for a lead gameplay engineer</a>, and the announcement comes days after Miller’s comment during the podcast. While hiring for roles is not that big of a deal, the lead role hiring does raise eyebrows. Given that Monolith has been working on the title since 2021, it may take some more time before we learn more about this game.</p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">It remains to be seen if <em>Wonder Woman</em> will be showcased at the Summer Game Fest or not, but it sounds like all signs point towards its absence at this year’s SGF.</p> <figure data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Wonder Woman - Official Game Announcement Teaser" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyA8lnp9Tzg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Back when the game was announced, Monolith Productions had released a short, cinematic trailer, which offered a first look at <em>Wonder Woman</em>. It was also revealed in 2021 that the game will be a single-player title with an open world, and will carry an original story in the DC Universe.</p>

<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Jeremy Renner, who played William Brandt in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies, has now revealed why he turned down the opportunity to return to the franchise. Renner was offered a role in <em>Mission: Impossible – Fallout</em> but bowed out because he did not agree with the direction his character in the film was heading towards.</p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Renner was recently on the Happy, Sad, Confused Podcast where he was asked to explain why Brandt was missing in <em>Mission: Impossible – Fallout</em>, which came out back in 2018. He said that he declined to return because his character was going to be killed off in the movie.</p> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">“If you’re going to do this, and you’re going to use my character, you’re going to do it right,” he said.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The actor further explained, “I remember they tried to bring me over[seas] for a week so they could kill my character, and I was like, ‘No, you don’t get to do that. You’re not going to drag me over there and just kill my character,’ like get out of here!”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Jeremy Renner talks accident, AVENGERS return, MAYOR OF KINGSTOWN I Happy Sad Confused" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cn5a57rH2XI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Renner said he yelled at the director, telling him, “Dude, you’re not going to do this to me like that; you’re not going to do me wrong.”</p>
 <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false">The actor also revealed that he had left the franchise because he wanted to focus on his responsibilities as a father, and it was hard to spend time with the family since the filming took place overseas.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="false">While this sounds like Renner is not going to make a return to the franchise, all hope is not lost. He said during the podcast that he is open to returning as William Brandt. However, it is clear that the role must have significance for Renner to consider it.</p>

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> brought with it a brand new raid for players to prepare for and race in just three days later. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salvation’s Edge</a> sees Guardians confront The Witness, possibly the toughest monster the universe has ever seen, but only one fireteam can finish it first. </p> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Every time a new raid is added to <em>Destiny 2</em>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/power-level-requirements-to-raid-destiny-2-the-final-shape-salvations-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players prepare themselves</a> and their fireteams to take part in the race to finish it before anyone else. For the first 48 hours that Salvation’s Edge is live, it’ll be on Contest Mode, meaning Bungie is actively tracking those playing it to see who finishes it first. Content creators and hardcore fans alike will be getting in on this one because <em>The Final Shape</em> is the last major expansion for the game. </p>

However, a few content creators always jump into the race when a new raid drops, so I’ve included links to their channels below so you can see what they’re up to and how far into the raid they are when the race begins. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">BobDuckNWeave</h3> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">BobDuckNWeave is a talented streamer who has accepted the challenge to tackle the race for world first in Salvation’s Edge.

 <h3 data-injectable="false">Datto</h3> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">Datto is well-known in the <em>Destiny 2 </em>community and is one of the most wholesome content creators in the space.

 <h3 data-injectable="false">King Gothalion</h3> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">King Gothalion is another name synonymous with <em>Destiny 2</em>.

 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Note that this isn’t a comprehensive list of every competing team.

As soon as it does, I’ll update this section of the article with the team that is furthest ahead of all the others. I expect this to be quite a close race, so the team in first could change frequently. </p>

<p data-characters="468" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new season of <em>Destiny 2</em> means a lot of different things. Outside of all the new season-related content (known now as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-power-works-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Episode Acts</a>), much of the content from the previous season is now permanently gone. There may be the odd vendor to spend your old resources, but that’s as far as it goes. With that in mind, you might be wondering if you can claim the rewards you may have forgotten to snag. Here’s whether you can claim past season rewards in <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-get-rewards-from-previous-seasons-in-destiny-2" data-injectable="false">Can you get rewards from previous seasons in Destiny 2?</h2> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">You can still get rewards from previous seasons in Destiny 2. If you want to claim the rewards you’ve earned from the last season (at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-destiny-2s-constellation-wish-quest-for-a-wish-keeper-exotic-catalyst/">Season of the Wish</a>) this can be done by navigating through <strong>the official Companion app</strong>. It’s available for download on any Android or iOS phone from the Play Store or App Store respectively. If you’re talking about seasons before then, it’s almost impossible to get their rewards.</p>
 <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="false">There have been mentions of a Google Chrome or Firefox extension called Season Pass Pass that did let you claim these rewards, but details on it have been muddy over the years. As of June 2024, it appears that the extension <strong>either doesn’t work, or may be limited</strong> in how many seasons you can go back. You could also try contacting Bungie to see what they could do on their end, but it’s unlikely much can be done. If you want the rewards from the current Episode Act, you should claim them as soon as you get them rather than sitting on them until the last minute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-keighley-hype<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>E3 is officially dead, which means Geoff Keighley has won in his quest to supplant it and now gets to slap his branding on its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-life-and-death-of-e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corpse</a>. He’s been cranking the Summer Game Fest hype engine for weeks now, only to tell us on Monday that we shouldn’t get <em>too</em> hyped. Weirdly, he does this a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>On a Twitch stream this week, Keighley <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Friday’s Summer Game Fest show will focus on “existing games that have new updates” and that, while there will be announcements, “this is not a show that has a lot of like ‘coming in 2026' or ‘2027', or teasers for games that are years and years out.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not the kind of thing you expect to hear from a man who seems intent on holding the copyright for the phrase “world premiere,” a man who looks both animated by and exhausted from hype about hype. He’s been <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> about the show for weeks, announcing partners and counting down the days. This semi-reversal has felt so notable that it’s spawned a universe of headlines about “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-what-we-know-wont-be-at-summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we know won’t be</a>” at the show and “<a href="https://en.as.com/meristation/news/what-not-to-expect-at-summer-game-fest-live-according-to-geoff-keighley-n/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what not to expect</a>,” alongside exhortations that we “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-big-reveals-at-summer-games-fest-says-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t expect big reveals</a>” and “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/summer-game-fest-will-focus-on-existing-games-so-dont-hyper-yourself-up-for-games-that-are-years-and-years-out-says-geoff-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t hype yourself up</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>But a similar thing happened around Summer Game Fest 2022, when Keighley <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-showcase-geoff-keighley-expectations-141656607.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a Twitter Spaces chat</a> a few days ahead of the show that “it definitely is a show that’s primarily focused on stuff that is announced” and warned viewers to "definitely manage your expectations in terms of the megaton shocks that you’re expecting." Previously, Keighley had hyped that show up all the way to <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1522237966902460417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMAX screens</a>, and told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/05/20/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> that “June is definitely a good time for people to ramp up, get people excited about things coming in the future.”&nbsp;</p><p>The next year, he burst his own hype bubble around <a href="https://gamerant.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-reveals-world-premieres-geoff-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> 2023, telling <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/geoff-keighley-says-this-years-gamescom-onl-is-less-about-announcing-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Video Game Chronicle</a>, “This year's ONL is less about announcing brand-new projects, and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games due out over the next year.” This was after <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1690832310411964416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hype trailers</a> and teasers about <a href="https://x.com/gamescom/status/1686025743422119936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world premieres</a>, and stood in contrast to ONL 2022, which he touted as a “<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/geoff-keighley-says-gamescom-opening-night-live-will-be-a-big-spectacle-3288878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big spectacle</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What do you want from us, Geoff? Keighley's whole deal is setting viewer expectations sky-high, turning advertisements into news and <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-winded speeches by his friends</a> into a required-viewing awards show. He's skilled in finding ways to appear excited about whatever is put in front of him, an orientation toward the world that seems like it must be very comforting--asked to select from the smorgasbord of human emotions, I too would choose endless enthusiasm if I could--and which has forged him a <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2022/12/8/23498936/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-video-games-oscars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-running</a> and <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-profile</a> career. But part of that schtick is getting us to be as excited as he is, or at least as he portrays himself as--and then telling us <em>not</em> to get excited at the last minute.&nbsp;<em>You're</em> the one who's doing this, buddy! You're the one who keeps having to correct the expectations <em>you</em> set us up for!</p><p>Covid’s effect on game development and the layoffs chewing their way through the industry have made reveal shows weird for a while now. It’s not Keighley’s fault that it’s harder to coordinate everyone having new stuff to show at the same time than it used to be. But it <em>is</em> his fault for continuously <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to make Fetch happen</a>, pretending that everything is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23992402/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business as usual</a> and that the only emotion <a href="https://videogames.si.com/features/games-industry-deserves-better-than-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth having</a> about video games these days is excitement. He’s inflicting all this on us, but he’s also doing it to himself, shovelling coal into his own hype train and then dodging before it hits him.&nbsp;</p><p>E3 saw the way the winds were blowing and bowed out. I think there’s some value, or at least some pleasure to be had, in doing <em>something </em>in its absence. If Keighley is determined to corner the market on that, ditching his role as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI_Oe-jtgdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harold Hill</a> of video game hype and just being <em>normal</em> could do him, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/only-you-can-prevent-the-game-awards-hype-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of us</a>, a favor.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Shenmue fans have rented out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game and give creator Yu Suzuki a chance to "complete his life's work".
</p>
<p>
The campaign has been spearheaded by fansite Shenmue Dojo, who shared a livestream clip of the #LetsGetShenmue4 billboard on social media.
</p>
<p>
The advertisement itself features artwork of key characters from the game with the hashtag, stating "join us the 4th of every month".

"Shenmue fans do some insane things to try and get recognised... are you watching Sega?" reads the social post from Shenmue Dojo. Plenty of other fan accounts have also shared images of the billboard as part of the campaign.

It's no surprise that fans are passionate enough for another sequel. The first two games, originally released on Sega's Dreamcast, were cult favourites that underperformed commercially. Creator Yu Suzuki turned to crowdfunding for the third game, raising a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-dev-declares-usd7-1m-crowdfunding-total">total of $7.1m from 81,087 backers</a>. On Kickstarter, it raised $6.3m to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-breaks-kickstarter-funding-record">the platform's highest-funded video game project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shenmue 3 ends on yet another cliffhanger, but there's no indication another game will be on the way, leaving fans frustrated.
</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Shenmue Dojo co-owners James Brown and Matt Oliver has discussed why this campaign is so important to fans, and why game is so special.</p>
<p>"What Shenmue did was not only change the perception of what could be done with video games back in 1999, it created a world and story that resonated deeply with us and the community but was a victim of circumstance (and other factors) with the discontinuation of the Dreamcast," they said.</p>
<p>"Shenmue is currently an unfinished story with Shenmue 3 ending on a cliffhanger following its 2019 release. Yu Suzuki has an overarching 11 chapter storyline which is currently around 40 percent completed. He feels that he could condense the next remaining chapters/story into two games to give a fulfilling conclusion. </p>
<p>"So our goal is to push for the fourth game in the series to be one step closer to the finished vision. For us it is not only important to be able to have Ryo's journey finally completed or to get ourselves lost in a new Shenmue game but to also support Yu Suzuki, who has given so much to gaming as a whole, a chance to finish his life's work."</p>
<p>The billboard idea originated from a stream a few months back, and is designed to be a statement to "really announce to the world that we're still here and will continue to unite and fight for Shenmue to be finished", the pair continued. The hope is it will resonate with Sega or other companies, and show the "crazy gestures" the series' community is still capable of. </p>
<p>The campaign cost just $40 for 15 seconds, with a timeslot suitable for the game's worldwide community. "However none of us could have predicted the huge reaction this has generated," they said, "and we thank each and every person who has posted this, talked about this and come out in force to support Shenmue". </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-creator-has-considered-yakuza-0-style-prequel-to-continue-series">Suzuki has discussed the possibility of a fourth game</a>, stating in an interview: "I want Shenmue 4 to be enjoyable for newcomers... To make that possible, the most important thing is to make it enjoyable without knowing previous events in the story. I don't think that a new player wants to know 100 percent of the story. 20 or 30 percent could be enough."

</p>
<p>
One consideration would be a prequel, as with Yakuza 0. "Making an even more detailed Dobuita than the original Shenmue is an interesting idea, especially if it's not a remake but a prequel with a new story," Suzuki said.
</p>
<p>
There's no indication that Shenmue 4 is even in development, but that hasn't stopped the desire from fans.
</p>
<p>
Shenmue 3 is "a faithful follow-up to an all-time classic," Martin Robinson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>. The game continues the story of teen martial artist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father, which began in the first game that impressed with its open world gameplay.

  <p id="JeqZ44"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/20/21264857/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-hunger-games-prequel-suzanne-collins-review">Suzanne Collins</a> is writing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">a new Hunger Games book</a> — and congrats everyone, it’s the Haymitch prequel story many (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025446/polygons-best-ships-2023-fanfic-legend-of-zelda-genshin-impact-baldurs-gate-3">myself included</a>) have been clamoring for. And in a surprise to no one, it’s becoming a movie, too.</p>
<p id="8NXU5E">Everyone say thank you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review"><em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em></a> star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23971450/hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-casting-rachel-zegler-tom-blyth">Rachel Zegler</a> for manifesting this back in 2021. </p>

<p id="TVRYMb">Titled <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, Collins’ new book takes place 24 years before the first Hunger Games book — on the dawn of the Second Quarter Quell. If you’re not super plugged into the Hunger Games timeline, that’s the game that Katniss and Peeta’s grumpy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the movies) won, by outsmarting the Gamemakers. </p>
<p id="Z53BYJ">A new Hunger Games book right after the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23987856/hunger-games-new-movie-ballad-songbirds-snakes-box-office-marvel-sequels-delay">box office success</a> of Hunger Games prequel movie might seem like a cash grab, but as longtime Hunger Games movie producer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23848083/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-release-cast-preview">Nina Jacobson told Polygon</a> last year, Collins is selective about when she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23959046/hunger-games-new-movie-fandom-songbirds-snakes">returns to this world</a>. </p>
<p id="bIlGNz">“Suzanne, the originator and North Star of everything that we try to do with these books, she doesn’t write just to make money,” Jacobson said. “She writes when she has something to say.”</p>
<p id="cxLVgf">And boy, does <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">Collins have something to say</a> this time! </p>
<p id="T8HCC6"><em>“</em>With <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” Collins said in a press release from Scholastic. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.”</p>
<p id="vSckjR">Jacobson promised that the only way she would make another Hunger Games movie is if Collins delivered new source material — and she is standing by her word. On the heels of the novel announcement, Lionsgate announced that it was already in the works on a movie version of <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>. Francis Lawrence, who directed several Hunger Games films including <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, is in talks to direct. Haymitch’s backstory was cut from the main Hunger Games films in order to streamline them, so this should be a perfect chance to finally showcase the whole story.</p>
<p id="SazaeW"><em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> arrives to bookstores on March 18, 2025. <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> will hit theaters on Nov. 20, 2026.</p>
<p id="LPi5dU"><strong>Update: </strong>After publication of this article, Lionsgate announced plans for a feature adaptation. We’ve updated the story to reflect both announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170271/commander-zavala-final-shape-keith-david-lance-reddick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lccEVt">Commander Zavala has always been my favorite Destiny character. He’s a dogmatic Paladin whose fervent devotion to his beliefs makes him a rock for his allies — my favorite archetype. And, most importantly, he was voiced by Lance Reddick, an actor I’ve loved since I first saw <em>The Wire</em> in college. </p>
<p id="TMj2kK">When Reddick unexpectedly passed away last year, Guardians like myself <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645175/destiny-fans-lance-reddick-bungie-tributes-tower">set up a kind of vigil by Zavala in the Tower</a>, standing watch in memory of our fallen commander. I cried then, and I’ve cried multiple times writing this piece. It was a devastating loss for the entire Destiny community, not only because Lance was an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929725/lance-reddick-destiny-2-witch-queen-commander-zavala-interview-bungie">avid enjoyer</a> of the game, but because Zavala’s story wasn’t finished yet. With this first Destiny saga so close to the end, how could Bungie ever hope to resolve Zavala’s arc without the man behind the voice?</p>
<p id="6fS0YH">Thankfully, it’s a challenge Destiny’s writers seem to have taken in stride, and one his replacement — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23827367/bungie-destiny-2-zavala-voice-actor-keith-david-lance-reddick">the legendary Keith David</a> — took to heart. The narrative team could’ve just written Zavala out of the story and left his decade-long arc in the dust, but instead, they did what they could given the situation and used our collective loss as a storytelling device.</p>

<p id="ZtVxgp">Since Guardians started toying with the Darkness in <em>Beyond Light</em>, Bungie has slowly been moving Commander Zavala down what I’d call a “crisis of faith” storyline, which is often a critical fork in the road for dogmatic characters in fiction. As Guardians began to move toward the Darkness, Zavala pushed back, diving further into his belief in the Light. He ultimately grew cynical over The Traveler’s silence.</p>
<p id="Ddn2OS">Every step Zavala has taken over the past four years has eroded him. And while he’s spent this entire time standing tall like he always does, he’s weaker on the inside than he seems. So when Zavala finally gets the chance to venture into The Traveler itself and evict The Witness alongside Ikora, Cayde, and the Guardian in <em>The Final Shape</em>, he begins to crumble when The Witness strikes at that weakness.</p>
<p id="5OgWJe">This shift is acted brilliantly by Keith David, who starts the expansion by emulating Reddick before fully taking hold of the character and twisting it into his own. Reddick had a stern kindness to his voice that has served Zavala perfectly for a decade. David has a similarly deep and calming voice, but he is also using his abilities as an actor to add in a sense of hidden malice, which he starts to draw out as the expansion goes on.</p>
<p id="CJOQrz">This change really starts to come into focus when Zavala sends you on a Strike mission in The Pale Heart to hunt down a Tormentor in a cave full of Ahamkara skulls. The commander starts off sounding frustrated, and he pushes you to enact vengeance on the creature. Beyond that, he suggests you take risks by harnessing the magic of these long-dead wish-dragons for your benefit. When it works, he acts as if there was never a chance that it wouldn’t.</p>

<p id="2LKJnD">In other words, Zavala begins to behave recklessly here, and Ikora calls him out for not only endangering the Guardian needlessly, but acting unlike himself. Instead of what would typically be a measured response from Zavala, he sasses Ikora for lecturing him. And when she pushes back again, he yells at her over the comms with a speech along the lines of, “Isn’t this what you always wanted from me?”</p>
<p id="oacmWW">These moments feel antithetical to Zavala as we’ve known him, and if the writing or performance were bad, it would probably feel like the character had just changed for no reason. But Bungie’s writers and Reddick had already been putting in the work toward a broken Zavala for years, so David is able to take that history and sell these moments. I didn’t feel like a new voice actor was changing my favorite character, I felt like I was watching a friend who had gone through an immense amount of trauma finally unraveling before my eyes — something I’ve unfortunately witnessed in my own life.</p>
<p id="ndzc7p">There’s a clear separation between the Zavala we’ve known and the Zavala we’re getting in <em>The Final Shape</em>. I realized for the first time during the Strike how truly different David and Reddick sound from one another, and it’s intentionally unsettling. It made me yearn for the old Zavala and Reddick — something I’ll never have again — and that hurt, in the way that the best kinds of art can hurt.</p>

<p id="AwLxsL">For Zavala, <em>The Final Shape</em>’s campaign acts as a kind of chrysalis and metamorphosis. Bungie’s writers deftly maneuver between Zavala experiencing rapid character growth and acting <em>out </em>of character. David enhances that writing beyond itself — as only great actors can do — with a masterful performance, offering us a Zavala who’s drowning without ever letting the man we know dip beneath the waves for too long. </p>
<p id="oj0hFw">It’s a risky move from both parties that I’m willing to bet won’t work for everyone. But as someone who originally couldn’t imagine anyone else stepping into Zavala’s shoes, I was blown away by how David and the writing team at Bungie were able to honor Reddick and his original performance.</p>
<p id="DuJBjA">Even so, it’s impossible not to feel deep sadness that Lance Reddick wasn’t able to be part of <em>The Final Shape</em> after years of being one of Destiny’s most famous characters and beloved community members. And there’s no doubt in my mind that he would’ve crushed this performance, just as he crushed all the others. But I think it’s beautiful how the writers and Keith David were able to make the most out of a terrible situation, and to give Zavala some of the best story moments in the series during <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>
<p id="WMy2VL">Rest in peace, commander — Zavala is in good hands. </p>

Those considered “earned editorial placements” are played for free, and are likely reserved for big reveals from massive companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-being-renamed-with-gameplay-reveal-set-for-june-11-exclusive.891465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The next Dragon Age is set to get its first big gameplay reveal on June 11, and when it does, it will be with a new name. IGN can exclusively reveal that the latest entry in the Dragon Age franchise, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-title-logo-revealed">previously known as Dragon Age Dreadwolf</a>, is being renamed Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p>The news comes with a host of details that shed new light on BioWare’s anticipated RPG, which up until this point has been kept heavily under wraps. Among other things, BioWare confirmed that The Veilguard will feature seven playable party members, and that it will feature “fun and fluid, moment-to-moment combat” while continuing to center strategy via the unique powers of each companion.</p><p>But it’s the name change that will do the most to raise eyebrows among the fandom. Ever since the conclusion of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC</a>, fans have expected a story focused on Solas, the  former companion who was revealed to be the Elven god Fen’Harel, also known as the Dread Wolf. BioWare general manager Gary McKay explains that while Solas is “still very much a part of the story of Dragon Age: The Veilguard,” the team wanted a title that reflected a “really deep and compelling group of companions.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/04/dreadwolfignthumb-1670174168362.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age's new name will seek to center its party members rather than Solas, one of the story's villains.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every Dragon Age game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay tells IGN. “We can’t wait for players to meet, connect and form their own personal relationships with the unique companions that make up The Veilguard. That’s the spirit of this game…of this story. Choosing who will join you on your adventure, fight alongside you, and be there by your side in the end.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate blog post</a>, McKay elaborated, “Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.”</p><p>McKay claims that the name change wasn’t a matter of focus testing, which commonly informs decisions like these. He even goes so far as to admit that sticking with Dreadwolf might have been easier.</p><p>“We actually think sticking with Dreadolf would have been the safer choice – ‘Dread Wolf’ is a cool name after all!” McKay says. “In the end, it was most important for us to have a title that was authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure we’ve created. We’ve worked throughout development to create really incredible backstories for each companion that intersect with the main narrative in meaningful ways.”</p><p>As for why it’s not simply named “Dragon Age IV,” McKay says it’s for the same reason that Dragon Age Inquisition wasn’t called “Dragon Age III: Inquisition.”</p><p>“Every game in the series tells its own unique story and the title is an important element to help set the stage for the next standalone adventure inclusive of its own hero, companions, narrative arc, villain, setting, etc,” he says.</p><h2><strong>The highest-stakes release in BioWare’s history?</strong></h2><p>The name change is the beginning of what is shaping up to be possibly the highest-stakes release in BioWare’s history. It’s been a full decade since Dragon Age: Inquisition – <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-inquisition-is-igns-game-of-the-year-2014"><u>which we we named our Game of the Year in 2014</u></a> – and since then the storied RPG studio has been battered by the disastrous release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">Anthem</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">layoffs</a>, and other setbacks, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-part-1-mass-effect">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> being one of its few bright spots. The Veilguard has been in various stages of development during this time, even reportedly being canceled at one point, though McKay frames it as a period of exploration in his blog post.</p><p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like,” McKay writes. “We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - Official Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Asked what it means for BioWare to finally be able to show The Veilguard to the world, McKay said, “As the studio head and executive producer, it’s been incredible to see the journey, resilience and passion that this team continues to bring every day. We have an incredible group of both BioWare and Dragon Age veterans who have been with us for years, as well as new faces and voices that love the series who have helped to create an unforgettable experience we feel will be worthy of the Dragon Age name.”</p><p>So who exactly are the Veilguard? In the lore, the Veil is a barrier between the physical world and Fade, which is Dragon Age’s spirit realm. Solas, who helped create the Veil, now wants to destroy it. Hence, as McKay puts it, “the Veil needs guarding.”</p><p>While acknowledging that the why and the how is definitely spoiler territory, McKay says, “The biggest clue I can share is that you and your companions – that make up The Veilguard – are central to taking down a new evil threat unleashed upon Thedas. It might not just be Solas.”</p><p>McKay isn’t quite ready to reveal the party members quite yet, but does provide some hints on what to expect, including some initial info on romances.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful. We’ve tapped into Dragon Age’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life,” he says. </p><p>“I won’t spoil next week’s reveal but I can say we’ve created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you. Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[Y]ou and your companions...are central to taking down a new evil threat unleashed upon Thedas. It might not just be Solas</p></div><p>McKay says the decision to pare the number of companions from nine to seven is mostly down to it being the “right number for the story we’re telling.” Each one is intended to represent a unique faction or element from Thedas, and will feature their own arc with “stories of love and loss, each with meaningful choices and emotional moments.”</p><p>He continues, “As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you’ll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before it.”</p><p>McKay mostly sidesteps questions of how Inquisition’s characters might fit into The Veilguard’s story, though he does confirm that it will once again feature an original protagonist similar to The Warden, Hawke, and The Inquisitor, noting that each Dragon Game has its own standalone story with its own thread and conflict.</p><p>“Games across the Dragon Age franchise are never designed as a game-over-game continuous storyline. There are familiar arcs, factions and heroes important to the overarching Dragon Age universe that weave through the new story we’re telling,” he explains. “The previous games, characters and events aren’t the anchor of Dragon Age: The Veilguard it’s about your adventure with a brand new cast of companions that you must rally to fight against a powerful force.” </p><p>He once again teases another villain beyond Solas: “I don’t want to get too deep into spoiler territory but I can say that the Dread Wolf is not the only god players need to be worried about.”</p><h2><strong>BioWare hints at what to expect from The Veilguard’s gameplay</strong></h2><p>When The Veilguard is finally revealed on June 11, BioWare’s presentation will include 15 minutes of gameplay from the opening moments of the game, which will help set up the story. On the gameplay front, McKay says that The Veilguard’s combat was a “big area of focus” and something the team wanted to push forward. Among other things, McKay says that The Veilguard will feature an ability wheel designed to give players more direct control over their characters.</p><p>“As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand,” he says. “To add another layer to that strategic element, we’re introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it’s your companions’ abilities or your own. </p><p>“The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions that can quickly turn the tide of any battle. We think we’ve found an exciting balance between fun, fluidity and strategy for every encounter.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>It all points toward a game that seems likely to please longtime fans of the series who have been waiting anxiously for a new entry over the last 10 years – and it’ll need to be. BioWare won’t say it directly, but everyone seems aware that a lot is riding on Dragon Age. Its reception will say a lot about whether BioWare is able to reestablish itself as a top-tier RPG studio alongside Larian, CD Projekt Red, and other recent success stories.</p><p>“This is a game and experience that continues BioWare’s tradition of single player RPG storytelling set in the epic fantasy world of Thedas,” McKay says. “We know Dragon Age fans and the community have been waiting a long time for the next game and we could not be more excited to share our gameplay reveal on June 11."</p><p>Make sure to stay tuned to IGN for more Dragon Age info, as well as lots more from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a>, and more. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Dragon Age: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's every release in the acclaimed RPG series past and future.</p></div><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Firewalk Studios says the game will receive frequent updates, adding content to keep things fresh and allow it to grow over the years. It certainly boasts intriguing visuals, and its characters include play styles for brute force, long-range snipers, and everything in between, so it'll be interesting to see how it's received when it drops on August 23.</p><p>Ahead of its release, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Concord-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D5S3WPW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Concord preorders</a> are now open. There's a good reason to reserve a copy too, as you'll get access to the beta running in July. You'll even find a digital deluxe edition that's loaded with in-game goodies. Here's a look at Concord preorders and what comes with each edition.</p><h2>Concord Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Preordering Concord will get you the Monarch Pack, which includes access to the beta test in July. Not only will <em>you</em> get access to the beta, but you'll get three additional codes to share with friends. The Monarch Pack also comes with a few weapon cosmetics.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frozen District and PlayWay have announced a&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update that's bringing some much-needed improvements to the game's Story Mode, as well as a, erm, "crossover" with a world-famous fairytale.</p>

<p>In a press release, Frozen District says the new update will allow you to renovate Little Red Riding Hood's grandma's house, which has been "left in shambles after encountering the Big Bad Wolf".</p>

<p>As such, you'll have to clean up the aftermath of the wolf's rampage, including "claw marks" and "fur remnants", as well as pawprints in the bedroom. You'll also need to work with "retro appliances" and a small elderly-friendly bathroom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update-before-after.jpg?itok=gOFC6S8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/house-flipper-2-fairytale-update-before-after.jpg?itok=l1rhZ7VX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>has a fairytale cottage for you to renovate in its latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the aforementioned fairytale renovation, this latest&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update also adds a new Before-After mechanic, which allows you to view before and after pictures of your renovation side-by-side.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>update without new items, and there are a whopping 190 to discover, including new wood materials, "charming cat-patterned wallpapers", and much more.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to gameplay improvements like simplified repairs, better HUD hiding, and "enhanced lamp style copying", which sounds like a feature pretty much any game could benefit from.</p>




<p><em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to&nbsp;<em>House Flipper</em>, a house renovation sim in which you must take crumbling properties and transform them into beautiful places in which people would actually want to live.</p>

<p>If you're not in the mood for taking on challenges, you can always enjoy things at your own pace in Sandbox Mode, which essentially allows you to build your dream home at your own pace.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190970/House_Flipper_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now on PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last six months have been turbulent for Xbox. Microsoft started the year by laying off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees</a>, then announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">four in-house games</a> would drop their exclusivity and ship on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. More recently, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down three game studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks, maker of the award-winning and widely praised <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p><p>The moves have rattled fans. Hardcore Xbox customers are upset that exclusives are available on rival consoles, with many wondering why they should continue to invest in the Xbox ecosystem when Microsoft is shutting down studios and its games are appearing on rival platforms anyway. Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase is a chance for Microsoft to try and get fans excited about the future again. I’m expecting two big game reveals, a lot of release dates, and some surprises along the way.</p><p>At the heart of all the turmoil leading up to this Xbox showcase are strategy shifts for both hardware and first-party games. Microsoft has promised a big technical leap for its next-gen Xbox, and the company is rumored to be working on an Xbox handheld. But there’s an ongoing project to bring more games to rival consoles like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch that could undermine both hardware efforts.</p><p>The plan that’s proven so controversial with hardcore Xbox fans is known internally as “Project Latitude,” sources familiar with Microsoft’s efforts tell me. Project Latitude started off with an initial wave of games, including <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Grounded</em>,<em> </em>heading to the PS5, with some going to the Nintendo Switch, but the plan extends beyond these four games and into some titles that might surprise Xbox fans.</p><div>

</div><div>



            
<p>I’ve been scouring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demos specifically for something laid back, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/">Spilled!</a> – despite sounding like the title of a musical about upturned milk – has delivered nicely. It’s a light and breezy ocean cleanup game that has you sailing a cute lil’ boat around polluted seas, cleansing oil patches and scooping up plastic bottles. Even if it doesn’t have the every-last-speck detailing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/viscera-cleanup-detail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a>, it satisfies in very similar ways, and I would very much like to get back out on the water whenever the full game is complete.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Spilled! technically operates on a cash-for-gunk system: returning any collected waste to a stationary mothership will reward you with coins, which can then be spent on improving your own boat’s speed, oil carrying capacity, and scoop size. Ultimately, though, these upgrades are optional, your only real task being the collection of those pollutants in the first instance. Plus the occasional rescue of gooed-up wildlife, who are subsequently added to... some kind of collection? It might just be a UI thing but I like to think all the animals come hang out on the boat out of gratitude.</p>
<p>Either way, the pleasure is very much found in the cleaning itself, rather than the rewards. And what a gentle, cosy kind of pleasure it is. Maybe as an English person, I just want to live out the fantasy of someone <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-62631320">relieving my nation’s water of its turds</a>, but anyone with a functioning heart should be warmed from within by Spilled!’s riverscrubbing. As the pitch-black splotches subside, hellish red waters gradually return to a crystalline blue, revealing even more happy fauna under the surface. Meanwhile, nearby hills are dotted liberally with solar panels and wind turbines, making each new stretch of spotless water feel like not just a return to the natural order but another step towards the harmonious green ideal that this world’s denizens have managed to figure out back on land.</p>

</figure>
<p>It’s not challenging in any way, but that’s kind of the point, and at least there are a few different types of clearable junk to break up the routine. Oil slicks can simply be sailed over, but discard plastic must be manually pushed back to the control ship, thus calling for more careful steering. Eventually you get a water cannon to clean up stains above the waterline; again, this might lack the puzzle element of PowerWash Sim’s swappable nozzles, but damned if I don’t smile at its cartoon bubbling effect.</p>
<p>On that note, Spilled! understands that any cleaning game worth its soap needs a healthy collection of ear-pleasing sounds. These keep the gratifaction coming, whether it’s the soft buzz of your oil vacuum, the airy doinking of plastic bottles knocking together in the scoop, or merely the light trickling as your boat passes through freshly cleared waters. That’s all on top of an appropriately flowy piano ‘n’ strings soundtrack, too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/">try the demo</a> yourself, including three stages of the game’s planned eight. Closer inspection of that Steam store page also reveals that Spilled! is actually being <em>developed</em> on a boat as well, so bonus seafaring points there for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172878/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-name-change-bioware<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="GpXcf2">BioWare’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23151929/dragon-age-dread-wolf-title-bioware-da4-dreadwolf"><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em></a> is no more. The next entry in the role-playing game franchise is now known as <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, the developer announced Thursday, ahead of a planned first look at gameplay on June 11.</p>
<p id="LHc7u4">Gary McKay, executive producer on Dragon Age and general manager of BioWare, says the name change for the fourth mainline Dragon Age game reflects the developer’s focus not on the game’s antagonist, but on the heroes you’ll play as in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p>
<p id="GldwGT">“Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them — as well as their lives,” <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">McKay said in a blog post</a>. “You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions — not your enemies — are the heart of this new experience.</p>
<p id="aFiu7l">“So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.” Hence, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p id="7zEjUt">BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts have been using the name <em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> for their follow-up to 2014’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/11/7134385/dragon-age-inquisition-review-ps4-xbox-one-playstation-4-pc"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a> for the past two years. So there are still plenty of product listings and watermarked screenshots that currently carry the old name for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. EA and BioWare will have no small amount of work for themselves to condition players to forget the old <em>Dreadwolf</em> name, but hopefully the gameplay they show next week will impress to the point where those memories are wiped away. No pressure, folks!</p>
<p id="8bV7UV">If you want to see 15 minutes of gameplay from <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, you’ll need to tune in to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage">Dragon Age YouTube channel</a> on June 11 at 8 a.m. PDT/11 a.m. EDT. BioWare’s new role-playing game promises to be an “incredible single-player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us,” McKay said. </p>
<p id="2bTnM2">The fourth Dragon Age game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/2018/12/6/18129767/dragon-age-dread-wolf-rises-teaser-trailer-tga-2018">first teased back in 2018</a>. McKay said that over the course of the game’s lengthy development, BioWare experimented with multiple concepts, including a multiplayer take on Dragon Age. Ultimately, however, they settled on a classic, single-player adventure, with the blessing of EA.</p>
<p id="mepCYG"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is bound for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, but does not have an announced release date. </p>

McKay says Solas will still be a major player in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but the title change is meant to put a spotlight on the companions you’ll recruit in the RPG.</p><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every <em>Dragon Age</em> game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay tells IGN. “We can’t wait for players to meet, connect and form their own personal relationships with the unique companions that make up The Veilguard. That’s the spirit of this game…of this story. Choosing who will join you on your adventure, fight alongside you, and be there by your side in the end.”</p><p>McKay confirmed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a></span> that <em>The Veilguard </em>will include seven companions. We’ll be meeting a few of them soon, as BioWare plans to release 15 minutes of footage highlighting the game’s opening on June 11 at 8 a.m. Pacific on the <em>Dragon Age </em>YouTube channel.</p><p>I understand the naming convention lines up with <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, which also was named after the team you were assembling, but <em>Dreadwolf </em>was a striking title that I will dearly miss. I already have my issues with <em>Dragon Age </em>not giving big storylines their due as it hops around its universe each game, so I hope what BioWare is saying about Solas remaining a fixture is true even as the name changes. I’m looking forward to obsessively scrubbing through 15 minutes of footage after a literal decade of waiting, though. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new report from Esquire has outlined the approximate costs for running a trailer during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outlet says</a> that according to ‘multiple marketing professionals’, the Summer Game Fest’s main show will cost “$250,000 for 1 minute, $350,000 for 1.5 minutes, $450,000 for 2 minutes, and $550,000 for 2.5 minutes”, with the prices allegedly being in line with last year’s edition of The Game Awards.</p>



<p>“If you add up all of the 1-to-2.5-minute trailers aired during last year’s Summer Game Fest, those price levels could translate into a $9.65 million”, says Esquire. Speaking to PR professionals, the outlet says that “PR folks at larger studios say these trailer premieres are worth the spend”, but “the current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers”.</p>



<p>What’s particularly interesting here, though, is that the prices this year are supposedly the same as those of The Game Awards, which could explain why the show pressed winners during their acceptance speeches to “Wrap it up” after only 30 seconds of speaking—which is $125,000 of potential marketing revenue.</p>



<p>Geoff Keighley is yet to respond to the report.</p>



<p>What do you think about the pricing of Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards trailer? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<h2 id="h-blockbuster-inc-interview">Blockbuster Inc Interview</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-were-the-inspirations-behind-blockbuster-inc">What were the inspirations behind Blockbuster Inc?</h3>



<p><strong>Panos Tzimas: </strong>Definitely.&nbsp;I mean, the game is definitely inspired and paying some sort of homage to this all-time classic, pretty much.&nbsp;It’s a niche and we’re exploring it right now with our own twist. So yeah, I mean, a lot of people will be comparing the two.&nbsp;And a lot of times, people will also say we’re the spiritual successors of the movies.</p>



<p>And we couldn’t be happier to hear that. So it’s fantastic.&nbsp;And we would love to deliver something that kind of like scratches that itch that people have from not being able to play this game anymore.&nbsp;It’s not available. So yeah, that’s pretty much what leads us to strive to produce the best game possible for the people and the fans.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-make-sure-there-was-much-more-than-that-top-layer-of-you-just-build-a-movie">How important was it to make sure there was much more than that top layer of you just build a movie?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas:</strong></strong> I mean, this is kind of like an effort and a project that’s been going back for like six years, especially for me.&nbsp;It started as a side project.&nbsp;So you can imagine, like, we had no clue as a team that we would reach this point where, you know, the expansion we had, like from the development standpoint and how deep pretty much it got.It kind of like evolved through time.</p>



<p>&nbsp;But yeah, definitely.&nbsp;I mean, obviously, as a small team of three people, we always strive for the best and we have to like, you know, at work pretty much every other studio that makes similar stuff has more people and more manpower. So we would even love to add even more depth to the game.&nbsp;So, yeah, definitely.&nbsp;You can say this was the goal and it still is. </p>



<p>And, you know, post release, it’s going to get even deeper.&nbsp;So, you know, we’re excited for people to try it out and, you know, also kind of like give us feedback and see where we get.</p>

Review - The Movies Meets The Sims | Buy, Wait, or Skip" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2PWVePpYs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-make-sure-there-was-a-detailed-tutorial-system">How important was it to make sure there was a detailed tutorial system?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: I think I think it’s extremely, extremely important, especially the way we structured our tutorial system.&nbsp;It’s not the classic mission oriented way of doing things because our focus is mostly on the sandbox kind of experience for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we don’t want to really interrupt people while they’re building their studio from the ground up.&nbsp;So we have like these chapters, what we call them for the tutorials.&nbsp;And everybody can kind of like hop back to any chapter they have questions about.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like an in-game encyclopedia, but like an interactive one.&nbsp;That’s the way we consider it.&nbsp;So extremely important. </p>



<p>I mean, I know for sure that a lot of people will feel a lot of familiarity with what’s going on in the game, especially simulation fans and management fans.&nbsp;But at the same time, you got to assume people, you know, will will need help and adjusting to the game and the new features that we’re adding, because even if you played the movies, we’re adding a lot of new stuff.&nbsp;And, you know, you got to kind of help people explore through all these options and, you know, figure out like the tips and tricks and everything for the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-is-a-lot-to-do-in-the-game-like-managing-schedules-taking-care-of-housing-the-food-you-offer-and-more-how-did-that-process-go-into-coming-up-with-the-features-that-you-guys-wanted-in-blockbuster-inc">There is a lot to do in the game like managing schedules, taking care of housing, the food you offer, and more. How did that process go into coming up with the features that you guys wanted in Blockbuster Inc.?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: It sounds difficult if we present it like that, but also keep in mind that a lot of these things help with automation within the game.&nbsp;So for example, the schedule is an automatic process that guides the people and employees in the studio and to their tasks.&nbsp;It’s also one of these things that we want to expand upon after the release where you can have like individual schedules for groups and specific things that you’re going to be creating. </p>



<p>And when it comes to city map, that’s what we call it when you go outside the studio and you can manage the rent and all these things.&nbsp;It’s also one of those things that we want to build upon.&nbsp;We want to make this city kind of like a live environment where you can hop on the award ceremonies and have it change and all these things through the decades, which is important for us to replicate the feelings of each decade and have people really draw them into every era so they can experience the cinematography and everything.</p>



<p>Pretty much the Hollywood experience through our lens.&nbsp;So yeah, I mean, especially with Costas, we talk a lot about balancing and the design of the game and how we can help people use all these tools that we’re giving them as a system-based game, but at the same time make their lives a bit easier so you don’t have to really micromanage everything.&nbsp;And that’s what guides our decision and that’s why we listen to the community and see what they wish and what they would change. And yeah, we’re really active there.</p>



<p><strong>Alkis Tagaras</strong>: Exactly, like community feedback was very important and still is.&nbsp;So yeah, they tell us what they like and what they don’t, and we listen, we manage, we delegate things, and we do what we have to do, I guess.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-is-it-juggling-all-this-feedback-and-everything-you-get-in-nbsp-what-i-guess-maybe-is-the-process-like-nbsp-do-you-compare-it-to-what-you-already-have-planned-or-how-does-that-work">How is it juggling all this feedback and everything you get in?&nbsp;What I guess maybe is the process like?&nbsp;Do you compare it to what you already have planned or how does that work?</h3>



<p><strong><strong>Tzimas</strong></strong>: It’s kind of like both, but we always pay attention to patterns.&nbsp;So if we see specific feedback, a type of feedback that always reoccurs within the community, then we know that it’s something that makes sense for us to at least investigate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we heard some, as you said, ridiculous, we wouldn’t call it that, but we would call it funny, hilarious feedback for the game. It’s amazing to see how creative people can get through the community, but as I said before, keep in mind we’re just three core people and we can’t really, we gotta adjust everything to a tight schedule and we also gotta pay attention to add value to the game every time we add something new from the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I guess that’s it.&nbsp;First of all, it’s a pattern. So if it’s a pattern, then we’re gonna definitely investigate it.&nbsp;And then it’s just about efficiency and if we can manage to pull it in the game without disrupting any other mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-has-it-been-like-developing-and-releasing-a-game-when-there-is-so-much-turmoil-and-uncertainty-in-the-industry">What has it been like developing and releasing a game when there is so much turmoil and uncertainty in the industry?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas:</strong> I think everybody can comment, but I’m gonna start.&nbsp;For me, it’s a surreal feeling.&nbsp;It shows our resilience and passion about this project.No doubt, we just love working on this game.&nbsp;Also, I want to add that we’re lucky to have such publishers, because they’re supporting us.&nbsp;Not only financially, but throughout everything, we’re on the same page on what we want to deliver.I guess we do consider ourselves very lucky on that matter.&nbsp;I mean, we all hear stories about publishing developers, but props to them, props to the team.</p>



<p>We have a very good relationship between us. I think through the tough times, we hold each other up.&nbsp;It’s just teamwork, passion, and resilience in the end.&nbsp;I see a lot of indie teams that are struggling, but you gotta stay focused, man.</p>



<p>You gotta push through these tough times, because it’s kind of like a loop.&nbsp;Good times will come back, and then there’s gonna be hard times again, and that’s just gonna keep going, going, going.&nbsp;If you love game development, you’re gonna make it. I think that’s what I want to add.&nbsp;Maybe Alkis and Kostas can comment on how they view this whole thing.</p>



<p><strong>Tagaras</strong>: I mean, it’s exactly what Panos said, right?&nbsp;You need passion.&nbsp;You need a good team. We are lucky that we have good publishers, and we communicate very good.&nbsp;It takes a lot.&nbsp;It’s very challenging. I’m not gonna lie.&nbsp;Of course, it’s very challenging, but if you love what you do, you go to the end.</p>



<p><strong>Kostas Ventouras</strong>: Yeah, same thing.&nbsp;All of us started with the idea of making a game we like, and what made it happen is that we kept ourselves together.&nbsp;All of us wanted to make a good result out of it.We kept having good ideas, things to add, and as long as we have the time and the ability, we will keep adding stuff because we want to get the best out of it.&nbsp;I think that’s really what drives it the most.</p>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong> Yeah, and we’re having fun, right?&nbsp;So, it’s not just work for us.&nbsp;I think that’s important when you wake up, and it doesn’t feel like work no matter how many hours we’re gonna crunch, and that’s what keeps the passion alive. </p>



<p>Even post-release, adding all this new stuff that we have, concepts and ideas, this is not the end for us.&nbsp;So, that’s what keeps us active.&nbsp;It’s also the community. So, I think once you get the community in, they also feed you.&nbsp;You feed off each other, their energies, and it keeps the engine ignited and everything as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-was-a-full-video-editor-for-the-movies-a-plan-to-include-from-the-start-in-blockbuster-inc">Was a full video editor for the movies a plan to include from the start in Blockbuster Inc.?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>Not at all.&nbsp;When I first designed the game, it was way closer as a concept to, can I name drop other games as inspirations?&nbsp;I guess I can.It was kind of like a blend of Game Dev Tycoon with Prison Architect, if it makes any sense.</p>



<p>So, it was also 2D back then, so it was never a 3D game originally, but as I said, as we started posting stuff and seeing what the community told us, everybody was expecting for this new, the movie’s kind of spiritual successor, and without this video editor and the visual feedback from the movies that you make, people were just like, okay, so what are you guys doing?&nbsp;How are we going to experience like Hollywood or film would, as we call it in the game, how can we experience it fully?&nbsp;And then we just realized, okay, we got to do it.</p>



<p>We definitely have to add something like this.&nbsp;And again, I’m just going to keep saying that, post-release, it’s going to get even better, even more content, even more animations to pick from.&nbsp;So, yeah, it was never the plan originally, but there’s a lot of stuff we added because of the people.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-did-the-team-decide-on-adding-features-genres-themes-and-more-into-the-game">How did the team decide on adding features, genres, themes, and more into the game?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I think we’re just trying to capture the majority of stuff.&nbsp;Obviously, each one of us have seen shows and movies that we like and pop culture elements, which we intend to add even more in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But originally, there were specific genres and themes that we had to add just as a base for the game. For example, vampires, you can’t really do a 1920s run without vampires.&nbsp;It’s just the basic elements, trying to get all the mainstream attention to this stuff.&nbsp;And then post-release, we’ll just keep adding. I think eventually, we might even have polls on what people would love to see, and we can make something close to the real stuff, but mostly as a reference.</p>



<h3 id="h-was-there-anything-that-just-didn-t-click-or-had-to-be-removed">Was there anything that just didn’t click or had to be removed?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas:</strong> We have not abandoned…&nbsp;Kostas, you can correct me if I’m wrong, but we have never abandoned a feature that we intended to add, but some of the features are not fully fleshed out yet completely.&nbsp;And we will also not abandon them, but we do have to prioritize. </p>



<p>There’s stuff for the meta game after the 60s or the 70s in game where stocks and shares come into play.&nbsp;And these things had to take lesser priority over, for example, the video editor that you said, because we saw that people really want a video editor. So yeah, we never cut content from the game, but we do have keep improving a lot of aspects of the game. So yeah, that’s pretty much how we roll.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-you-see-just-everything-you-guys-have-done-as-a-team-to-get-to-this-point-what-is-the-first-thing-that-goes-through-your-mind-knowing-it-s-here-it-s-out-now-it-s-just-supporting-it">When you see just everything you guys have done as a team to get to this point, what is the first thing that goes through your mind knowing it’s here, it’s out, now it’s just supporting it?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I don’t even know, man.&nbsp;It’s just a mix of emotions.&nbsp;To be honest, it feels surreal. Even talking about it, it’s just been so long that I think we’re all very excited and terrified at the same time.&nbsp;We even had a prologue out.&nbsp;It’s not even our first release. </p>



<p>There was a demo out and we saw the feedback from the people.&nbsp;I mean, we got 95% positive reactions.&nbsp;So yeah, I don’t know. I just say ecstatic.&nbsp;I think that’s the only word that describes my feelings.&nbsp;Maybe the guys can comment on what they feel like, but yeah, ecstatic and terrified.</p>



<p><strong>Tagaras</strong>: Exactly.&nbsp;It’s a mixture.&nbsp;I’m worried and excited.I’m happy.&nbsp;Every day I’m telling Thanos, 10 days, nine days, eight days, seven days.&nbsp;It’s crazy.It’s so surreal, but it’s exciting.&nbsp;Yeah, for sure.</p>



<p><strong>Ventouras</strong>: Yeah, I think that’s the thing.&nbsp;Mostly, it’s normal to be a little bit stressed on what you expect to see, but I think at this point, we can be optimistic enough about it.</p>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>Yeah.&nbsp;And just one last thing to add to this question is that we’re not that stressed in a negative way because we know that we’re going to keep being super active on the community and the development post-release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So for us, it’s just work as usual. We just hope people understand that there’s definitely going to be a roadmap in the future.&nbsp;There’s definitely going to be more features than Conan added.&nbsp;So there’s, in a sense, nothing to be worried about. I mean, sure, some people might not enjoy what we created, but that’s all part of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-important-was-it-to-allow-that-flexibility-and-that-freedom-from-players-with-steam-workshop">How important was it to allow that flexibility and that freedom from players with Steam Workshop?</h3>



<p><strong>Tzimas</strong>: Extremely important.&nbsp;I think it’s a game like this one that need to have a workshop, like full-on creativity.&nbsp;And even the simplest example, there’s a lot of shows and movies that we can’t really replicate for copyright reasons, but that’s where the community comes into play and they create their very own unique stuff. </p>



<p>We will expand upon this as well.&nbsp;But for now, they can share their sets.&nbsp;And if somebody wants to get in the game and not have to build their own sets because they want to focus on the management side only, that’s fine. We got you.&nbsp;So as I said, extremely important.&nbsp;Involve the people as much as possible. This is the way we operate as a team in all aspects.&nbsp;Concepts, ideas, feedback, workshop, anything.&nbsp;And we will try to include even more options for the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-future-plans-for-blockbuster-inc">What are the future plans for Blockbuster Inc.?</h2>



<p><strong>Tzimas: </strong>I said, for example, one of the things that we want to add, a minor thing, is the schedules.&nbsp;Even more schedules, even more content.&nbsp;We cannot really say anything specific right now because the first month after release, it’s really important for us to gather all the feedback from a massive player base that’s going to play the game, hopefully. </p>



<p>And we’re going to direct pretty much our roadmap through that.&nbsp;So we can’t really say because we can’t promise something that’s not going to happen for the roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stay tuned. You will see a roadmap very soon.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The update also includes a series of new character cosmetics and new brooms, allowing players to zoom around the Hogwarts campus in style. All of the update's features--including cosmetics--are available for free (though it's possible some of them must first be unlocked in-game via quests or other activities). Some of the new cosmetic items featured in the update include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Azkaban Coat</li><li dir="ltr">Azkaban Prisoner’s Outfit</li><li dir="ltr">The Glasses That Lived</li><li dir="ltr">Lavender Borealis Broom</li></ul><p dir="ltr">One major change included in the update is the ability to reset talent tree points. This will allow players a chance to change up their build and experiment with different playstyles on a single character, as opposed to starting a new one from scratch just to try out some different talents.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Hogwarts Legacy summer update has expanded access to the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest, which was previously available only to PlayStation users.

        <p>Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls predicts a boost to Game Pass Ultimate, and some disruption for Sony</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-continues-xboxs-bet-on-activision-boost-for-game-pass">recently confirmed that the upcoming annual Call of Duty premium release will enter its Game Pass multi-game subscription service</a> at launch.</p>
<p>This promises to boost interest in Game Pass and disrupt Sony’s full game business, but by how much? While it’s challenging to predict the specific commercial impact, Activision’s product strategy, and the agreements made during its acquisition by Microsoft, means the impact will not be as far reaching as it might have been in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft follows through with well-established strategy</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft’s decision to put all first-party games releases directly into Game Pass was a watershed moment for multi-game subscription services and propelled the service to more significant consumer adoption over the subsequent years.</p>
<p>Following the huge cost of Activision Blizzard’s acquisition, there was some recent speculation around whether its biggest franchise, Call of Duty, would make it day-and-date into Game Pass. Realistically, it would be difficult for Microsoft to row back on this key policy either by windowing the inclusion of the game or placing the game behind a more expensive subscription paywall. This would have undermined the positioning of Game Pass and weakened its appeal significantly.</p>
<p>Adding new Call of Duty releases to the service will attract entirely new and lapsed subscribers to Game Pass. We expect most of those new subscribers to be at the Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers. There is no doubt that adding Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to Game Pass at launch will be expensive, at least initially, for Microsoft, but there are factors that will reduce the costs associated by such a move, while still maximizing the positive impact on subscription numbers.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an online game, inclusion of Call of Duty will drive upsell to Game Pass Ultimate from Game Pass Console generating higher average revenue per user.</li>
<li>The potential to offer early access to those who buy the premium/ultimate edition of the game, including those that upgrade having got access to the standard version of the game through Game Pass. This strategy worked well during the launch of Starfield in 2023 and, if used again, will boost premium revenue streams at launch</li>
<li>Call of Duty is now predominantly a live service game that monetises strongly in-game. Microsoft will be trading premium full-game sales in exchange for a bigger audience that can be monetised in-game instead</li>
<li>As part of the conditions of buying Activision Blizzard, Microsoft agreed to allow third-party cloud gaming service providers access to future Call of Duty games at launch. While third-party multi-game subscription services – such as Sony’s PS Plus - are very unlikely to be able to afford the licensing costs of such a move, Microsoft’s strategy will be exposing more gamers to the franchise via bring-your-own-game services such as Nvidia’s GeForce Now</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sony will be commercially disrupted, but F2P and live-service attributes lessen the blow </strong></p>
<p>PlayStation Call of Duty gamers will inevitably be disrupted to an extent and that will be a concern for Sony. At its recent annual Business Segment meeting, Sony highlighted that Call of Duty was one of ten major franchises that made up over 50% of its storefront revenue over the last three fiscal years.</p>
<p>However, the live-service nature of Call of Duty, and its very popular free-to-play offering Warzone, means the disruption will not be as significant as it might have been in the past when all revenue from a content point of view was centred on premium sales. Ampere’s data shows that Call of Duty HQ (the launcher covering Modern Warfare III, Modern Warfare II and Warzone) has consistently high monthly active users of between 22 to 26 million across PlayStation, Xbox and Steam.</p>

<p>Those that own both Xbox and PlayStation consoles may be swayed to play the game on Microsoft’s devices, but cross-platform play and multi-platform accounts means that this is not necessarily a permanent decision. Indeed, there could be scenarios where PlayStation-first multi-console gamers switch to Xbox to play the premium campaign while still playing the free-to-play Warzone on their preferred console under a single Activision account. Ampere’s consumer data shows ownership overlap between the disc-based PS5 and Xbox Series X in the US is around 35% for 16-64 year olds, so the numbers this is relevant to are significant.</p>
<p>Those Call of Duty gamers that have yet to upgrade to the latest generation of consoles and are ready to invest, will look more favourably on the Xbox Series offer. This will not have a major impact on current console sales trends, but it will influence a small share of buyers as they assess the advantages and disadvantages of the respective platforms. It’s worth noting that Call of Duty gamers are fairly high games content, service and accessories spenders, and adding more of those to Xbox will be a boost for the lifetime revenues of Microsoft’s player base.</p>

Not anything professional, mind you: just a humble compilation of recipes inspired by the games that made me hungry, a community-turned-personal project that I got over the finishing line more out of spite than anything else. At the time, video game cookbooks weren’t much of a thing, although pioneers on sites like Tumblr and SnackOrDie (and later, Pinterest and YouTube) were paving the way with homemade projects that eventually launched into entire geek cooking and baking channels where players could learn how to create facsimiles of in-game foods or goodies styled to look like game items or characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These days, I’m outclassed by miles. These sorts of books or baking projects are no longer a hobbyist pursuit; you can get official video game cookbooks written by actual chefs, centered on famously delicious titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the Pokémon series. Recently, the Official Fallout Cookbook played a huge role in the debut of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, with scores of fans brewing up batches of Nuka Cola and Blamco Mac and Cheese to dine on while marathoning the show.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can even play a tabletop game that requires baking as part of its play, as with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Edible-Games-Cookbook-Play-your-ebook/dp/B08738MVBZ">Edible Games Cookbook by developer Jenn Sandercock</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Things have come a long way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I look back now and see the rise of video game cooking as part of the greater geekcraft movement of the late ‘10s, when the Internet was still driven by novelties and niche tchotchkes, and what holes existed in games merchandise were filled by hobbyists and artisans on Etsy. These days, I still like to make video game meals on my own, and it’s a little easier than it once was, at least in the selection department. Now that crafting and survival games have become so popular, there are a lot more dishes to choose from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But I still respect the classics. The Sims, for example, is one of those games that often inspires experiments in the kitchen not so much because the recipes are impressive or complex, but because I always get so hungry when I play. The Cooking skill has 10 levels, and as your Sim progresses in rank, the recipes increase in complexity. Oddly, French Toast is among the later recipes the Sims learn in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which I found confusing because of how easy the dish is to make. It’s truly a starter recipe. I remember whipping up batches of it when I was seven years old.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be fair though, I don't remember baking the French Toast in the oven, either; typically, it’s a skillet or griddle-made food. In The Sims, the character animation for making French toast shows them putting the ingredients in what appears to be a full-sized turkey roaster and then sticking it in the oven. I’m not sure why they do this, as other items are made on top of the stove. But then, The Sims is not played for its accurate reflection of reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To that end, here’s an updated recipe from my little old fan project, revised to reflect 10 years of improved skill and tastes. I hope you have fun making some video game foods of your own.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="This Ain’t Your Sims 3 Baked French Toast"><span>This Ain’t Your Sims 3 Baked French Toast</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This recipe is decadent and decidedly less canon than my lead-in suggests, as it requires several ingredients your Sim would probably never have (the original, in-game ingredients include two apples and one egg, end of list). That said, you can simplify a few things by using plain white bread, skipping the fruit syrup (grate a thick layer of frozen butter along the bottom of the pan instead), and using plain milk in the egg mixture.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">10-12 slices of bread (you can use white bread, but I like to “cheat” by using flavored bread, specifically seasonal Franz fruit varieties like blueberry, lemon crème, or apple crisp).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Six fresh sliced peaches (or 1 can, drained) or 1 ½ cups drained blueberries</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">1 cup brown sugar</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">½ cup butter</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">2 tablespoons water</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Six eggs</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">½ cup orange juice</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">⅓ cup orange liquor</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">½ cup half n half</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">1 tsp vanilla</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">¼ tsp salt</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Grated orange peel of about one orange</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For maple rum syrup:</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">1 cup of honey</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">1 cup of maple syrup</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">2 tablespoons dark rum or whiskey</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, butter, and water and bring to a boil.

<p data-characters="297" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m ashamed to admit that, until recently, I didn’t realize that CD Projekt was behind the Good Old Game distribution platform. Of all the video game PC clients out there, Steam is undoubtedly the head honcho, but GOG is a great alternative, especially when it comes to retro releases.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">However, there’s something you need to be aware of. As outlined in a section on the GOG.com <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730340487709-Review-your-Cloud-Saves-to-avoid-loss-of-files?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support page</a>, the platform will begin removing Cloud Save files from its servers after August 31. Everyone who has an account is encouraged to review their own files if they don’t want to lose any data.</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via support.gog.com</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">However, it’s only going to be on saves that exceed the “default allocation limit” of 200MB per game. But it’s in your best interest to see what – if anything – you’re happy to delete from the servers in order to stay within the storage cap.</p> <h2 id="h-why-s-this-happening" data-injectable="false">Why’s this happening?</h2> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">According to the article, GOG is limiting cloud space to take into consideration the growing demand for storage in this modern gaming era. The message says that such measures being put into place after August are to “ensure that all players have access to sufficient and manageable space for their game progress” and that the company can “keep the associated costs under control.”</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">If you absolutely want to make sure you don’t lose any save data from the GOG cloud service, <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730324957213-How-do-I-back-up-my-cloud-saves?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a> will give you a quick lowdown on how to back up files through the GOG GALAXY app. Once the time comes, data will be deleted from the servers, starting with unnecessary files, such as “things that are not at all related to your game, but have found their way into the Cloud Save folder.”</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">However, save files that are stored “locally on your computer” will not be deleted. In short: if you have a GOG account – especially if you use GALAXY – make sure you <a href="https://www.gog.com/account/cloud-saves/page/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review the games on your account</a> to make sure they’re within the 200MB limit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a new name, and that it won't be long before we finally get to see some gameplay for the long-awaited RPG.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a>, BioWare outlines the reasons for the change and teases what you can expect from the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>franchise, although no release date or release window have been revealed as yet.</p>

<h2><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>is now&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>executive producer Gary McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s previous name,&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf</em>, didn't adequately capture "what this game is all about" or "how strongly" the studio feels about the game's characters and narrative.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>apparently expresses that fervor much more strongly, although given that we still don't know much about the game or its setup, I think the difference is relatively moot at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=-4_juBWx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=AyENxo3z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a snazzy new name.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned blog post, McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will introduce seven companions, each with "deep and compelling storylines" associated with them.</p>

<p>McKay also points to the fact that each&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game introduces a new hero with a new identity: the Gray Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisitor. Perhaps "The Veilguard" will be the name of the new game's hero.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it won't be very long before we get to find out what's going on with<em>&nbsp;Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, because BioWare says it's planning to unveil the first gameplay footage for the game on June 11th at 8am Pacific.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=zJMCMi69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=fXuZTOBZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em>'s original name was based around the elf Solas.</figcaption></figure><p>At that time, BioWare will show off "over 15 minutes" of gameplay from the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, so we'll finally learn what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>(or&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>) actually is.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-named-as-next-dragon-age-game">officially unveiled</a> as&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>back in June 2022, having been in development for some years prior. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-reaches-dragon-age-dreadwolf-alpha-milestone">passed its alpha development milestone</a> in October that same year, and BioWare subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-be-fully-revealed-in-summer-2024">promised a full reveal this summer</a>, which it looks like we're about to get.</p>

            <p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">Eurogamer reported earlier today</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has a new name - which has now been formally announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare boss Gary McKay revealed the game's new title in a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">blog post</a> today that also offered fresh details on the game - and an explanation for why its name has changed at the eleventh hour. 
</p>
<p>
"Every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story," McKay wrote. "Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game.

<p>
"And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions - right? Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them - as well as their lives. 
</p>
<p>
"You'll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world," McKay continued. "Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.
</p>
<p>
"So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you'll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."
</p>
<p>
In Dragon Age, the Veil is known to fans as the magical barrier that separates the normal world from the mystical Fade. The suggestion that players will form some kind of defence force - a Veil guard - of this is an intriguing new clue as to what we'll be getting up to when the game launches. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, BioWare has said we'll get our first look at 15 minutes of gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard next week, on Tuesday 11th June at 4pm UK time. Another date to add to your bustling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">not-E3 / Summer Game Fest week calendar</a>!
