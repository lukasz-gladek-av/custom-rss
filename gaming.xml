            <p>
It's coming up to a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> received its 1.0 release, and ahead of that anniversary developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/stunlock-studios">Stunlock Studios</a> shared a trailer earlier this week for the game's first big update, Invaders of Oakveil. The update itself will be free (nice!), and introduces a whole new area to explore, the titular Oakveil Woodlands, a woodsy area where "corruption" is spreading (not nice).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The big baddie of this update is Megara the Serpent Queen, presumably the source of said corruption. She's got some minions called The Venomblades, which sounds like a great name for a goth rollerblading group. In terms of gameplay additions, there's a new arena-building feature to be found in your castle, alongside one-on-one duels that can be found out in the wild that are consequence free. Oh, there's three new weapon types to mess around with, claws, twinblades, and throwing daggers, as well as seven new spells to boot.
</p>

<p>
Combat is also getting a big refresh, with stats seeing a rework, gear receiving some balance changes, and the addition of "new customization tools." Blood types have been reworked too, passive spells are apparently "more impactful", and unlocking spell points gives you some passive bonuses too. Lots of changes!
</p>
<p>
Crafting will be a bit easier too now as you can take ingredients from your vault without having to actually go to your vault to get them. Horse girls will delight in the fact that there'll be stables to store your horses in as well, alongside the ability to fill your prisons with creatures to take blood from (that one's not so much for the horse girls).
</p>
<p>
Alongside a few other changes that you can read about on the game's <a href="https://playvrising.com/oakveil">official website</a>, there's also the fact that V Rising will also be officially supported on Steam Deck. All of this is coming April 28th, so you've only got a couple of weeks to wait.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vegas-falcons-win-first-cdl-match-by-beating-optic-texas.1162962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/vegas-falcons-won-first-cdl-series-match/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most insane losing streak in the history of esports has just been broken as the Vegas Falcons <strong>finally </strong>found a win over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. It was a loss streak of 20 matches back-to-back for the Vegas Falcons, and it took a monumental roster overhaul for the first victory to be found.</p>



<p>Given some of the changes between teams, the win over OpTic Texas is nothing short of poetic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-soar">Falcons Soar</h2>



<p>Before this fixture against OpTic Texas, the Vegas Falcons sat on <strong>zero wins </strong>in the CDL 2025 season. From Major to Minor and through the qualifying stages, the team failed to gain traction in a single series, falling against all comers in historic fashion.</p>



<p>It was harsh, but several elements contributed to the streak, such as an ever-changing lineup of players that never let chemistry be made. The all-Saudi roster was recently refreshed with North American players, except Exnid, who has been a consistent talent in recent weeks.</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about signings was Pred, the SMG aficionado who came over from OpTic Texas mere days ago. Pred won the CDL Championship with OpTic Texas last season, but a troubled hiatus and a paltry return to the roster led to this change landing.</p>



<p>In the series against OpTic Texas, the comms were on point, the team was frying, and the movement was slick. In the last week, something stunning must have happened to the Vegas Falcons because this win revealed a hunger to succeed.</p>



<p>It was as though every map was neck-and-neck. The opening Hardpoint was evenly matched, the first Search went to an eleventh round, and the Control was a back-and-forth. The final Hardpoint was all Falcons, though. That sealed the deal and landed the organisation its first win in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Damn.</p>

You can cancel your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> pre-order, you can hold off on picking up a Switch 2 for that inevitable The Duskbloods release, because there's a pretty good reason to return to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Earlier this week, modder extraordinaire Yui released the Dark Souls Remastered seamless co-op mod, which, if you can believe it, allows you to play through the game in online co-op with minimal interruptions.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yui shared a look at the mod in action in a video on her YouTube channel, and it certainly looks like it's doing what it says on the tin. One thing she did note is that this is an "early release" of the mod, meaning there might be a few bugs along the way, though there shouldn't be too many, and asked to let her know if you do encounter any.

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/557559/dark-souls-remastered-seamless-co-op-mod">Polygon</a> she also explained that this one was apparently easier to make than her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">Elden Ring co-op mod</a>, though there was a particular challenge in how old Dark Souls is. One big thing Yui had to work hard on was making it so that parts of the game wouldn't unload if someone got too far away from the host. In any case, the mod is apparently in good working order, so it still seems like the best way to play if you aren't a fan of how Souls games' co-op generally works.
</p>
<p>
It's a cool mod because you can play with up to five other people too, and progression will save in your copy of the game even if you're not the host. Unlike the base game, regular enemies scale in strength depending on how many people you're playing with, so there'll be a bit more of a challenge too.
</p>
<p>
Definitely seems like a good way to kill some time ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-knocks-back-an-estus-and-takes-a-swing-at-may-2025">Elden Ring Nightreign's release next month</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter.1162938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a bold move to stand up an extraction shooter game in this day and age. Many have come before and have fallen short of expectations, and the ones that have stuck around have effortlessly dominated the scene – I’m looking at <em>you</em>, Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Regardless, Bungie is breaking into the genre with Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. In a recent interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky sat down with Joe Ziegler, the game’s director, to learn <strong>exactly why </strong>the team wants to try making a success of an extraction shooter when so many have failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-exciting-and-super-unique">‘Super Exciting and Super Unique’</h2>



<p>The extraction shooter model ebbs and flows, but it’s fast becoming a staple of the wider industry, with many developers having thrown their hat in the ring. The next biggest studio working on an extraction shooter is Bungie, breaking into the vertical with Marathon, a reboot of a game from the 1990s.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon REVEAL Interview with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>When Jake Lucky caught up with Joe Ziegler after a session testing Marathon, he asked <strong>why </strong>the team had aimed to produce an extraction shooter when the market has a tentative reception at best for new games in that space.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Extraction shooters to us symbolise this rare circumstance in gaming where you have a lot of different choices inside of a game experience, and all of them become meaningful in a weird way. As you’re playing it, you get these really dramatic stories that occur about survival. Every decision you make kind of becomes a point of regret or a point of excitement.</p>



<p>This idea that behind the corner there’s this brand new light that could exist there or this dark hole that you will get destroyed in. That adventurous aspect of trying to survive a dangerous environment is just super exciting and super unique, and I think that’s really why the extraction shooter was such a perfect game for us to make. </p>



<p>It’s because, the studio likes to do these crazy FPS experiences that really have uplifting and very emotionally engaging moments – we wanted to take that to the next level with something like Marathon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team explained that, with Marathon, they want to create a social extraction experience that’s more enjoyable, accessible, and entertaining. It’s not trying to become the next Escape from Tarkov and it’s certainly not as punishing as the 10-year-old Battlestate Games extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is all about revelling in an adventure with friends, that’s why the core gameplay loop is accessible only in a team format – for now. Bungie wants players to have an exciting experience that never culminates in a depressing loss after an hour in a single raid, which can be typical for Escape from Tarkov players.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this new extraction shooter, or do you think the genre is done? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If Escape From Tarkov is the PUBG of the extraction shooter, boldly striking out into a new genre despite humble origins, then Bungie’s upcoming shooter, Marathon, is the big-budget refinement that could become the emerging category’s Fortnite. Coming from a studio with a pedigree for first-person shooters that’s virtually unmatched, and which wields the resources to take a good idea and reimagine it in a disturbing, beautifully detailed sci-fi universe, it’s easy to see how Bungie just might pull it off. But with a concept that’s so inherently geared towards the hardcore PvP crowd and such a clear departure from what they’ve done in the past, it’s certainly not without risks, even if they do manage to capture the usual FPS magic they’re known for. Even so, after spending the better part of two days sliding and gunning my way through Tau Ceti’s relentless ruins, I was hooked, and can’t wait to group up with my most tryhard friends and ruin people’s day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon is an extraction shooter where you and two friends are dropped into an extremely unmerciful wasteland to battle deadly enemies, including rival players, all in the name of loot and glory. If you’ve played Escape From Tarkov, then you’ll be familiar with this PvPvE framing, which forces you to ante up any loot you bring along with you, as it’s permanently lost if you fail to exfiltrate before time runs out or your team is killed. Those distressingly high stakes immediately got my blood pumping and made each match feel like the most important one so far. After fighting tooth and nail against surprisingly challenging AI enemies and ruthless fellow Runners to get a high-level rifle that could down most enemies in two hits, I wasn’t about to let my guard down for even a moment and risk losing it all to some unworthy foe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If, like me, you bemoaned the quiet, undignified death of PvP’s relevance in Destiny 2, then you might share my eagerness to see Bungie focused squarely on a competitive experience here, and everything I played so far indicates they’ve still more than got what it takes to pull it off. Weapons and movement feels crisp, fluid, and incredibly satisfying in that rarified way that few studios can achieve, and the added element of hero shooter-like abilities, like one that lets you blast enemies with kinetic energy, sending them flying away, gives that extra kick you need to feel like a supernaturally powered badass. Marathon almost immediately feels fantastic to play, and as soon as I took out a robot who took a potshot at me from the window of a nearby building and tried out his weapon for myself on a nearby enemy, it was love at first snipe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This gets even better once you start to familiarize yourself with the class-based Runners available to you (four of which I got to play extensively, out of the six that will be available at launch). Glitch is all about mobility and controlling positioning, and has abilities that help her move fast, jump up to areas others can’t reach, and push enemies away with a blast of kinetic energy. Locus is a tanky soldier who can pull up a shield to block incoming fire and launch a flurry of homing missiles at enemies, while Blackbird is all about intel and using her gadgets to ping any enemies within an area for the whole team, and sending out little robotic drones to seek and destroy nearby enemies. My personal favorite though, was Void: a deft ninja who can turn invisible for a time and deploy massive clouds of smoke to lose and confuse the enemy within. Each of these characters offers a completely different way to play Marathon, and by coordinating with my teammates, we were able to put together a balanced team of Runners who complemented one another’s strengths and helped make up for any weaknesses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That came in handy as we explored dark and forgotten places throughout Marathon’s maps, which were filled with deadly creatures, like a species of giant ticks who ran at me frantically, and surprisingly accurate robots who were much, much better at surrounding and overwhelming players than the vast majority of AI enemies found in other games. Fighting these foes was no joke, but the loot was well worth it, whether it was finding a backpack that allowed for more storage space, a weapon that gave me better odds against a rival crew, or just some consumable healing items I could rely upon in a pinch. Some of the extremely rare and powerful items, of which my team only found a handful during our matches, changed things up quite significantly, like a backpack that turned the user invisible whenever they interacted with a container while wearing it – extremely useful in a game where you’re being hunted by everyone else on the map.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Marathon provided me with tons of memorable moments of elation after a narrow victory and the occasionally sour taste of defeat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon’s tensest moments, though, happen when you encounter enemy crews and inevitably clash in a bid to claim one another’s loot. Maybe we’d spot a crew in the distance and stealthily follow them – waiting for the right moment to stage an ambush – or sometimes we’d hear other players in the distance fighting off security forces and decide to go catch them when their guard was down, scooping up whatever goodies they were about to claim. And, of course, sometimes we found ourselves on the receiving end of that ruthless equation and had to scramble as one of us was downed by sudden gunfire from a rival team. These moments are when the PvP magic really shines and leaves you with stories to tell your friends, like the time my group got entangled in a nine-player free-for-all and came out unscathed thanks to some well-timed smoke grenades, or another time where both of my teammates were killed, but we came back to win it thanks to a clutch revive the other team didn’t see coming. Just like the most epic, heart-pounding moments of a battle royale match, Marathon provided me with tons of memorable moments of elation after a narrow victory and the occasionally sour taste of defeat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we’d gotten our spoils or completed an objective or two, it was time to haul ass to the exfiltration beacon and stand near it long enough to be pulled out of the firefight and returned safely back to our base in outer space with our bloody bounty. But lighting that beacon also lets everyone else on the map know you’re trying to make off with your goods, via a giant blue light that shoots up into the sky for a prolonged period of time. This makes your last moments in the area pretty intense, or, if you’re like me, offers some exciting opportunities to kill a group right as they’re preparing to leave and benefit from all of their hard work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of Marathon’s “to the victors go the spoils” reward system is that in a pretty short amount of time, those with skill will enter fresh matches with gear that easily outmatches less skilled players, making them even less likely to be able to pull off a victory. Bungie’s gone out of its way to try and make it so a poorly geared squad still stands a chance against those with better loot if they play well, and you can always simply employ the strategy of avoiding other players until you’ve got a few extractions and some at least decent loot under your belt, but even so, it seems like it could get pretty demoralizing in short order if you run into a bout of bad luck and start to feel like you’ll never catch a break.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was lucky enough to win the vast majority of my matches, and after the initial hump of stockpiling some basic equipment in my vault and unlocking a few permanent upgrades to make the going easier, I felt like even if I fell in battle and lost all my best stuff, at least I’d have some adequate backup gear to recover with. But that won’t be the case for everyone, and I wonder how big the chunk of players will be who simply run into a brick wall in their first few hours, log off, and never return. At least in Escape from Tarkov you’ve got your Kappa case to hold your most valuable items and protect them from being lost on the battlefield – Marathon has none of those safety measures, instead opting for a system where you’re given a sort of pity loadout, called a sponsored package, which sets you up with some basic gear after you’ve been quite literally bled dry. This definitely helps ice the wound of a string of bad luck, but might not exactly be the most comforting consolation prize.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wonder how big the chunk of players will be who simply run into a brick wall in their first few hours, log off, and never return.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, it very well might be a good thing that Marathon seemingly refuses to compromise on its dedication to ensuring each match has real, keenly felt stakes, even if it turns some folks off from it – I certainly count myself among those who enjoy a bit of sweatiness and quite liked how invested I was forced to be every single time I deployed onto a new map. But they definitely risk a situation where it feels like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, to the detriment of those who are on the unfortunate side of that brutal equation. Time will tell before we know how that will shake out, but even in my short time with it, I already felt a bit of friction emanating from those on the server who kept dying repeatedly and felt like they were getting outclassed by those with quality loadouts.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon PlayStation Showcase 2023 Trailer</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that could be the key to preventing people from falling off is Marathon’s ongoing meta progression system, which I found surprisingly engaging in my time with it. Even though your loot is probably destined to be stripped off your still-warm corpse and stuffed into some rude opponent’s backpack, you can at least comfort yourself in the various perk trees and ongoing quests you’ll find in the menus between rounds of play. You might not have made it back alive from your most recent escapade, but maybe you were able to loot some chests from a specific part of the map or complete some other objective in your quest log before you went cold. In that case, you can at least still make your way through the faction questlines and upgrade systems, which unlock new bits of story and improve your reputation with each of the three groups who have taken a marked interest in your progress. Doing so grants you perks that make the going a bit easier, like those that let you buy slightly better gear from the vendor, in case you find all your existing loot confiscated by the enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, despite some clear indications that some kind of plot will be included in Marathon even though multiplayer mayhem is plainly the focus, it’s still unclear to me how much that story will matter or deliver something that makes me want to progress, beyond just finding better weapons to use. As a mercenary called a Runner, your consciousness is repeatedly uploaded to a synthetic body and sent into dangerous territory in search of riches. Beyond this basic premise and some really cool details, like how your artificial bodies are sewn together out of synth silk by robotic caterpillars, there wasn’t a whole lot to go off of, and I could easily see this not being an area of particular focus for Marathon. That said, the world Bungie has built is every bit as beautiful as it is creepy and dystopian, and there are moments where they satisfyingly hint at the events of the Marathon trilogy from the ‘90s. But Bungie also told me that they’re not entirely following the events of the original games, and what little I saw did only slightly more than pay lip service to the world.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s the question of whether Bungie will add enough content at a fast enough pace to appease ever-ravenous players.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another question is just how much support and longevity we can expect from Marathon. Bungie has earned its reputation for mastering the live-service model over the past decade of Destiny, and shows no signs of letting players down here, as they told me they already have plans to support Marathon with new maps, weapons, characters, and more as they develop it, but as always, there’s the question of whether they’ll do so at a fast enough pace to appease ever-ravenous players. And importantly, Marathon also plans to use the seasonal reset model found in the likes of Diablo 4, where you’ll be stripped of your loot and progress at the end of each season to do so again with new content and a new meta to mix things up. While I could definitely see this working for Marathon, there’s always the question of how they’ll manage to incentivize making that arduous climb from scratch each season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing enough Marathon to get a pretty good feel for it in its alpha state, I’m already fairly confident it’ll scratch the Bungie PvP itch that’s been left unscratched for a number of years now. Here’s hoping they’ll knock it out of the park when it comes to PC and consoles in September.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

But even in more casual takes on the genre like <em>Call of Duty</em>’s shortly lived “DMZ” mode from <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> (2022), defeat often results in such an uphill battle in the next match that you’re usually too underequipped to be able to withstand even encounters with all but the most trivial AI, let alone fully equipped players. Many folks like this kind of a challenge, but it’s a niche crowd for sure. </p><p>But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">today’s gameplay reveal of <em>Marathon</em></a></span> shows perhaps the most casual and approachable take on the genre yet. As someone who deeply loves the thrill that comes with this kind of game, I’m hopeful Bungie’s take on this hardcore genre opens the door for more folks to enjoy its highs without getting too mired in the lows. </p><h2 id="h525805"><a id=""></a>A class-based structure makes all the difference</h2><figure id="" data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-recommend-id="image://2c84b988f542df25fab3ae3fc3e3c288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a threeway split of the Glitch, Locus, and Blackbird Runners." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As we learned from today’s gameplay reveal, players will select from one of six Runners at launch to jump into a map with. These sound very similar to classes in <em>Destiny</em> or even the abilities of characters in something like <em>Apex Legends</em> or <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. Today’s event showed off the four that will be playable during the game’s closed alpha period: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Locus</strong>: A soldier-type character that’s “all about push-forward gameplay,” described during the stream as “the first one in” during combat scenarios.</li><li><strong>Blackbird</strong>: A “reconnaissance-based” Runner who focuses on spotting enemy threats for the team</li><li><strong>Glitch</strong>: An speedy “disruptor” who encourages fast, get-in, screw-with-enemies, get-out tactics</li><li><strong>Void</strong>: A stealthy Runner who can use smoke grenades and even go invisible with active camouflage</li></ul><p>Players will be able to find various implants and “Cores” to spice up their Runners, but given the inherent traits of each runner, such as Glitch’s double jump and Locus’ deployable shields, it sounds like you’ll always be able to deploy into a match with a baseline of defensive and offensive capabilities. Another exciting ability is Blackbird’s Ultimate, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em> observed in their preview,</a></span> which basically lets you interrogate a downed enemy to reveal their teammates’ positions.</p><p>But perhaps most importantly, these class dynamics provide a bit of a script that players should ideally follow during a match. See a Locus? You know that character likely has superior firepower. See a Void? You’ll know to expect some sneaky shenanigans. You’ll also know that those are the roles you’re expected to fill for your team, and you’ll be able to opt into that role at the start of the match, not <em>after</em> you’ve acquired the necessary gear to play as a tank, healer, or any other meta role. This establishes a clear expectation of what you should be doing during the match aside from just gathering loot and getting out alive.</p><figure id="" data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Marathon promises more than just shooting and looting in its gameplay loop.</figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-recommend-id="image://7086602e36ee470764f3ffbea0ca5b38" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows a player highlighting enemy targets in a foggy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It also means that you’ll spend less time scavenging things from the map for the sole purpose of being able to fill those roles after you’ve died.

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s latest stab at a new genre, with the team attempting to break into the extraction shooter market. It’s a game set within a distant universe, with players controlling cybernetic soldiers fighting to survive across a variety of maps and environments.</p>



<p>The team revealed today that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha is lined up for the game</a>, set to take place in the next couple of weeks. That’s all well and good, but when it finally hits the market, will Marathon be free to play, or will it have a premium price tag?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marathon-price-guide">Marathon Price Guide</h2>



<p>Marathon is a sci-fi extraction shooter with more unique elements under the hood than the average player might realise. It’s an attempt from Bungie to disrupt the genre and challenge games like Escape from Tarkov, which have long held the top spot in the market.</p>



<p>It’s been widely speculated that Marathon will be a free-to-play title, however, in an announcement following the games reveal, that’s simply not the case.</p>



<div><p>Taking to the official X account, the Marathon account said, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-is-not-free-to-play-will-be-a-premium-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon will be a premium title</a>. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title.”</p><p>“We’ll announce details this Summer,” they continued.</p></div>



<p>It means that you will be expected to part with some cash in September, but as to how much is currently unclear. The going rumors suggest that the game will have a $40 price tag, but so far, no one has stepped forward with a concrete report. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-marathon-on">What Platforms is Marathon On?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The recently revealed alpha will be available across all platforms, and the full release will have crossplay and cross-save functionality.</p>



<p>How much will you pay for Marathon when it launches? Do you think Bungie have missed out on not making Marathon free to play? Let me know what you think in the comments, or check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-slick-looking-marathon-shooter-arrives-on-september-23rd.1162890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The creators of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny </em>are finally ready to show off their next big project: <em>Marathon</em>. It’s a long-awaited title from Bungie and revives the classic <em>Marathon </em>IP in the form of a PvPvE extraction shooter. After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter">teaser nearly two years ago</a>, the Sony-owned studio just spent an hour showing off <em>Marathon</em> gameplay and game mechanics and revealed the game will launch on September 23rd on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save. There’s even an alpha test for fans to try out the game later this month, ahead of its full debut this year.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, in the remains of Tau Ceti IV, which Bungie describes as a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions have hired Runners to scavenge for what’s left behind, and anyone who signs up to be a Runner has given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell with unique abilities and stats.</p><p>As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You can face rival runners in maps of up to 18 players, so up to six teams, in a bid to grab as much loot as possible and get out. While <em>Marathon </em>is designed to be played in crews, with contextual pings and shared objectives, you can also play solo instead of having to form a dedicated three-person team.</p><p>In <em>Marathon</em> runs, there will be what Bungie calls security forces, PvE enemies that roam the world. There are also creatures on these planets that are a threat when you’re navigating toward points on a map. You’ll have to choose whether it’s worth engaging with these enemies and risk revealing your location to rival teams or use a strategy of avoiding these threats in this PvPvE environment.</p><p>The maps are filled with bold and vibrant artwork and weapons, materials, and equipment that can be scavenged. Before a run, you build a loadout and select the Runner that fits your play style. In the alpha test, which starts on April 23rd, there will be four runners to choose from, including the stealthy Void character that can go invisible much like a Hunter from <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>There’s also a Glitch runner that has fast-paced abilities and, like its name implies, can glitch out enemies. If you’re more of a run-and-gun type of player, Locus has a shield ability and looks similar to the slide and shotgun play of a Titan from <em>Destiny 2</em>. The final runner in the alpha test is Blackbird, designed for recon and scanning the area around you. While there are four runners in the alpha test, there will be six to choose from when <em>Marathon </em>launches in September.</p><p>During its livestream, Bungie published a nearly 20-minute video of highlights from 40 creators it says it recently invited to try the game.</p><p>If you die, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up. Teammates can also revive you if you fail a mission.</p><p>Bungie isn’t putting a limit on team compositions, so that means everyone on a three-person team can select the same runner. There will be end-game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more.</p><p>Bungie has even produced an original short cinematic that’s set in the <em>Marathon </em>universe. Written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (<em>Love, Death, and Robots</em>), this nearly nine-minute short will have Bungie fans poring over it for days to discover every little detail about the <em>Marathon</em> universe.</p><p>While <em>Marathon </em>is very slick-looking, there’s a lot riding on this game. It’s entering a crowded market of shooters and live-service games that have tried and failed to break through in recent years. <em>Concord</em>, also from a PlayStation studio, was the biggest example of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">shooter that failed to take off</a> recently, forcing Sony to take the game offline less than a month after launch and eventually shut down the studio behind it.</p><p><em>Spectre Divide</em>, a <em>Valorant</em>-like free-to-play shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">also shut down</a> just months after its launch, with the developer behind the ambitious shooter shutting down, too. These high-profile failures add to the pressure that <em>Marathon</em> is already under on the back of Bungie’s success with <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em> and Sony’s ambitious live-service game effort that it has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled">scaling back recently</a>.</p><p>The <em>Marathon</em> alpha test will be an opportunity for Bungie to show the world exactly how its latest game will stand out from the competition, and whether it does enough to tempt people away from hero shooters or <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> into the extraction shooter genre that <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> has popularized.</p><p>The big question left for Bungie to answer is how much <em>Marathon</em> will cost. It’s not a free-to-play game, but the studio isn’t ready to talk about exact pricing just yet. <em>Destiny 2</em> is technically free-to-play with an optional season pass, but a lot of additional content requires payment for access to raids, dungeons, and even some of the story content. It’s been a confusing model for new players over the years, so I’m hoping Bungie lands on a clear pricing structure for <em>Marathon</em>.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>debuts on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC on September 23rd. You can sign up for the <em>Marathon </em>closed alpha test <a href="https://www.marathonthegame.com/">on Bungie’s website</a> or <a href="http://discord.gg/marathonthegame">on Discord</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reveals-marathon-gameplay-during-extended-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full gameplay reveal for Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon</a>, it’s been reported that the game will be a “premium” release that players pay for, but the exact pricing has not been made official yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-won-t-be-full-price-but-players-will-still-have-to-pay">Marathon Won’t Be Full Price, But Players Will Still Have to Pay</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon impressions piece</a> on GameSpot, Tamoor Hussain writer wrote that Marathon will launch September 23rd as a “premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price.” Hussain also confirmed that the game will feature a seasonal content model with its own battle pass, three maps at launch (a fourth coming later), and a persistent story.</p>



<p>Before players panic about having to pay $70 though, it’s already been reported that Marathon’s price point won’t be close to that figure. Forbes gaming writer Paul Tassi, who’s long covered Bungie and Destiny, <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated on X</a> that they’ve received confirmation that Marathon is not $70, and will be “not even close” to that number. The official Marathon account has since confirmed that the game will be a premium title, but not full-priced, and stated that more details would be announced in the summer.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Marathon will be a premium title. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title. 

We’ll announce details this Summer.</span></p></article></div>



<p>As Tassi wrote in an earlier post, releasing closer to $30 or $40 “of course still comes with its own risks.” Several players reacting to the reveal that Marathon won’t be free-to-play immediately are already making comparisons to Concord. Concord, a multi-player shooter released in 2024 as the debut game for Firewalk Studios, launched at a $40 price point for its standard edition. Sadly for Firewalk, the game received luke-warm receptions from critics, and failed to establish any sort of reliable player base. Within two weeks of launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game was shut down</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firewalk Studios was closed two months later</a>, in what’s considered one of the biggest launch disasters in gaming history.</p>



<p>While Bungie has the distinct advantage of a far more impressive track record to boast, Marathon will still face the same challenge: attaching a premium price point for a game that will compete in a saturated market of free-to-play titles.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-no-playstation-network-account-pc/">Bungie's</a> first new game in over a decade finally got its full reveal today. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/">Marathon</a>, a new extraction shooter that is actually a reboot of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/">very first game</a> Bungie released by the same name, had a big showcase featuring our first honest look at gameplay for the new shooter, and we also got the announcement for the release date.</p>
<p>Marathon will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on<strong> September 23, 2025</strong>, but if you're especially keen to try it out for yourself, you can sign up for a closed alpha test later this month by joining the game's <a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame">official Discord server.</a></p>
<p>The livestream showcase for Marathon included a panel of the game's lead developers, including game director Joe Zeigler, art director Joseph Cross, gameplay director Andrew Witts, and senior design lead Lars Bakken. Each talked about their experiences with Marathon, talking the game up between the short gameplay trailers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Trailers that do show off some Marathon gameplay, but none of them are as effective in showing what the game actually looks like in motion than a 20 minute video that shows highlights from Bungie inviting content creators and press to play the game. In that video you're watching a select few creator's direct gameplay feed, and we get a much better sense of what Marathon looks like when you're on stick.</p>
<p>We also got a bit more information on some of the core details of Marathon, like the four Runners that players can choose from: Void, Glitch, Blackbird, and Locus. Each runner comes with their own set of abilities that inform the playstyle you can go for with them, but you're not limited to what kinds of weapons and load-outs you can craft, so you're free to play how you like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Creator Alpha Gameplay Highlights" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlC31D_Rr-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The livestream showcase ended with a bit more information on Marathon's narrative, which will be told over seasonal updates as Marathon is a multiplayer-only game, with no dedicated single-player mode. That said, we also got confirmation that you can solo-queue in Marathon if you don't have two other people to play with to make a full squad of three or don't want to play with randoms.</p>
<p>Overall, Marathon doesn't look like it's doing much to distinguish itself from the already overcrowded genre of modern-day first-person shooters. Bungie's signature brand of first-person shooting and the game's art style certainly have a chance at making yet another extraction shooter feel fresh, but we'll have to wait until we actually get to play it to see if it has a chance at surviving. And that's without even mentioning the other elephant in the room, which is the fact that we still don't know what the final price of the game will be.</p>

The game hails from a genre—extraction  shooters—that’s never been for the faint of heart but from a big-budget studio that doesn’t do anything on the cheap.

But how many people will show up at launch for the studio behind <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em>?<em> Marathon</em>’s price will be a big factor there. The Sony-owned company still hasn’t said what the game will cost but it doesn’t sound like it will be free. </p><p> “The kicker here is that <em>Marathon</em> is going to launch as a premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports <em>GameSpot</em></a></span>’s Tamoor Hussain, who recently went hands-on with the shooter. “Based on what I experienced and was told, it’ll have a battle pass, three maps (with a fourth arriving shortly after launch); fun but no-frills gameplay; a story that currently is all very vague in its nature and unclear in its implementation; and a character-progression system that doesn’t yet show signs of offering a meaningful sense of growth.”</p><p>Charging $7o for what’s described above, as <em>Forbes</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Tassi notes</a></span>, seems out of the question, and Bungie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified that it won’t be doing</a></span> that stating, “<em>Marathon</em> will not be a full-priced title.” The most obvious guess from there is that <em>Marathon</em> will be $40. That seems to be the popular new hedge for premium games that need to reach a massive audience. That previously rumored number is what <em>Helldivers 2</em> was priced at last year. It’s also $10 less than what Bungie charged for <em>Destiny </em>2's big<em> The Final Shape</em> expansion that same year. </p><p>But $40 is also what Sony charged for <em>Concord</em>, the infamously failed hero shooter that so few people played that it was retroactively unreleased and fully refunded within two weeks of launch. A big talking point around that game was whether it would have had a better chance if it had been free-to-play, or at least free with PlayStation Plus. It’s impossible to know now, but that question will seemingly haunt every new live-service shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">releasing in <em>Concord</em>’s wake</a></span>.</p><p>At the same time, Bungie has never given its games away for free before. Even <em>Destiny 2</em>, which currently has a free version, locks most of its content, especially newer stuff, behind a premium paywall. And most fans can understand why. Games like <em>Destiny 2</em>, or <em>Marathon</em> for that matter, don’t come cheap. With blockbusters like<em> Spider-Man 2</em> needing to sell over 7 million copies just to break even, microtransaction shops alone are unlikely to pay the bill unless your live-service game becomes a <em>Marvel Rivals</em>-sized hit overnight. And honestly, <em>Marathon </em>is looking a little too hardcore for that at the moment. </p><p>But unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>Maratho</em>n is a PvPvE game seemingly without anything in the way of a traditional story-based campaign. It’s already working from within the confines of a more niche genre. In a world where most other PvP games are free-to-play, charging anything might be one step too far when it comes to getting players on the sidelines to come in and check out the newest project from the studio responsible for their favorite college dorm <em>Halo 3</em> party back in the day. </p><p>Bungie and Sony are likely banking on that lingering brand power to get people to show up on day one. Whether it’s enough to also get them to pay is another thing entirely. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-defector-404-media-hell-gate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It wouldn’t be Inside Baseball Week without a whole lot of navel gazing, but we cannot, in good conscience, keep this golden opportunity to self-importantly bloviate to ourselves. That’s why, this time around, we brought friends. On the latest, very special episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss the good, the bad, and the unprecedented of worker-owned media with pals from <a href="https://defector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a>, <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a>, and <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a>.</p><p>Our roundtable consists of Aftermath’s Nathan Grayson (that’s me!) and Riley MacLeod, Defector’s David Roth, 404 Media’s Emanuel Maiberg, and Hell Gate’s Max Rivlin-Nadler. We go deep on all sorts of topics: What was the hardest part of starting a publication in this mold? How did you know when you’d found your site’s voice? How do you collectively make decisions when everyone’s an owner? Who handles business stuff when everyone’s a writer (and, in Aftermath’s case, definitely NOT a businessperson)?&nbsp;</p><p>You think that’s all the questions we ask and answer? Much like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one Jonathan Frakes meme</a>, we’re just getting started: How do you promote the written word to a video-obsessed internet? And at what point do you, somebody who got into this business to be a journalist, have to transform yourself into at least a bit of an influencer? And perhaps most importantly, how can sites like ours work together to create a scene that provides opportunities to new voices as opposed to just cashing in on preexisting clout?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we get to the topic everyone’s really listening for: the awkward truth underlying podcast ad reads about people’s guts not working right.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy that shared video studio Roth mentioned and <a href="https://aftermath.site/1up-forum-posting-games-journalism-neogaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fulfill our destiny</a> of creating The 1UP Show 2.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> From [the mailbag]: “As writers for independent journalism outlets, and given infinity budget, what things would you want to have or support on your individual websites/outlets (Writers, writing, types of events, etc)?” So yeah, if you had infinite budget, what would you do?</p><p><strong>Max: </strong>We have wonderful lawyers who work for us pro bono, but I would file ten million FOIAs, and then the second the statutory limit hits, just unleash hell on the city. That would be really fun. I think it would yield some tremendous stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Better equipment is always good. I’d hire people. It goes more toward journalism. Just fill out that newsroom. Hire a bunch of people.</p><p><strong>Emanuel: </strong>[I’d] definitely hire people. We want to and I think will eventually end up doing a zine or a magazine or some kind of physical format for 404 Media. And then also, I think we will do this, but if we had infinite money, we could do it today: At Vice we worked on a lot of documentaries. I think that work is really good. It’s very expensive, but we’d love to get back into making high-production-value video.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>David:</strong> That is a great way to spend money. Though I don’t think video is the future of the internet, or at least, like–</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Do you maybe mean it’s not the <em>all-encompassing</em> future? Like, there are multiple futures for the internet, and video will only be part of it?</p><p><strong>David: </strong>Yeah, but if unlimited money means unlimited money, that shit’s fun to do. Doing fun, hard, high-production-value stuff would be amazing. Hiring more people would be amazing to be able to do. And then, if I personally had $100 million, I would love to have a studio space for use by people to do professional-quality stuff. The idea of trying to do it seat of the pants, we’ve done great with ours; we’ve worked with really awesome people and put out some great videos. It’s just so much harder to do that. So the idea of there being an actual, physical plant for indie journalism, I think, would be really meaningful. I feel like it would make a big difference.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think that would also lend itself naturally to collaboration between publications, because you’d have multiple people using it, they’d be around, they’d talk, they’d come up with ideas, and then you’d have more people doing little projects together – which I think would benefit sites in general.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Also, the idea of zero-interest loans to places. Basically, if you had $100 million and you could loan it out $1 million at a time to 100 different websites and basically be like “Tell us what you’re going to use it for, use it for that, pay us back.” No one’s getting rich off it, but that’s basically there to help take those big steps forward we were talking about that are hard to take when you’re living within your means. I would love that, but I don’t know who’s got that kind of money to spend who wants to spend it on blogs.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> If any viewers or listeners [or readers] have that kind of money and have been on the fence until now, <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now’s the time</a>!</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Should I buy the Pittsburgh Pirates, or should I get into the blog business?</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

		<p>Bungie have finally revealed their new version of Marathon, a team-based extraction shooter set on the world of Tau Ceti 4. While the gunplay looks classic Bungie the art style is bright and rather cartoonish with chunky 8-bit style fonts and glitching effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZRGDZCl9pg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will have up to eighteen players battling it out alongside AI enemies but while you can be in a team of three, you can opt out of matchmaking and play solo if you wish. The idea is to grab as much loot and escape, die and your loot will be dropped and claimed by someone else. More loots means a better loadout on the next run.&nbsp; The game will feature “events” which have yet to be detailed, dynamic weather, end game content, community events and seasonal stories. Each runner will have implants which you can use to enhance shields, agility and other abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

<p>Marathon will launch on September 23rd 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of Kiddy Apex Lege.. erm, I mean Marathon? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Almost two years after it was first revealed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> have released a first-look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot's gameplay. And you know what? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's looking really good! And it's out September 23rd! Much like the reveal trailer it's incredibly stylish, there's this clean, almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> like quality to its world, but we've had hints of that already. The big thing is the gameplay, which looks like more of that chunky, Bungie, first-person shooting goodness.

<p>
In terms of how matches work, you can form teams of up to three people as you head out to collect loot. Dying normally means losing any loot you've collected, but if you manage to get out successfully you can hang on to it for future runs. Matches can have up to 18 players, though it sounds like there won't necessarily be that many all the time, as you can even go solo if you like.

At launch there'll be six runners to choose from, but Marathon won't just be about the gameplay, as there'll be seasonal storytelling events too. Also, no idea why, but all of these details were delivered to us from Final Fantasy 16's own Ben Starr. Can't complain though, great voice!
</p>
<p>
The thing you'll probably most be interested in, though, is that the game is getting a closed alpha. This kicks off April 23rd and runs until May 4th, but there's a catch: it's for North America only. Perhaps a bit annoying for the rest of us, but I've never known gamers to be anything but a patient bunch. You'll have to join the game's official Discord to sign-up.
</p>
<p>
I'm really not much of a shooter person, they've never clicked with me honestly, but boy howdy does Marathon's sci-fi world look like it might change things for me. One concern I do have is that Bungie are obviously known for vaulting a large portion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s story - so much so it <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis">had to use fan made videos in a court case</a> to show off the game's story - that I can't help but wonder how they'll handle Marathon. I guess we'll find out in due time!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, you can watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlC31D_Rr-Y?si=GeF-7H49-3lRQSGk">highlight reel</a> of a bunch of YouTubers and Twitch streamers playing the game to get more of a feel of moment to moment gameplay. Just watch out for that Geoff Keighley jumpscare.

It was all narrated with incredible gravitas <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909708108282151044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909708108282151044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Balatro</em> clown Ben Starr</a></span> and culminated in a September 23 release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC with full cross-play. (Yes, <em>Marathon</em> is going <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044">head-to-head with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span>).</p><p>The top-level pitch is this: You play as a cybernetic mercenary called a runner who takes contracts to scavenge the remains of a lost colony on Tau Ceti IV. It’s PvPvE, so players will have to fight one another as well as AI-controlled UESC security forces and “otherworldly threats” to loot facilities and complete their objectives. If they successfully extract, they grow in power and new gear gets added to a vault to be taken out and used on the next mission, but if they get wiped on the surface everything gets left behind. There’s also a tease for higher-stakes gameplay aboard the derelict Marathon ship orbiting the planet, potential endgame content <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">that calls back to Bungie’s original trilogy by the same name</a></span> that suggests linkages that long-time fans will have fun unraveling.</p><p> The overall structure of <em>Marathon</em> sounds like it will be familiar to <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> players and fans of other extraction shooters, with some unique wrinkles. By default players will be grouped into squads of three but can also play solo, with up to 18 total appearing on a given map at once. Every match has its own time limit forcing players into action, and dynamic weather and other random events will add extra chaos to the proceedings. Any loot you extract with gets added to a vault to be used in future runs, though if it’s ever lost in a team wipe, it’s lost for good. </p><p>What about the moment-to-moment gameplay? The core of <em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s snappy and crunchy gunplay, which if it’s anything like<em> Destiny 2</em>'s will be top-shelf when it comes to first-person shooters, but with a bunch of new tactical and strategic elements to take into consideration given the battle-royale nature of the showdowns. Players are downed instead of immediately killed, and a revive system means death isn’t the end of a run. Bungie also said that “sponsored packages” from various corporate factions will give players a baseline loadout needed to stay competitive. </p><p>And of course there will be custom builds and abilities. We saw four different runner characters—Locus, Blackbird, Glitch, and Void—each with unique looks, playstyles, and abilities that can offer an extra edge. There will be unique stats for different characters, as well as customization when it comes to implants, cores, weapons, weapon attachments. A toxin upgrade by poison opponents, or players could equip something to boost their resistance to it. And Marathon will have it’s own version of Destiny’s rarest Exotics loot that offers the “best” version of a particular archetype. </p><p> The gameplay footage shows one sniper character turning invisible, similar to Hunters from <em>Destiny 2</em>, while equipment like grenades, shields, and medkits offer other characters different support roles. “You’re always free to experiment with team compositions, and the only limit to how you want to play your runner is your loot and imagination,” Starr’s narrator voice promises. It sounds like a lot to balance, and the proof will be in whether player experimentation proves to be truly viable, or if <em>Marathon</em> quickly coalesces around a narrow range of try-hard build-crafting metas.</p><p>Player progression will be another interesting test. Most of it will be account-wide rather than class-dependent, with faction ranks unlocking access to different upgrades and black market merchandise (all purchased with in-game currency) and completed contracts expanding vault space. Beyond the matches themselves, there are endgame challenges, ranked play, community events, and seasonal storytelling. Perhaps the most dramatic thing about <em>Marathon</em> is that it will largely reset players’ vaults at the end of each season to provide a more level playing field going into the next. It’s the logical thing to do for fairer play but might also be exactly the type of thing to turn off more casual fans. </p><p><em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s first new project in over a decade and its first new game as part of PlayStation, where the reported underperformance of <em>Destiny 2</em> led to multiple rounds of deep cuts in the last two years. (The previous game director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">was also fired in early 2024</a></span>). <em>Marathon</em> is facing an uphill climb for sure, especially a year after Sony’s other big live-service push, <em>Concord</em>, proved how brutal the multiplayer space is these days. But maybe Bungie’s extraction shooter will be more like <em>Helldivers 2</em>—infectious in its uncompromising focus on one hardcore gameplay loop. <em>Marathon</em> certainly <em>looks</em> like it has the juice. Hopefully, it ends up playing like it does too. A closed alpha test is set to begin on April 23.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bungie has revealed how Runners will work in Marathon, who they are, are what their class type does.</p>



<p>It’s been confirmed that their will be six individual ‘Runners’ on launch, with Bungie confirming four of them during the Marathon Gameplay showcase.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-runners-work">How Runners Work</h2>



<p>Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter, where the player will need to choose one of six (at launch) Runners to use. In the lore of the game, a Runner is a cybernetic mercenary who’s given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell. </p>



<p>The gist? Each of the Runners have their own unique abilities and attributes catering to different playstyles. The goal of the game is to scavenge the map for the best loot and extract.</p>



<p>Before you join a game, you’ll pick a Runner and build your loadout with the overall objective to get in, scavenge, and extract alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-runners-in-marathon">Who Are The Runners in Marathon?</h2>



<p>So far, Bungie has confirmed that there will be six different Runners coming to the game on launch, but they have only revealed four.</p>



<ul>
<li>Locus – Locus is the games “soldier” class who is suited towards players with a more aggressive playstyle.</li>



<li>Blackbird – Blackbird is the games reconnaissance Runner, who can find where players are and strategically plan your next move.</li>



<li>Glitch – Glitch is all about disrupting the enemy by pushing forward, compromising them (details to be determined) and getting out.</li>



<li>Void – Void is the games Stealth class, with active camo and the ability to throw down smokes.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s currently unclear on what the other two Runners in Marathon will be, but logic suggests that one will at least be some kind of healer, while the other could be some kind of Tank/Brute character.</p>

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s ambitious and energetic extraction shooter, poised to disrupt a relatively tired genre that has been dominated by a single game for far too long. The team at Bungie has worked tirelessly over several years to produce a remarkably unique title that might not look like a typical extraction shooter, but it definitely plays like one.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything we know about Marathon, including the game’s release date, gameplay loop, extraction shooter model, and when the closed alpha will take place.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marathon">What is Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>Marathon is a first-person shooter built around an extraction model</strong>. That means that players kit up, enter a map, and fight to survive against other players and AI enemies. They’ll complete tasks, loot items, and try to stay alive, as death means failure and the loss of everything they’ve acquired.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters are typically intense and very challenging, but Marathon will have a much more ‘arcade-style’ aesthetic and operating model. It’ll utilise fast-paced movement mechanics and powerful abilities to make it stand apart from the milsim extraction shooters we’re used to seeing.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s release date was revealed <strong>as being September 23, 2025</strong>. The price of Marathon hasn’t been confirmed just yet, but we know it’s not going to be free. It might cost something in the region of $40.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marathon-alpha">When is the Marathon Alpha?</h2>



<p>The Bungie team revealed that the <strong>closed alpha for Marathon starts on April 23, 2025</strong>. It’ll start as an invite-only event, with passes being allocated to specific users. From there, priority codes will be issued, and those who access the alpha will be able to invite two friends.</p>



<p>If you want to access the alpha, it begins with jumping into the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon Discord server</a> and completing a survey.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-coming-to-console">Is Marathon Coming to Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only released on PC platforms, but <strong>we already know that Marathon is coming to Xbox and PlayStation</strong>. This was known ahead of the grand reveal that took place on April 12.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-marathon-gameplay-look-like">What Does Marathon Gameplay Look Like?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s gameplay loop is typical for an extraction shooter. Players start their game up and load out as they see fit, equipping weapons, upgrades, shields, grenades, attachments, and more. They’ll pick a ‘Runner’, a cybernetic individual with unique perks and skills, and then they’ll pick a map.</p>



<p>From there, it’s a fight to survive, with players exploring the map they’ve chosen, trying to complete tasks and successfully win their fights to eventually get the chance to <strong>leave the map</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a deep dive into Marathon’s gameplay:</p>

                <p>Bungie's new shooter Marathon was the focus of a livestream event today in which the company shared lots of new information about it, including a release date.

Players take on the role of a "Runner," described as a cybernetic mercenary who is searching the world for "fortune and power." Playing in groups of three, players will face off against other groups of Runners, along with AI enemies. The goal, like in other extraction games, is to survive with scavenged materials and extract to safety, then doing it all over again.</p><p>Runners can be customized with different weapons, equipment, and "implants" that augment how they play. Teams will need to work together strategically to assemble their squads for the best chance of success.</p><p>As part of its Season 1 roadmap, Marathon will have endgame challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more, Bungie said.</p><p>Bungie also revealed a Marathon cinematic short written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (Tron: Uprising, Love, Death &amp; Robots). The cast in the cinematic short includes Erica Lindbeck as Glitch, Elias Toufexis as Void, Nika Futterman as Blackbird, Donnla Hughes as ONI, and Ben Starr as Narrator.</p><p>For lots more, be sure to read GameSpot's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">hands-on Marathon preview</a>.</p>

<section><p>Marathon feels like it'll deliver satisfying gameplay, but the experience around it could leave a lot to be desired</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I've been trying to distill my thoughts and feelings about playing Marathon into something easily communicable and I keep coming back to Season 6, Episode 13 of The Simpsons. In the episode, titled "And Maggie Makes Three," Homer learns that he's become a father for the third time and, in response, reacts with a despondent thumbs up that simultaneously acknowledges that something good has happened but that it also creates the potential for stress, hardship, and maybe even disappointment. I hate to reduce playing an alpha version of the next game from the team behind Halo and Destiny to a reaction meme deployed by millennials in group chats, but the accuracy of what homersadthumbsup.jpg conveys is undeniable.</p><p dir="ltr">After around eight hours of gameplay where I faced off against developers, content creators, and members of the press, I left Bungie's Bellevue studio keen to play more of its high-stakes PvPvE multiplayer game. And at the same time, I couldn't deny that I had serious concerns about the experience that its compulsive gameplay loop is couched within. Putting it plainly, I'm worried Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Even in its alpha stage, what made playing Marathon so compelling was immediately evident. It took just one match of running, gunning, looting, and extracting to identify that the core of the experience leverages Bungie's pedigree as a best-in-class first-person-shooter developer. As longtime Halo or Destiny players can attest to, there's a satisfying texture in the moment-to-moment gameplay that makes Bungie's games hard to put down. The satisfying thump of a melee kill or the glee that comes from sticking an enemy with a plasma grenade has carried Halo through multiple generations. And deep loot-based progression layered on top of that gives Destiny a gravitational pull that's hard to escape. Marathon has all that, but within the framework of an extraction shooter. For those not familiar, this is a relatively new flavor of multiplayer shooter that takes the thrills of PvP and marries it with the tension of battle royale to create a game about dropping in, grabbing resources, and then making it to an extraction point to get out with your goodies in a single life.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the individual components of the genre are familiar territory for Bungie, but what makes it appealing for the team is the highly engaging risk-versus-reward format that treads some new ground for the studio while also leaning into the PvP roots that helped make its name.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us, the opportunity of an extraction shooter really comes from two parts," said game director Joe Ziegler. "One is that we have a team that's very excited to build it, and we also have this idea of how do we create the next step of Bungie but also harken back to some of the PvP roots that Bungie originally had with Halo and things of that sort?</p><p dir="ltr">"We're also doing something quite crazy experimental, if you will. We're trying to build a service that's like a PvPvE game where we can do a lot of the cool storytelling things that Bungie really does, but do it in the context of a game where a lot of the content is driven by players interacting with one another. I think that nexus of things really makes us very excited to create this experience for players."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether Marathon represents a bold new future for Bungie remains to be seen, but at this stage I can confidently say that its gameplay sits comfortably in the genre, feeling familiar but not so much as to be derivative of its past works. The framing of the PvP is in line with most modern extraction shooter or battle royale games: Multiple teams of three spawn into a map that is filled with loot that's up for grabs. Some of it is crafting materials, some of it is weapons of various rarities, and some of it is items that are associated with quests or objectives relevant to the game in progress or the overarching progression system. Matches can take anywhere between a minute if you're unlucky/bad to around 20-minutes if you’re lucky/good. Your backpack space is limited, so there are decisions to be made about the balance between what to keep and what to leave behind. You can fill your pockets with things that will be valuable later or things that could be necessary to your objectives now. Loading up on guns, ammo, and items to keep in your vault might make future runs less of an uphill struggle, but if you can't get it to the extraction point because you didn't grab enough health or shield recovery items and got jumped, you're going to end up losing it all anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Tried-and-true shooting akin to Halo and Destiny is the bedrock of the game, while characters called Runners facilitate a variety of playstyles and team roles. Their various abilities are somewhat analogous to the skills and Supers employed by Destiny's Guardians or Apex’s Legends, but commonalities are more on a functional level than being impressive ways to live out a power fantasy. Marathon is much more grounded, and there's a weightiness to it that means it moves at a slower pace than its stablemates, which emphasizes the tactical flow that is intended to drive skirmishes. Movement is governed by a stamina meter that fills as you sprint and slide around, so things are a little more controlled--if you're expecting the floaty leaps or over-the-top abilities Destiny usually has, you're going to be disappointed.</p><p dir="ltr">Deliberate, grounded gameplay is crucial to the tension of most extraction shooters, and it serves that purpose in Marathon effectively. This, Bungie hopes, will reinforce the idea of making gameplay that feels different from its past games and creates moments that tell their own stories.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bungie is known for its very action-forward [gameplay]; that 30 seconds of fun is the phrase that's always been there with Halo and the extension of building your own superhero, if you will, with Destiny," explained gameplay director Andrew Witts. "For us, we're getting a little bit more into tactical action, which is something that Bungie's never dipped into. Part of that is that you have to introduce a little bit of friction, but good friction in a way where you want to get people to lean forward and feel the tension. In the past games, tension came from overwhelming odds, and this is overwhelming odds, but more from the intangibles of, 'Where is everything? I don't have the perfect information.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Ziegler added: "So much of it is driven from the pressure of the scenario. We think games become really meaningful, moments in games become meaningful, and the stories you tell become really meaningful when they have a certain amount of agency. You chose to do a bunch of things and then, the impact is really high. In some cases, some of the loops that we're trying to create really reinforce that idea of storytelling. For example, if you go in and play the game, you're really coming out going, 'This is my story. This is what happened to me and this is why it's cool because I overcame odds. I did this really cool thing and I got this unique story out of it that nobody did by surviving that session or by getting through the trials and tribulations of the session.' For us, that does mean going a little bit more tactful at times to make sure that the decisions that people are making have really clear consequences where it's like, 'Oh, I got destroyed by AI because I made the wrong move.'"</p><p dir="ltr">All of that bears out in the way the Runners are played. Although they have distinct abilities that are enabled by futuristic cybernetic technology, the impact of these are restrained just enough so that, when activated, they provide a small tactical advantage instead of enabling the user to bulldoze through enemies. Locus, for example, is essentially the vanilla soldier class. His abilities include launching shoulder-mounted missiles that home in on enemies to immobilize and do damage. He also has an energy barricade that can be held to block incoming damage but drains quickly when attacked. His movement ability is a short dash using boosters, and he has a faster sprint, which is regulated by the additional heat it generates. Of all the characters, Locus plays in the most predictable ways, but the alternative Runners don't mix things up significantly either.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout my playthrough, I found myself yearning for abilities that were a little more exciting. I don't need to soar into the sky and unleash a barrage of rockets or call in a sidekick named Bob to dish out some punishment when I hit a button, but everything I did in Marathon was very lacking in originality--again, closer to the character toolset from Apex Legends, which is well-trodden territory at this point. The upside of having Runners with relatively simple abilities, however, is the learning curve is very manageable, and it's very easy to understand what your enemies are capable of too. This, it turns out, makes the game much more approachable than its contemporaries, especially given how overwhelming other multiplayer games that have been running for years can be. For me, approachability is a key aspect of Bungie's games. Whether it's Halo or Destiny, the barrier to entry for gameplay is very low and, when it comes to getting to grips with mechanics, that looks to be the case for Marathon too. This is in contrast to the notoriously complex and finicky nature of most other extraction shooters.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think our ideal is that if you're really into PvP experiences and you really are excited by getting into the sandbox nature of play, this is an approachable way to enter that extraction shooter experience," Zeigler said. "Having said that though, is it more intense? In some ways, yes. It really depends on how you think about the Bungie audience.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to build, expand that audience into people who want to do some of these more survival-based, intense experiences, but not have to go through a lot of the finicky nature of what's being offered currently to make that happen. We are focused on approachability, definitely, but our approachability doesn't mean pulling from the depth of the experience, but more how we stage and remove some of the things from the front layers to get people to those really deep survival experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">"Approachability on the gameplay side of things is really about touchstones that people go, 'Okay, I know this roughly, this feels familiar,'" Witts continued. "That is a basis for people to learn versus just upfront obtuse mechanics. We're really trying to be recognizable and [have] the approach on that angle be one of 'I know Bungie games, what the base asks are, but this is very different in a way where it's demanding in this way or I have to take my time and be slow here and I can't just have push forward constantly.'"</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, in this early stage, it works. Marathon in its alpha phase is an extraction shooter that is easy to pick up and get into. It is satisfying to play and feels well made, as opposed to being eurojank held together by whatever the coding equivalent of gaffer tape is.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr">I trust Bungie to make good on its ideas and realize its ambition in some form or another. Despite its rocky start, Destiny reached a much better place after the hard work put in to build on what was there.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In a genius move, each map in Marathon is also populated by AI-controlled robots that can be mowed down as you do your business and occasionally run into human opponents. This means that, even if you're not great at PvP, you are able to do the point-and-shoot stuff that feels good and gain experience and, hopefully, build the confidence to keep playing and getting better. Other games have these fodder-type enemies too, but what elevates Marathon's is their behavior. Bungie is known for creating foes that are an actual challenge and, if you're playing on higher difficulty, might even take you down. The same can be said of Marathon's roving AI enemies, who will run up on you, take cover, move between points, and even use high ground to get an advantage. Some of them, like the Commanders, can be deadly if not taken seriously, so I'm not ashamed to say that I got overwhelmed by them and team-wiped a few times during my sessions. For experienced players, the difference between AI and human is obvious, but for many the line between them won't really matter since they push back enough to make you feel like you earned the kill. The enemy behavior and the way they're used to boost confidence and build momentum for the player is genuinely one of the most impressive parts of Marathon.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major contributor to Marathon's polished exterior is its arresting visual aesthetic. It's easy–and accurate–to describe it as having a futuristic, techy feel with cool-looking, robotic humanoid characters that also look like they're part-time fashion designers, but there's a style and cohesion to it that is unique. Bungie used a lot of phrases to describe what they were going for, my favorites being "cyber simplicity" and "future less" because they really speak to an aesthetic that is built around being antithetical. Marathon is a bright and vibrant game that uses simplicity as its north star and graphic design as the basis for its visual language. It's visually busy and dense, but at the same time, easy to digest and appreciate; high-fidelity, low-poly industrial design, is what they call it. The Runners, meanwhile, have these eye-catching details and flair that give them personality, and it's inspired by sports fashion. Again, Bungie's own description is the most apt: Nike meets Teenage Engineering. Using my decidedly less eloquent approach: It looks kinda like if Metal Gear, Armored Core, and WipeOut had a baby. Don't ask me how three participants have one baby--it's the future; you figure something out.</p><p dir="ltr">Needless to say, every new screen is a visual feast of cool icons and 3D-printed-looking objects. And Perimeter, one of the two maps we played, has a kind of neon industrial vibe that reminded me of Mirror's Edge. It looks so good that when we switched to Dire Marsh, where a thick fog would occasionally roll in, it was a little annoying. Mostly because all the nice visuals were being covered up, but also because sneaky players used it as cover for jumpscares, leading to quick kills.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon makes a great first impression but, very quickly, what's not there becomes as impactful as what is. Having praised the gameplay extensively, I have to pivot and also point out that everything it is doing is very ordinary, but executed well. Although I enjoyed playing the game, it was very evident that it didn't have a hook; a special something that will help it stand out from the crowd; an X-factor that gives it a fighting chance in a crowded world of multiplayer games that demand all of your time and attention. I wouldn't go so far as to say it felt soulless, but it definitely felt like something was missing, that one more ingredient to bring it all together. Without that, numerous other games popped into my head as more exciting prospects. Admittedly, most of those games aren't extraction shooters, but when it comes to making commitments, I have to assume a large portion of the intended audience isn't going to make that distinction, so why should I? Ultimately, regardless of genre, Marathon will be competing for the same time and attention that people have given, and are still giving, to Overwatch, Apex Legends, Warframe, Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, The Division 2, Valorant, Destiny, Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, Call Of Duty, Counter-Strike, and many others. Those are games that people have hours, days, months, and years of investment in, so it's going to take something special to make them even consider switching or splitting attention, let alone pull them away. As it stands, I don't think Marathon currently has that.</p><p dir="ltr">What it does have is ambition. Repeating Ziegler's words from earlier: Marathon is being built as "a service that's like a PvPvE game where we can do a lot of the cool storytelling things that Bungie really does." None of that, however, was evident in what I played. And various other parts of the game that were highlighted as being key to Marathon, its appeal, and its longevity were ideas we didn't get to see firsthand. It was a lot of tell with very little show.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon takes place in Tau Ceti IV in the year 2893, when a cryptic message from the planet's colony causes panic. The Unified Earth Space Council is doing its best to keep the details of what happened to the colony a secret, but whatever happened has led to Runners--people who are essentially transferring their consciousness to external shells--to exploit the resources on the planet. Players will uncover secrets of the universe and what happened on Tau Ceti IV. I know that because Bungie told me, not because I saw any indication of it in-game. The narrative in-game manifested in a Faction system, where the player can take contracts from one of six groups that are vying for power? Control? Resources? I'm not quite sure. This is ostensibly a progression system where the contracts ask the player to complete objectives during a run and, in return, curry favor with the faction to build up a rank and, eventually, unlock upgrades that marginally improve things like how long it takes to decode items from loot boxes and death boxes. Each of the three factions had a very brief history about what their deal is, but beyond that there was little to dig into. As a taster of a metagame that feeds into character progression, it felt very detached from the character I was creating and the world I was in.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Bungie, each faction will have their own narrative mystery, but at this stage said narrative mystery wasn't there–beyond completing objectives, there was no other way to engage with the faction. It also seemed like I could work for multiple factions with no consequence. But whatever is going on will be explored in games, and the player will have a hand in shaping events, though I'm not clear how and, when I asked, I left thinking it involved having special items.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of the later contracts actually have interactive VO that is piped into you as it's happening and they have a little bit more intricate requirements for the contract as you're going through it," explained Zeigler. "The missions become harder and also, you feel a little bit more of the presence of the narrative being told around you. We have other elements, which are for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're working on a system that's more about collecting things and then, as you finish a collection, you get a bit of lore like a clue in the season to actually help you understand that.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing we really wanted to tie storytelling into is we didn't want the storytelling to dominate the player's experience, but to complement their own stories as they're telling it. There's things that are more related to what we called for a while, a digital detective strategy, which is the idea it's more about you going out there finding loot in the world, how does some of that loot help you tell the story that you want to, how do we create the context for you to tell the stories that you're going to be having of surviving that session rather than being no, everyone's playing a campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">"Part of our season model is actually to make it so as you're having these adventures and there are things that you are earning and commemorating at an account level. Some of which are achieved by you doing some crazy things with friends or things of that sort that unlock things, potentially cosmetics or things of that account level that will stay with you throughout the time.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea is every season should be a moment to go on adventures, commemorate them, and then, some of those commemorative elements you can use as expressive elements for yourself in the future, whether they be skins or titles or things like that as a new season starts--a new opportunity to go on a new adventure. Part of the burden on us in terms of thinking about the service is to make sure every adventure that every season offers is in and of itself different and feels different to create those new stories."</p><p dir="ltr">Again, this sounds potentially interesting to me as a certified item-description reader--but "potentially" is the operative word. I can't help but think back to the launch of Destiny, when the story was threadbare and explored via Grimoire Cards accessible outside of the game itself. And without any concrete narrative hooks visible in what I experienced of Marathon, it's hard to get excited about a major part of why I enjoy Bungie's games.</p><p dir="ltr">Witts continued: "We're taking some pretty big swings for what the middle and end of the season looks like and we're already starting to think about what's happening in the world? What are some consequences? How does that manifest into the decisions that players can make, interesting ways on the mercenary fantasy and all the different ways that happens? Am I just getting something and getting out? Am I trying to take out a specific enemy? Things like that and that add to more fidelity and choice."</p><p dir="ltr">The kicker here is that Marathon is going to launch as a "premium" product, although Bungie said it will not be a "full-priced title." Exactly what "premium" means remains to be seen, as Bungie will reveal more at a later time. Based on what I experienced and was told, it'll have a battle pass, three maps (with a fourth arriving shortly after launch); fun but no-frills gameplay; a story that currently is all very vague in its nature and unclear in its implementation; and a character-progression system that doesn't yet show signs of offering a meaningful sense of growth. Maybe it's there behind-the-scenes and will be ready for launch, but for whatever reason, a decision was made not to show it.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, I'd be remiss not to once again point out that this is an alpha build (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/" data-ref-id="1100-6530808">you'll be able to try it soon too</a>), so it could all be implemented in the period leading up to launch. But at the same time, Bungie's own language indicated that much of what surrounds Marathon's core gameplay hasn't been formed yet or won't come together until much later, or is subject to change. In most of our discussions, there was a very loose commitment to ideas and direction. By its own admission, the project has changed in significant ways over the years of development and that fluidity is part of the process but, for me, there was a concern about how defined and settled the vision for Marathon is. I can't pretend to know how game development works, but at the very least I think I can say it felt like there's a whole lot to do and not a lot of time to do it before its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/" data-ref-id="1100-6530810">September release</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475097" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475097"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475098,1300-4475099,1300-4475100,1300-4475101,1300-4475102,1300-4475103,1300-4475104" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Either way, I trust Bungie to make good on its ideas and realize its ambition in some form or another. Despite its rocky start, Destiny reached a much better place after the hard work put in to build on what was there. Similarly, Destiny 2's ups and downs also brought with them incredibly memorable characters, stories, and moments. The gameplay of both games also evolved as time went on to become more intricate and engaging. Bungie has repeatedly shown a dedication to its games, so with that in mind, I am excited about where Marathon <em>could</em> go.</p><p>But there's also a graveyard filled with short-lived games-as-a-service titles that failed to capture the attention of an already-committed audience. And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">lately</a> big-budget titles from well-funded, high-profile teams have unfortunately made it there too. Like it or not, there are certain things that players already have and expect from similar titles, if they are to find a place in their gaming lives. In a world of free-to-play titles, a full-priced game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie.</p><p><em>This story has been updated to note that Marathon will not be a "full-priced title."</em></p>

<p>Bungie has revealed an upcoming closed alpha for Marathon, an all-new and ambitious extraction shooter that effectively reboots a 1994 game. Bungie uncovered it a couple of years back but has been mostly silent since – until now. The team started posting teasers on social media in the last few days, all leading up to this announcement.</p>



<p>Alongside the reveal of the impending closed alpha, prospective fans got a much-needed glimpse of the game via a new trailer.</p>

<p>Marathon has been a long time coming, and from what we’ve seen in early gameplay materials (such as the new trailer), it’s trying to be as innovative and unique as possible. The extraction shooter genre is a tough one to crack, given the dominance held over the vertical by games like Escape from Tarkov, but Bungie is giving it a fair crack.</p>



<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">key details of Marathon’s gameplay</a> loop, many of which have now been cemented by this new trailer.</p>



<p>The game will operate primarily with a trios-based model, with 18 players occupying each of the three maps (at launch). Once the game has hit the market, a fourth map will be released, appropriately named ‘Marathon’.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>

<p>Fans of the extraction shooter genre will be right at home with Marathon. All it takes is to gear up and become a Runner, entering the world of Marathon and trying desperately to survive the colourful but very dangerous world.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-marathon-alpha">How to Access Marathon Alpha</h2>



<p>To get access to the Marathon closed alpha, you’ll need to be invited by Bungie.</p>



<p>This all begins with accessing the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon Discord server</a> and completing a survey.</p>



<p>If you can secure a priority code, the team has advised that even they don’t guarantee access and only <strong>increase </strong>your chances of getting in.</p>



<p>It’s a somewhat limited closed alpha that will function better for those playing in North America – PlayStation codes are region-locked to North and South America.</p>



<p>If you’re able to receive a code, you’ll then be given two codes to invite friends to the platform.</p>



<p>The Marathon closed alpha will start on April 23, and all participants will be under a strict NDA.</p>
