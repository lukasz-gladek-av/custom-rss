Best Buy is <a href="https://howl.me/cmEnZjZvE2J">currently accepting orders</a> for the limited edition console for $209.99 ahead of its September 26th release date. You’ll still have to purchase <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>separately, but the special edition console does include a 12-month individual subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack (a $49.99 value).</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="jI1nRz" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://howl.me/cmEnZjZvE2J">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->210</span></p><p>The Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition is identical to the standard model, only it sports a swanky black-and-gold color scheme. It also features the Hylian crest on the back and comes with a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.</p></div><p>The console comes dipped in a golden hue with black trim — an iconic combo befitting Hylian royalty. The noble house’s signature crest graces the rear, and you’ll find a smaller Triforce symbol stamped on the front in the lower-right corner. There’s not much more setting it apart from any other Switch Lite, but considering <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is the first <em>Zelda</em> title to actually star Princess Zelda as the primary character, the occasion may move you to pick it up even if you already own Nintendo’s dedicated handheld.</p><p>Nintendo’s premium subscription tier, meanwhile, provides access to online play, cloud-based saves, and the ability to play older classics from the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, NES, SNES, N64, and even the Sega Genesis eras. This includes heralded <em>Zelda</em> titles like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, </em>and<em> The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. Needless to say, it’s a great way to revisit the series’ roots whenever you’re feeling nostalgic.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Join Starfy, his sister Starly and his gruff best friend Moe for a swimmingly slapstick trilogy of games full of vibrant <a title="Genres > Action [2,001 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, all originally available on the Game Boy Advance system:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy</em></strong> – No sleep ’til Pufftop! A sudden storm has caused Starfy, prince of the floating sky kingdom Pufftop, to plummet from his lofty home into the sea below. Luckily, he is rescued by an old lobster named Lobber who sets the adorable hero on a grand journey back to Pufftop. The way home is full of dangers, though, and Starfy will need to employ a variety of abilities— including Star Spin and Glide—and vehicles like the mighty Mole Tank, to overcome the challenges that await. The legend begins here!</li><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy 2</em></strong> – Help Starfy save his mother and bring peace back to Pufftop Kingdom in this action-packed sequel! Ogura—the villain of the first game—is back to seek vengeance against Starfy, and this time he has Mama Star in his sights. The revenge-driven ruffian ransacks Pufftop and steals away Starfy’s mother in the ensuing kerfuffle, leaving Starfy no choice but to dive head-first into his next adventure. With his best friend Moe in tow and challenges aplenty to face, Starfy has his work cut out for him.</li><li><strong><em>Densetsu no Starfy 3</em></strong> – Starfy’s sister Starly joins him and Moe for their third adventure on Game Boy Advance! Discover the truth behind the mysterious villain that’s been pulling Ogura’s strings all this time and put a stop to their nefarious plans once and for all. Spin and float with the starry siblings and save the day across action-filled stages with the help of familiar friends, including… Wario?! You read that right: Wario crosses paths with Starfy and Starly to help them through the Undersea Ruins in Stage 8 (while hunting for treasure, of course), so be sure to check it out. Go, Starfy and Starly, go!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-is-up-for-preorder-at-best-buy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is the first time it's available here in the States</h2></div><div><section><p>Apparently it's not too late for Nintendo to be releasing new editions of their Switch Lite console. Right now Best Buy is offering preorders of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPbmb?object_uuid=3a83581a-b47a-47bc-a348-f3a3b529e93e&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Lite: Hyrule Edition</a> handheld console for $209.99 with orders shipping out on September 26. That's $10 more than a stock Switch Lite, but that's more than justified by the fact that this edition includes a 12 month Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. The membership alone costs $49 and for most people, Switch Online is well worth the price of admission. Currently only Best Buy has it in stock, unless for whatever reason you prefer to purchase it from an overseas vendor. </p><h2>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition Console</h2><div id="203239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Preorder the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h3></p><div><p>Includes 12-month Switch Online membership + Expansion Pass</p></div></div><p>The Switch Lite Hyrule Edition was announced during the June 18 Nintendo Direct alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. We originally saw it available <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk">overseas in the UK</a>, but this is the first time we've seen a vendor here in the United States offer one up for preorder. This particular edition is adorned in a gold colorway very similar to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-limited-edition-oled-nintendo-switch">Switch OLED Hyrule Edition</a>. It is a gorgeous metallic finish that looks even better than in the photos. Aside from the tiny Triforce logo, the front of the case is free from any busy embellishments. The rear sports a single large embossed Hyrule Crest. It's all tastefully done and the best looking Switch Lite so far.</p><h3>Differences between the Switch Lite, Switch and Switch OLED</h3><p>The Switch Lite's major draw is that it's $100 less expensive than the Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It's compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite is that (1) the controllers are not detachable, (2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV and (3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third party wireless Switch controller, and you can still play untethered.</p><h3>12 months of Switch Online membership Are Included</h3><p>The bundle includes a 12 month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Switch Online</a> membership. You will absolutely need this if you plan on accessing the online portions of your favorite games. That includes being able to play online against other opponents in Super Smash Bros Ultimate or Splatoon 3, downloading other people's creations in Minecraft or Mario Maker 2, or visiting someone else's island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p>Other perks include access to the NES, SNES and Game Boy emulator libraries, which include classic games like Super Mario Bros. 3, F-ZERO and Donkey Kong Country. You'll even be able to play these games offline for up to seven days after you last logged into your Nintendo Switch Online account. Members also get access to exclusive deals and offers at the eShop, cloud saving, and access to the NSO mobile app.</p><h3>You also get the Switch Online Expansion Pack</h3><p>Here's a rundown of what's included with the bonus expansion pack:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Classic Nintendo 64 games</li><li>Classic Game Boy Advance games</li><li>Classic SEGA Genesis games</li><li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course pass</li><li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise access</li><li>Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion access</li></ul><p><em>Looking for more Switch Lite deals? </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-of-2024-ends-before-prime-day"><em>This Switch Lite bundle</em></a><em> includes Animal Crossing: New Horizons for only $159. You better hurry, because it expires tonight.</em></p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 11, 2024 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<article role="article" about="/tabletop/news/starscape-sci-fi-rpg-about-found-family-on-spaceship-was-fully-funded-day-one-on">
<div>
<div><p>Recently, Golden Lasso Games launched a Kickstarter campaign for their latest tabletop project. The project was <em>Starscape</em>, a sci-fi TTRPG heavily inspired by themes of found family. It was fully funded the same day it went live.</p>
<h2>The Starscape Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goldenlassogames/starscape"><em>Starscape</em></a> is a TTRPG that uses the Powered By The Apocalypse RPG system. The game is inspired by episodic sci-fi television shows, citing <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Farscape</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, and <em>Babylon 5</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starscape-crew-making-planetfall-artwork.jpg?itok=vu-dmvrz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starscape-crew-making-planetfall-artwork.jpg?itok=Lx1wS2bw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game's setting follows a similar format. The players are crewmates on a starship, which they slowly make into their home as they travel the galaxy. Whether exploring planets, infiltrating space stations, or fighting with outlaws, their ship is their foundation and their shipmates are their second family.</p>
<p>The <em>Starscape</em> core rulebook contains over 200+ pages of original rules and playbooks. These include playbooks for different kinds of ships, ten different character archetype playbooks, a step-by-step Session Zero world creation process, and an economy where players trade, earn, and wager Trust.</p>
<p><em>Starscape</em> was a four-year-long passion project by writer and designer Kimi Hughes. She got the idea for the game during the COVID-19 lockdown after recently becoming a mother. Isolated from the rest of the world full of uncertainty and fear, she found hope through binge-watching <em>Star Trek</em>. This game is the result of that nostalgia trip.</p>

This includes character artist Carlos "Kaek" Eulefi (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/backroads-bringing-southern-gothic-horror-to-table" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Backroads</em></a>), cover artist&nbsp; Bryan Vectorartist, layout designer Bora Haxhirai (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everyday-heroes-rpg-book-rambo-total-recall" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Heroes</em></a>), and editor Jaye Elsinger (<em>Horror Beneath The Frost</em>).</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign's stretch goals are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Planet for $20:</strong> A PDF of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Moon for $30:</strong> A PDF and physical softcover copy of the core rulebook</li>
<li><strong>Comet for $45:</strong> PDF, physical copy, and adventure supplement written by Kimi Hughes</li>
<li><strong>Star for $60:</strong> A hardcover deluxe edition of the core rulebook and PDF</li>
<li><strong>Supernova for $75:</strong> Hardcover deluxe edition, PDF, and adventure supplement</li>
<li><strong>Pulsar for $100</strong>: The deluxe hardcover core rulebook, PDF, adventure supplement, and a set of Starscape-themed dice</li>
<li><strong>Nebula for $250:</strong> Everything from the Pulsar tier, a Kickstarter-exclusive gilded hard cover copy of the core rulebook, and a seat at one-shot adventure</li>
<li><strong>Galaxy for $500:</strong> Everything from the Nebula tier, and having Kimi Hughes GM a one-shot of Starscape for your table</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Starscape</em> has raised&nbsp;$14,757, fulfilling its initial funding goal of $12,000. The campaign concludes August 8.</p>

The sequel, <a href="https://www.frontier.co.uk/news/press-releases/ride-wave-much-anticipated-planet-coaster-2">coming this fall</a>, will finally let you construct everything from wave pools and lazy rivers to custom-built waterslides.</p><p>You’ll also get to outfit your aquatic experience with changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more. <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> builds upon its predecessor with the addition of new building and pathing tools, as well as an advanced event sequencer system that can give your guests new experiences. There are also new rides, scenery pieces, and themes.</p><p>Another neat feature coming to <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> is the ability to create shared theme parks with friends — but you can’t all build in the park at the same time. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2688950%2FPlanet_Coaster_2%2F">The developer says</a> you can “jump one-at-a-time” into a shared park and then “save your progress to allow your fellow thrill-seekers to build upon your changes,” which is a bit of a bummer.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Frontier Developments</cite></p></div><p>Just like its predecessor, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> will come with three game modes: career, sandbox, and challenge mode.

            <p>
If you just can't get enough of those Epic Games Store freebies, here're some more for your list; Epic has revealed an upcoming twosome of arcade management action and Welsh folklore horror when its latest batch of free titles arrives next week. And, before that, grid-based, turn-based deckbuilder Floppy Knights is currently available to download and keep for zero pee.
</p>
<p>
Starting in the present, Rose City Games' <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/floppy-knights-6a735a">Floppy Knights</a> casts players as Phoebe, a brilliant young inventor with a robotic arm for a best friend, who's trying to save up enough money to leave home. To meet her goal, Phoebe must smash through armies of monsters using her titular tangible projections, all summoned from floppy disks. The result is a mix of tactical turn-based battling and deckbuilding that Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/floppy-knights-is-an-irresistible-mix-of-advance-wars-and-deckbuilding-1">said</a> "oozes fun, plain and simple",  back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Floppy Knights is free to download and keep on the Epic Games Store right now, and will remain so until next Thursday, 18th July. After that, two more freebies take its place:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise</li>
<li>The Maid of Sker</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nosebleed Interactive's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arcade-paradise">Arcade Paradise</a> is a sort of hands-on, first-person management game challenging players to turn their family's run-down laundrette into a thriving arcade. Your time is split between keeping the laundrette running - manually collecting trash, washing and folding clothes, unclogging the toilet, and so on - in order to scrape together the cash needed to buy new arcade cabinets and expand your empire. Which is where you'll spend the rest of your time: messing around with Arcade Paradise's 35 fully playable arcade games (with more available as DLC). Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">liked Arcade Paradise a lot</a>!

<p>
As for <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/maid-of-sker-2ae24e">The Maid of Sker</a>, it's a Welsh-folklore-inspired slice of stealth horror that tells the supposedly true tale of Elizabeth Williams, who's said to have have died of a broken heart after being locked inside her home by her controlling father. The action picks up in 1898 when players must explore the shadowy halls of Sker Hotel, sneaking about the place to avoid a cult of enemies that react to sound. Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maid-of-sker-review-an-effective-if-unadventurous-slice-of-rural-horror">lukewarm on this</a> when it released in 2020, calling it an "effective if unadventurous slice of rural horror". So there you go.</p>
<p>
To recap, The Maid of Sker and Arcade Paradise are next week's freebies (yes, I totally got muddled up first time around), and Floppy Knights is free now - just remember to claim it before Thursday, 18th July, when it's all change.

                <p>Mining is an important part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, as it offers a great way to make a ton of money and is necessary for upgrading your tools and crafting important machines. Because mining is so important, it makes the decision between the two skill paths, Miner and Geologist, that much more difficult. Unlike the choice between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-you-choose-rancher-or-tiller-in-stardew-valley/1100-6524885/" data-ref-id="1100-6524885">Tiller and Rancher</a>, the answer is a little less obvious.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Miner or Geologist</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Miner path is better for making money, but the Geologist path can help you complete the Museum collection faster.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Miner increases the number of ore (copper, silver, gold, and iridium) by one piece per vein. This is a relatively substantial boost, since it's guaranteed to give the extra ore. This makes it easier to upgrade tools in the early game and lets you stockpile materials early on. The level 10 skill options are Blacksmith, which makes Metal Bars worth 50% more. That means Iridium bars sell for 1,500G and the late-game Radioactive Bars sell for 4,500G. The other skill is Prospector, which doubles the amount of Coal found. Obviously, the Blacksmith skill is significantly better than the Prospector skill.</p><p dir="ltr">Geologist adds a 50% chance for gems to spawn in pairs and it applies to Geodes found from breaking rocks. The level 10 skill Excavator doubles the chance to find Geodes, in addition to the chance for them to appear in pairs. With this skill you can easily get a triple digit amount of Omni Geodes from a single Skull Cavern run, which can be exchanged at the Desert Trade for Artifact Troves, which have a chance to contain some of the rarer Museum artifacts.</p><p>Ultimately, the <strong>Miner path is more profitable in the long run</strong>, but there are benefits to following the Geologist path. You can change skills at the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the Sewers for 10,000G per skill.</p>

                <p>At level 5 of each skill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> you will be offered two skill options, specializing you in a certain aspect of that skill. One of the most important is the <strong>Rancher or Tiller</strong> choice at level 5 farming, since farming is such a large part of making money is Stardew Valley. One option focuses on animals, while the other focuses on crops. Here's what you should pick depending on how you play Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rancher or Tiller</h2><p><strong>In most cases Tiller will provide a larger boost to your profits and offers better level 10 skill options</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rancher provides a 20% boost to the sell price of animal products, both raw, like eggs and milk, and processed, like cheese and mayonnaise. Tiller increases the sell price of all crops by 10%, which only applies to crops and not foraged plants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331790"></a><figcaption>At level 5 you will have to choose a profession, but you can change it later for fee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331790-rancherortiller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are two major reasons why Tiller ends up being better. First, most players won't have many animals, if any, by the time they reach level 5, assuming they are growing crops every season. While the 20% boost is larger, the amount of animal products you are selling is likely much lower than the amount of crops you are shipping every season. The second reason is that the level 10 skills are better for the Tiller than the Rancher.</p><p dir="ltr">The first Rancher level 10 option is <strong>Coopsmaster</strong>, which decreases egg incubation time, makes it easier to befriend coop animals, and increases the likelihood of the coop products being high quality. The second option is Shepard, which causes sheep to produce wool faster, makes befriending barn animals easier, and increases the likelihood of barn animal products being high quality. Both of these options reward you for focusing on either of the two animal types, but one of the level 10 Tiller options offers a much bigger boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The first option for Tiller level 10 is Agriculturalist, which increases the growth rate of all crops by 10%, which is the worse option of the two. The better option is Artisan, which increases the selling price of all artisan goods by 40% (except oil). This applies to not only pickled crops, but crops that have been turned into wine. But the <strong>biggest benefit here</strong> is that processed animal goods, like cheese, mayonnaise, and cloth, are all considered artisan goods and benefit from the 40% boost.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of the Artisan skill, Tiller is the superior choice. If you want to try the other option, the <strong>Statue of Uncertainty</strong> in the sewers allows you to change skills for 10,000G per skill change.</p>

Many expected characters from the base game to return in some way, react to the events of the expansion, or simply play a bigger role in it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">especially ones who have close ties to Miquella</a></span>, the DLC’s central character<em>. </em>The lack of consequence, and the absence of new dialogue that’d further the player’s understanding of the story, have been a sore point for folks who are starved for morsels of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s massive, sometimes inscrutable narrative.</p><p>There’s a contingent of folks who are especially disappointed in the final cutscene of the DLC, feeling that it does very little to pay off the experience that preceded it. That sentiment is likely bred from the fact that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>ends in a <em>massive</em> fight. I’m talking, like, a <em>huge </em>pain in the ass that is even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">rigged against the player thanks to insane hitboxes</a></span>, seemingly unavoidable attacks, and the kinds of long combos that <em>Elden Ring </em>has become infamous for doubling down on. Once you have beaten that absolute unit of a final boss, there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene</a></span> that can be triggered, and many fans of the game are none too pleased with its brevity and lack of <em>oomph</em>, for lack of a better word.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree’s </em>ending follow.</strong></p><p>For many, this ending to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s saga seems like a whimper rather than a triumphant bang. The scene is straightforward enough (or as clean-cut as FromSoftware’s esoterica can be) and that appears to be the source of the tension. Miquella, the quintessential character of the entire expansion, appears for the first time and effectively doubles down on his goal, or at least restates it. There is no pomp to the affair. Miquella is kneeling throughout the scene, which takes place in a void save for the nearby throne of the Elden Lord, and it is over before you know it. It betrays no significant new insight.</p><p>I won’t lie: this <em>does </em>kind of suck ass. I actually get the contingent who were maybe expecting more from the end of this DLC. <em>Elden Ring </em>is an epic, and if this is the end of it, yeah, it’s not exactly what I would’ve expected. But while some are fixated on the short nature of the ending, others are pissed because of how little it appears to add to the story, or at the least their understanding of it all.</p><p><em>Elden Ring</em>, like most of FromSoftware’s oeuvre, is fascinating to digest and think about. I love people who sniff out bits of lore and propose theories about the motivations of characters and the larger schemings of the world. I too have fallen asleep to many Vaatividya videos piercing together scraps of item descriptions into a cogent and deeply tragic narrative. However, these practices have also borne a kind of fan that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demands “<em>truth” </em>from these games</a></span>. People who <em>expect </em>answers for their sleuthing and investment. In my humble opinion, those folks are playing these games—and engaging with art—in a reductive manner, and only getting in the way of their own enjoyment.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799"><strong>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree’s Story, Explained</strong></a></span></p><p>The absolute truth of these games is <em>supposed</em> to elide you, you dingbats. Whatever absolute meaning you are trying to wring from them flies in the face of the entire point of FromSoft’s preferred method of storytelling. If Miyazaki wanted players to know everything about the game, he and his team could’ve simply written it out for you in a game rich with endless dialogue, exposition, and scenes pontificating on every minute detail. The fact that these games have never fit that mold should have clued you all into an obvious fact: there is no truth waiting for you at the center of <em>Elden Ring</em> or its expansion.</p><p>Disgruntled players who can’t believe that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>would end in such an abrupt and curt manner are outright hoping that there’s a secret ending to be uncovered. Though <em>Elden Ring </em>didn’t have a secret one, it did feature multiple endings depending on what quests you completed and what force/faction you ultimately aligned with. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>lacks a similar framework, and Miyazaki has outright stated that the DLC wouldn’t impact the endings already baked into the game, but that hasn’t stopped a select few from praying that those claims were little more than a red herring.</p><p>I find how little I understand <em>Elden Ring </em>to be a fucking joy, y’all. When I do come back to it, I love trying to click the puzzle pieces together. Some of them fit, and others don’t. Some of them may <em>never </em>click and that’s okay. I can master the game’s mechanics and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225">dog-walk half of these bosses in my sleep</a></span>, but there’s <em>something </em>about the fact that I may never really understand all of its mysteries, including Miquella’s motivations for abandoning the Lands Between and seeking godhood, or whatever people are bent out of shape about. I’ll never really stop exploring the larger-than-life cast of <em>Elden Ring </em>and that keeps the thrill of it alive. I don’t need to know everything about <em>Elden Ring </em>to know that I love it and love being engaged by it. Believe it or not, that’s enough.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the sequel to 2019's scrappy but enjoyable historical fantasy RPG GreedFall, will launch into Steam early access on 24th September this year.
</p>
<p>
Despite its rough edges, the original GreedFall was a bit of a surprise hit, its blend of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice striking enough of a chord that it went on to sell 2m copies. So it wasn't a huge surprise when developer Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/historical-fantasy-rpg-greedfall-is-getting-a-sequel-in-2024">announced plans for a follow-up in 2022</a>.
</p>
<p>
As we learned at the time, GreedFall 2 begins three years prior to the events of the first game, casting players as a Teer Fradee native, uprooted from their island home and taken to the continent of Gacane. Here, they must use "diplomacy, cunning, or combat", as well as help from their allies, to regain their freedom and "end one man's ambitions of conquest, which could spell the end for the continent and your island."

<p>
"Travel across new landscapes, from Olima... to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands," GreedFall 2's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/Greedfall_II_The_Dying_World/">Steam page</a> continues. "Meet all the factions that share control over these nations and navigate the treacherous waters of their schemes and conspiracies."
</p>
<p>
Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-will-launch-in-early-access">confirmed its plans to launch GreedFall 2: The Dying World into Steam early access</a> back in March, explaining it would be "relying heavily on early access to collect player feedback and see if we're heading in the right direction." In particular, it said it was keen to get the game's combat in front of players because it was "something new".
</p>
<p>
And now the studio has confirmed early access begins on 24th September, when - as it explained previously - players will have access to the "entire beginning of the game". Spiders plans to release updates at "regular intervals" after that (saves won't be compatible between updates, it's warned), all leading to GreedFall 2's 1.0 launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, that final release will maintain some of its predecessor's charm. As Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-review-technical-shortcomings-are-overcome-by-an-abundance-of-heart">review of the first game</a>, "GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults, and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings."

However, they’ve discovered that the update has also created entirely new ways in which you can make your character look quite silly. Naturally, hilarious screenshots have ensued.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196452" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the biggest aspects of the graphics update is the better character models it’s introduced, with faces receiving significant improvements.

The trend has quickly spiraled into players just making all sorts of silly faces, many of which recreate memes from all over the internet. Some great examples include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one poster</a></span> making their Viera look like the meme of Jamie Lee Curtis yelling at someone and then drinking a glass of water, as well as so many female Hrothgar players just making their Warriors of Light do cat memes. Take a look at what the <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> community has come up with thanks to all these new bones.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you've had your eyes on GreedFall II: The Dying World for a while now, you won't have to wait too long. NACON and Spiders officially announced that the roleplaying game will enter Early Access on September 24. This title expands on the universe of GreedFall, which has a strong community of over 2 million players. If you are interested in Early Access to GreedFall II: The Dying World, it enters Early Access on Steam specifically as of September 24.</p>
<p>When this releases, players will get to explore the beginnings of the game, including the first few chapters, which introduce players to the realms of Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis. While players get to explore these brand new areas, there will also be important characters that you get to meet along the way. You will then get to form bonds with some of these characters, and they can accompany you on your adventures as you explore these brand-new realms.</p>
<p>GreedFall II: The Dying World will continue to be updated throughout the early access period, where you will see more content consistently added to the game. This includes brand-new quests, new features and improvements, and exciting zones to explore to give you the most impactful experience as you play the game. If you have yet to hear about the game, check out their<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sol7cwP8mI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new release date trailer </a>to see what you can expect by getting stuck into GreedFall II: The Dying World.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sol7cwP8mI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this game, you are a native of Teer Fradee and were uprooted by force from your island. You were then made to travel to the continent of Gacane, home to the colonists. Compared to home, this continent has an old-world feel, and you have to survive through the constant state of conflict, Malichor Plague, and outrageous political scheming as you try your best to carve out your destiny and break away from Gacane. Through it all, you must try to stop one man from taking over the world. If he succeeds, it could cause the entire world to fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, console owners will have a bit of a longer wait. GreedFall II: The Dying World will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 once the game gets out of early access.</p>
<p>Why not jump back into GreedFall during the wait and check out their DLC to prepare for your upcoming journey from Teer Fradee? Additionally, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/">our preview of GreedFall 2: The Dying World</a> to see if it's a game you are prepared to dive into.</p>

Previously, he had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/nightmarish-wifi-toothbrush-finally-does-some-good-after-tech-wizard-hacks-doom-onto-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/nightmarish-wifi-toothbrush-finally-does-some-good-after-tech-wizard-hacks-doom-onto-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ported <em>Doom </em>to an electronic toothbrush</a></span>. This time, his latest creation is NSFW. The content creator was able to get the original Doom running on a Tifforun sex toy—specifically one marketed as an Automatic Telescopic Masturbator.</p><p>According to Christophel, this was one of the only electronic fleshlights he could find that had a built-in screen. Once he got his hands on the sex toy, the creator cracked it open and stuck some extra hardware inside to help the device run Doom. </p><p>To play <em>Doom </em>on Tifforun’s sex toy you simply use the device’s pre-existing buttons to move the Doomguy forward, backward, and left to right. Another button fires your gun. Simple as that. And when you kill a demon or zombie in this version of <em>Doom </em>the device pumps once, providing anyone with a penis some pleasure. But you only get one stroke per kill. So if you want to finish the fight, so to speak, you’ll need to do a lot of killing. </p><p>Anyway, I’m nervous about the future of <em>Doom </em>ports. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374">Now that most devices have been added to the list</a></span>, I worry about what comes next. There are probably a lot of sex toys out there that can’t run <em>Doom </em>yet. Well, for now...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The video shows off a pool area for attendees to float around in as well as a steep, stomach-churning waterslide, but the team also promises other features, including lazy rivers, wave pools, water coasters, changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Building upon its highly successful predecessor, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> gives players the ability to push the boundaries of creativity like never before,” Frontier explains. “Be inspired by spectacular real-world parks and create vibrant guest plazas with enhanced building and pathing tools. Intuitive piece-by-piece building tools and mesmerising new themes make it simple for players to elevate their park building to the next level.”</p><p>Planet Coaster 2 aims to enhance the experience players remember from the series’ last outing, so while new watery tools will freshen up the theme-park management gameplay, some fan-favorite rides will return, too. Other new tools include animatronics, smoke, water jets, and unique sounds to ensure guests stay happy. </p><p>Frontier also promises three game modes to enjoy: Career mode, Franchise mode, and Sandbox mode. Career sees players completing specific scenarios, while franchise challenges players to build out a worldwide park network. Sandbox, meanwhile, lets thrill-seekers design parks to their heart’s content.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Planet Coaster 2 Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Finally, Frontier says playing with friends will be “easier than ever” in Planet Coaster 2. That’s thanks to the ability to visit friends’ parks and compete in Franchise mode leaderboards. Even Sandbox mode includes the option to jump into shared levels, allowing for cooperative building across platforms.</p><p>Frontier plans to reveal further details in Frontier Unlocked livestreams, which are set to premiere on the last Wednesday of every month. We enjoyed Planet Coaster upon its launch in 2016, giving it an 8.5/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/planet-coaster-review"><u>our review</u></a>. At the time, we said, “Planet Coaster is a wild ride of delightfully customizable roller coaster theme parks and light economics.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
