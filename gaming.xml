              <p>With hundreds of laptops available today, it almost feels like there’s one model for every person out there. But if you’re working with a tighter budget and don’t want to settle for a Chromebook without Windows, there’s a solid option to consider: This HP 14-inch laptop (64GB storage) is packing Windows 11 Home and ranks among the top 5 bestsellers on Amazon—and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">it’s hitting its lowest price for a Windows laptop we’ve seen at $171, down from $229</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Budget Windows Laptop for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>It has a razor-thin and light design along with a <strong>14-inch HD micro-edge bezel display of only 6.5mm</strong> and provides an immersive viewing experience with a 79% screen-to-body ratio. That is, you are nearly entirely viewing screen when you look at it which is ideal if you want a laptop that is up-to-date in terms of appearance without the clunky body. The 1366×768 screen resolution offers sharp images that will play nicely for streaming and the thin bezel renders the machine compact enough to carry around all day long.</p>



<p>Internally, the Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core processor strikes a balance between energy efficiency and power. It’s not meant for heavy users doing intensive tasks like video editing or all-day gaming sessions but it’s good enough for everyday use and does it while monitoring battery life to take you through the day. Intel UHD Graphics 600 offers streaming capabilities for 4K media and light games, so it satisfies light media needs with ease. The laptop’s 4GB of RAM enhances multitasking abilities and speeds up app switching, making it less frustrating during those hectic moments.</p>
<p>Storage is acceptable considering the price with a 64GB embedded multimedia flash card providing quick access to your files and software, though you might want additional external or cloud storage if you’re creating high-definition video or large sets of photography. Windows 11 Home edition comes pre-installed, which gives you the updated features and interface improvements, which make the device run quicker and easier to navigate than older releases of Windows or limited systems like Chromebooks.</p>
<p>If your laptop needs aren’t fancy but you want something that runs Windows just fine, this one’s worth a look.</p>

What's that floating like a flotsam-y life raft on the surface? Why, it's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/mailbox">Nintendo Life Mailbox</a>. Grab on!</p>
<p>Yes, it's time for our monthly letters page feature. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Not a huge selection this month - presumably you've all been busy playing the video games. So, let's dry these few missives in the sun and get reading, shall we?</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - September 2025</h2>
<h3>"frightfully confusing" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo variable pricing for Switch 1 and 2 games is becoming a frightfully confusing situation. Let's run down some costs here first of all for physical games:</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 (switch 2 version): £58.99 RRP<br>
Metroid Prime 4 (switch 1 version): £49.99 RRP<br>
Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Switch 2): £66.99 RRP<br>
Mario Galaxy 1+2 (Switch 1): £58.99 RRP</p>
<p>So... How on earth is the SWITCH 2 version of Metroid Prime 4, a game that took 8 years of development and is clearly one of Nintendo's most expensive projects, the same price as ports of two old Wii Mario games for Switch 1?</p>
<p>I have actually managed via a third party seller to acquire a Metroid Prime 4, Switch 2 version pre-order for £48.85. That is insane value, and yet Nintendo are charging through the roof for what can only be objectively described as a less significant gaming experience.</p>
<p>When Bill Trinnen said variable pricing was based on the overall experience and value proposition, I'm sorry but, absolute porkies Bill. This situation belies any logic and I cannot get my head around it. Please understand? How Bill, How!?<br>
<strong><em>YoshiTails</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting aside the fact that nobody knows yet if Prime 4 is "insane value" at that price, Nintendo charges what they think people will pay, end of. Bill's being a bit vague, but he's not telling porkies. Nintendo looks at the Galaxy bundle and sees not a pair of polished-up ports pushed out on an ageing console, but two 10/10 all-timers (and they've got the review scores to prove it) brought together in a convenient package. An "objectively...less significant gaming experience" it is not.</p>
<p>The price tag stings for you and me — people who paid and played these games years ago — but millions of people <em>will</em> pay £58.99 and be over the moon with them. And the rest of us? Maybe we’ll pick up Galaxy 2 down the road.</p>
<p>As for Metroid, the series is growing, but it's not in Mario's league sales-wise. If they want to sell decent numbers (to people beyond Metroid devotees who would pay $90 if they <em>had</em> to), 60 quid is a reasonable ask - the value-proposition sweet spot for that game, by Nintendo's judgement.</p>
<p>And Nintendo would never (publicly) use dev and the associated costs to justify higher price points because it would bite them in the ass when ‘Mario Party Boogaloo’ arrives in 12 months' time and everyone starts complaining it isn't $40. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"I want to vet"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the big problems with Shovelware is it makes new game discovery almost impossible. Back in the DSi games, I would occasionally download random games that just sounded kind of fun and discovered a lot of real gems this way. Today, I find myself scrolling through the weekly Nintendo Download section you fine people provide and I sometimes see a title that looks like it might be fun, but I'm afraid to get burned by some false-advertising shovelware game. This means that there are probably some real indie gems out there that are getting overlooked.</p>
<p>My question: Since Nintendo doesn't seem to be in a rush to fix this issue, what steps should I take when I want to vet a new, fun-sounding game to see if it's legit? What are the tells that you're going to get a piece of shovelware garbage?<br>
<strong>Pak-Man</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We covered how to avoid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">'keyword bingo' and 'scam' games</a> a while ago, so check out that article if you missed it. Generally, though, those are fairly easy to spot - and that goes for the AI-slop and rubbish that outfits like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aaldora">Aldora</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Apakotime">Pakotime</a> pump out weekly.</p>
<p>I get the sense you mean games which might look like a Downwell or a VVVVVV or a [insert brilliant pixel-art game here] from the outside but turn out to be low-effort rubbish? Most games that look like Vampire Survivors are <em>not</em> Vampire Survivors! I understand the predicament.</p>
<p>It's still quite rare, though, to find a good game with literally zero positivity <em>somewhere</em> on the internet. If you've run out of bona fide classics in your backlog and want to get adventurous or catch up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/reader-recommendations">gems you missed</a>, I'd make sure to find a clip of the game running at least. Seeing it in motion will filter out plenty.</p>
<p>And the rest? That uncertainty is part of the thrill, I suppose! I don't remember the last time I bought a game on a whim without knowing exactly what it was. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"nerf yourself"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,</p>
<p>A big part of the Donkey Kong series is the amazing boss battles, so I was disappointed with the lack of difficulty in Donkey Kong Bananza. I know that a counterargument is that if you want more difficulty, you should use less hearts and recovery items, but I don’t find it fun to “nerf” yourself. That’s like saying “If you think Super Mario Bros. is too easy, you should play it blindfolded.” In his YouTube channel, Sakurai discussed the importance of “risk and reward,” so not only should games have options for difficulty, but games should encourage players to go for the highest difficulty that they can handle. I feel that a good example of this in a platformer is Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair—not only did that game have customizable difficulty, but it had an in-game reward system that encouraged you to go for higher difficulty. I just find it sad that more and more games are giving out rewards with no risk. Back in my day, games weren’t afraid to challenge you. And, by gum, we liked it!<br>
Oh dear. I’ve become Cranky Kong.<br>
<strong>-Anonymous</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know, I hit a wall with the final boss and still haven't been back because I got distracted by banandium when I went back to the higher levels.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty discourse around Silksong wound me up (though not quite as much as 'Silksong's too cheap!'), although I get it — who's got the time we had back in the day to spend a whole summer beating one incredibly difficult game? I also get not wanting to self-nerf.</p>
<p>More intelligently implemented options around difficulty are a good thing in my book. Nintendo often errs on the cautious side with its trad-style, three-hit-kill Mario and Zelda bosses, but I don't come to those games looking for friction or mountain to summit. <em>Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"the same guy"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello hello! It's the same guy who went on a tirade last month about Blaster Master Zero being underrated! (I hope I got a few new believers).</p>
<p>I did end up giving Just Shaped and Beats a whirl per your recommendations and you know what? I'm a fan. What you see is what you get, it's no nonsense, the beats are beautiful, it's addicting, and there are two connections to Mega Man. Sort of.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A track by Bossfight features in the game. Bossfight also did a stellar remix of Wily Stage 1 from Mega Man 2 (even a live performance!). And the track Yokuman Stage? Lifted straight from the fangame Mega Man Unlimited.</p>
<p>That's enough rambling from me though, have a great day/night.</p>
<p>P.S. Silksong coming out is challenging Shinobi: Art of Vengeance as my Game of the Year and it hurts the Sega child in me.<br>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above).

When Sony’s PlayStation and PlayStation 2 dominated the Sega, Nintendo, and Microsoft competition, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">selling over a hundred million boxes</a> into our living rooms — <em>each! — </em>they created a profitable virtuous cycle. More consoles meant selling more games, which meant attracting more developers to make <em>even more</em> games, which meant big dollar signs for Sony.</p><div><p>The box will continue to be the tip of the spear, but it’s no longer the point. </p></div><p>But to get those dollar signs spinning and keep them spinning, console makers <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">greased the wheels</a><em>.</em> The console wars were initially fought with exclusive games, tempting you to buy the only system that could play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, or <em>Super Mario 64</em>, or <em>Halo</em>.</p><p>Later, the “wars” enlisted your friends, too. Microsoft turned the tables in 2005 with the Xbox 360, which made both local and online multiplayer easier than on PlayStation, just in time for the explosion of online gaming and four-player couch titles. Were you really going to buy the “wrong” console and miss out on games with your pals? What if they insisted on PlayStation? The world’s internet forums erupted in debate about the merits of each brand and technical capabilities of each console.</p><p>But a funny thing happened after Sony introduced the PlayStation 3, the most powerful hardware yet. Angry devs made it known that Sony’s exotic Cell architecture was exceedingly and annoyingly difficult for game development. Valve cofounder Gabe Newell famously called it “<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps3-a-waste-of-time-says-valves-newell">a waste of everybody’s time</a>.”</p><p>No game console manufacturer wanted to risk repeating the mistake. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3180484/amd-bob-feldstein-xbox-720-ps4-wii-u-hired-nvidia">By 2012</a>, Sony and Microsoft had chosen AMD x86 chips for their next hardware, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4452488/amd-sparks-x86-transition-for-next-gen-game-consoles">giving them the same architecture as Windows PCs</a>, and they’ve never looked back. Combined with the rise of premade multiplatform game engines like Unreal and Unity, it became easier for developers to bring their games to more platforms simultaneously.</p><div><p id="how-its-going"><h2>How it’s going</h2></p></div><p>The console wars are long over. Sure, Nintendo is still Nintendo and you’ll need a Switch to play flagship <em>Mario</em> or <em>Pokémon</em>, but the majority of games arrive and let you play with friends on your console of choice, so long as you can afford a console at all. The price of existing Xboxes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">and PlayStations</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Switches are</a> all rising now that they don’t truly compete anymore: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">an Xbox Series X will soon cost $150 more</a> than it did last year.</p><div><p>But on the software sharing front, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements">even Sony, which held back cross-platform multiplayer (aka crossplay) for years</a> as its PS4 outsold the Xbox One, is seriously coming around.</p></div><div><p>This month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697430/helldivers-2-xbox-playstation-published-release-date">Sony published its first PlayStation game on Xbox</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and it became <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox">the best-selling game on Microsoft’s platform</a>. And <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636178/microsoft-playstation-store-ps5-xbox-games-preorder-chart">Xbox games topped the Sony PlayStation preorder charts</a> in March! Has hell frozen over? No — Sony and Microsoft realized it’d be more lucrative to sell games as many places as they can, instead of making you buy a specific box.</p></div><p>Don’t take my word for it: “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” Sony SVP Sadahiko Hayakawa <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">told investors this August</a>. It’s the most concrete statement of a changing industry yet — last May, the company was still suggesting it’d <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">use big single-player titles to push you to buy a PlayStation</a>.</p><p>But even when games are still “exclusive,” they’re often just “timed console exclusives” these days. While this is less true of Sony, many games appear on PC the same day they come to PlayStation or Xbox, and additionally come to rivals months later. Even <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, once a killer app for the original Sony PlayStation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777468/clouds-everywhere">is finally fair game</a>: its remake will arrive on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2 on January 22nd, 2026, years after the PS4 and PS5 releases.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft’s timed console exclusive <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"> </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">took just four months to hit PS5</a>, and it launched its <em>Gears of War</em> remaster on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC the very same day in August, bringing one of its most iconic games to its rival. Heck, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761329/helldivers-2s-halo-crossover-explained">there’s even a <em>Halo</em> crossover</a> in the PlayStation-published <em>Helldivers 2</em>, one you can play on PS5.</p><p>For Microsoft, these are arguably moves of necessity. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24074729/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-everywhere-memo">Microsoft’s “every screen is an Xbox” strategy</a> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">seemingly rooted</a> in the fact that physical Xboxes just aren’t selling as well as the company planned, and as a result neither is Xbox Game Pass, the company’s subscription service that bundles downloadable games and streaming games you can play across Xbox, PC, and even your phone. But just as Sony <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/former-sony-exec-finally-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud-putting-playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money/">realized it could print money</a> by bringing its PlayStation games to PC now that it’s so easy, so too does Microsoft believe it can shore up Xbox sales by putting those games on PlayStation.</p><p>If you take this idea to its logical conclusion and make the box unnecessary, what do these brands actually represent? What does Xbox <em>mean</em> without the box? What does PlayStation mean without the station?</p><div><p id="what-happens-next"><h2>What happens next</h2></p></div><p>We don’t <em>fully</em> need to answer that question, because the box won’t go away. Most people don’t want to think about <em>how</em> they’re going to play a game; they just want to buy the latest thing at the store, plug it in, and play. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on">As impressive as cloud gaming services have become</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon">still far too much friction</a> for them to replace consoles the way Netflix and friends have replaced DVDs. And there’s far too much money on the table for Sony, or even Microsoft, to risk leaving all the store shelves to their competition.</p><div><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">already confirmed it’s building a next-gen Xbox</a>, teasing “the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation,” and the rumor mill already has <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107684/playstation-6-full-specs-leak-rtx-5090-level-ray-tracing-6-12x-faster-rt-gaming-than-ps5/index.html">supposed PS6 specifications</a>.</p></div><p>But for the past 12 years, most people haven’t realized an Xbox and a PlayStation have fundamentally become the same thing — a budget AMD gaming PC that punches far above its weight, with a speedy interface optimized for living room gaming. And their makers can reach tens, even hundreds of millions more players if they embrace it and sell games to the entire PC ecosystem, including one another.</p><p>The interfaces and games are what put the X in Xbox and the Play in PlayStation, not what’s under the box’s hood. So it may be time for Sony and Microsoft to complete the transformation from console to PC and reap the rewards.</p><p>One of the beautiful things about PC gaming is that it <em>scales</em>. I can play the same game on my Steam Deck that I play on my beefy gaming desktop, as long as I’m willing to settle for weaker graphics on the go. Or I can play a 15-year-old PC game on either of them.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft have each dipped toes in these waters: you can play certain PS4 games on a PS4 Pro, or a PS5, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">or a PS5 Pro</a>, each with different levels of performance and graphical fidelity, so long as developers have provided a patch for the game. The same is true of Xbox: with the Xbox One, Xbox One X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X, the more powerful consoles can sometimes play older games better.</p><p>But simply launching a new console, followed a few years later with a more powerful version of that same console with limited improvements for older games, doesn’t come close to the way that PC games can automatically perform better and better on each new generation of hardware and even scale down to a handheld. And it doesn’t preserve decades of pre-x86 games for play.</p><p>That’s why it’s looking like the next Xbox might literally be a series of PCs, running Windows and playing Windows games, built by Microsoft’s partners. By making PC games the future of Xbox, including old Xbox titles preserved for PC, Microsoft could focus on being a game publisher, operating system vendor, and cloud provider instead of building loss-leading hardware too. (Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial">admitted in 2021</a> it sells the hardware at a loss, and Sony sometimes has too.)</p><p>There’s evidence Microsoft might go this way. In one month, the company will co-launch the Xbox Ally X with Asus, a PC handheld with an Xbox interface that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">can even show Steam games</a> alongside Microsoft’s own. Court documents show <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878376/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-pc-games-streaming-ftc-documents">Microsoft was planning to stream Windows games</a>, not just Xbox games, over its xCloud cloud gaming service as well. It’s hinted about efforts to build an Xbox game preservation team, perhaps to give its console games a new PC future.</p><p>And if the goal is to sell games rather than consoles, why would Microsoft’s studios create Xbox “console” games to start? I’d expect they’re working on gamepad-enabled PC games that can run on both next-gen “Xbox” PCs and normal PCs, with no porting at all.</p><p>It’s not currently as clear what’s happening in the Sony camp, but I’d be surprised if PlayStation wasn’t headed the same way. In 2022, the company revealed it wanted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">half its games releases to be on PC or mobile by 2025</a>, drastically reducing the share on console, and it’s sold loads of games on PC as a result. It also just released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779837/sony-playstation-5-ps5-update-power-saving-mode">a Power Saver mode</a> that sounds designed to make PlayStation games scale down like PC games do.</p><p>While the PS5 Pro can play some PS4 games better, it doesn’t always work the other way around: brand-new games designed for the latest console generally won’t run on weaker hardware. But rumor is, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">a future PlayStation handheld</a> will play PS5 games on the go, and the Power Saver mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">might be the perfect way to help it out</a>.</p><p>It’s possible that Sony and Microsoft might stop short of truly turning the console into a PC. They might not be ready to give up the crown jewels of their gaming portfolios just yet. They might just pay it lip service for one more round of consoles: remember when Sony <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-loses-eu-customs-case-as-ps2-is-branded-a-console">called the PS2 a computer</a>, and when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4352654/xbox-one-powered-by-windows-app-development">Microsoft technically ran Windows</a> under the Xbox One’s hood?</p><p>But neither company necessarily sees its future in a box. They see their future in games themselves, games that could sell many more places than they currently do.</p><p>The box will continue to be the tip of the spear, but it’s no longer the point.</p><div><p id="by-the-way"><h2>By the way</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>You’ll notice I barely talk about Nintendo. That’s partly because it’s the only company that can afford to keep pursuing the old model of “you’ve gotta buy our system to play our games,” because its games are so good, and because it makes money on every console sold too.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-is-offloading-the-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-for-early-prime-day-now-selling-at-a-steal-2000627467</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-is-offloading-the-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-for-early-prime-day-now-selling-at-a-steal.1303722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter and Star Wars have always been LEGO’s biggest hits, and that’s no accident. These sets click with fans in a way few things do: they’re beautifully designed, instantly recognizable and tap into stories that people love to revisit.</p>
<p>Out of all of them, the <strong>Hogwarts castle and grounds</strong> set is one that really captures the magic. It’s <strong>sitting at a 4.8 out of 5 rating with nearly 2,000 reviews</strong>, which should tell you just how much people enjoy it. And the timing couldn’t be better: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">right now on Amazon it’s down to $136 from $169, the lowest price it’s ever been</a>. With early Prime Day deals already dropping, this one could vanish quickly if stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Creating The Magic of Hogwarts at Home</h2>
<p>There’s something special about seeing Hogwarts assemble before your own eyes, piece by piece. It’s not just the castle – it’s the grounds and the castle, in LEGO detail for the very first time ever. <strong>With 2,660 pieces</strong>, you’ve got a project that’s in-depth without being overwhelming. When finished, it’s <strong>more than 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong>, a near-perfect balance between stand-out large and fit-as-a-book small.</p>
<p>And the details, those details – those create the magic. The Great Hall, the Astronomy Tower, the greenhouses, bridges, courtyards, the Boathouse on the Black Lake—it’s all there. Hidden spots bring more surprises: the Chamber of Secrets, the Potions Classroom, the Winged Key room, and the giant chessboard chamber. Out on the lake you’ll notice the Beauxbatons Carriage and the Durmstrang Ship, while the Whomping Willow (complete with a flying Ford Anglia) adds another nod to the films.</p>



<p>And then of course, is the actual enjoyment, which is building. Sets like these are built with adult fans in mind and give you a project that you can get your hands on, recharging while creating. It’s the kind of build that feels almost meditative: you settle in, sort the bricks, and step by step construct one of the most iconic landmarks from the Wizarding World. And when you’re done, it isn’t just a pile of bricks, it’s a model that looks fantastic on display and instantly sparks conversations.</p>
<p>What makes this deal even sweeter is the price point. At $136, you’re getting a set this detailed for less than many similar adult-oriented LEGO models which often climb past $200. With the number of pieces, the design quality, and Harry Potter set popularity in mind, this is one of those offers that does not sit around.</p>

<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5400365af705/yoshi-touch-and-go-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>We're back with another clash of the covers as we embark on this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-operation-c-probotector-game-boy">Last time</a>, it was the Game Boy's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a> (or <strong>Probotector</strong>, depending on your region) being put in the limelight, and we had a full three covers to choose between. It was the North American design that walked away with the win, however, snatching up 56% of the vote and splitting the remaining 23% and 21% between Japan and Europe, respectively.</p>
<p>With another Yoshi game on the horizon (don't tell us you had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">The Mysterious Book</a> already!), we thought it only right to head back to Mario's dino pal this week, as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a> on the DS. It's not the greatest Yoshi game by any means, but we remember having some fun with it back in the mid-2000s.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fwskvyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one, so we've got a good old-fashioned duel on our hands. Crack out of your shell and let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:144307 @ 1758456082 -->
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b3b55b296f33/yoshi-touch-and-go-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bright, colourful and just a little bit sweet, we've got a soft spot for the European design. Yoshi and Baby Mario take centre stage as a Shy Guy propels by in the top corner, and the small stylus icon tells you everything you need to know about the game's controls. Neat!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34a49b5f518ff/yoshi-touch-and-go-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design goes for something very different indeed. It's far more stripped back than its counterparts, and puts the focus on a little bit of peril. Baby Mario is a bigger focal point of this one (you can't knock a bit of brand recognition), and we see the stylus iconography make a return in the crayon line background.</p>

<p>As part of the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">40th anniversary news</a>, Nintendo revealed it would be offering a "limited-time" Nintendo Museum ticket.</p>
<p>Instead of the regular Mii design, for the next year (between now and September 2026), Nintendo Museum guests will be able to get a special Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary design. Again, this will be available for "approximately one year". Here it is:</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce860db020de8/nintendo-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's official Museum webpage explains how all tickets will be this Mario anniversary design by default during this period. If you've already set your ticket to the Mii design, there's no need to worry, as you can swap it via the official Nintendo Museum ticketing website before visiting.</p>
<p>Nintendo's website also mentions how the specific "end date for the special Mario design will be announced at a later date".</p>
<p>Nintendo is expanding on these celebrations at its museum as well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-museum-introduces-limited-time-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-ticket">with not only its art gallery</a> (featuring art from Mario's games), but also a "limited-time" lighting display, which will begin in December 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Museum will be illuminated with special lighting throughout the facility from Wednesday, December 3, 2025, to Monday, April 27, 2026. During this period, the special lighting will be active from 4:00 PM until closing. At the Warp Pipe photo spot, a special installation featuring the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary logo will be on display. Visitors can take photos with it throughout the day.</p>
<p>*The lighting display is accessible only to those with a valid ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from these updates for the Nintendo Museum, Nintendo shared many other Mario anniversary announcements during its recent Direct. You can catch up on all of this in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life. This includes new games, returning titles, and even the next Mario Movie.</p>

<p>Watch out, SEGA</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team Reptile has announced it will be releasing another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/jet_grind_radio">Jet Set</a>-style release. Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_rush_cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> on the Switch in 2023, it has now unveiled its new project <strong>Hyperfunk</strong>.</p>
<p>The exact name and details are "subject to change". It's targeting a PC and console launch, but specific platforms and the release date haven't been confirmed just yet. Here's the official summary, and above you can check out the teaser trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team Reptile’s new game is called HYPERFUNK. An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/">Steam listing</a> also notes how you'll be able to "meet random online players" and "hang out online with your friends".</p>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66feeabf95fbe/jet-set-radio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Reptile</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In case you missed it, there's also an option in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that allows you to unlock the framerate. Team Reptile originally shared this detail alongside the Switch 2 launch. Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Playing Bomb Rush Cyberfunk on Switch 2? Know that there is an option in the game to unlock the framerate up to 60fps named 'Unleash the beast'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Team Reptile is the same team behind the projectile fighter series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lethal_league_blaze">Lethal League</a>. This reveal follows on from Sega announcing it would be reviving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/jet_grind_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/sega-reveals-new-details-for-shinobi-jet-set-radio-streets-of-rage-revivals">alongside multiple other classic IPs</a>.</p>

<p>The recent Direct broadcast revealed the Virtual Boy library would be joining the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library.</p>
<p>As you've likely already seen, there are a few paywalls. Firstly, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack subscription (on top of the regular Switch Online subscription), and according to Nintendo, a paid accessory is "required".</p>
<p>There are two options here - the Virtual Boy replica for <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> or the more affordable cardboard model for <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187794 @ 1758457007 -->
<p>With all of this in mind, it's got us wondering if you're planning to check out this new digital collection when it arrives for Switch and Switch 2 on 17th February 2026. <em>So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

		<p>Warner Bros. Games has released an eight minute long video which delves into how Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has come to be, including the inspirations. There is also more footage from the game which shows the different eras players will go through, including young Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman, including his training with the League of Shadows.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Behind the Scenes - Building the Legacy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iB9SqHGitFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The video shows how every era of Batman has been used to create Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, including the movies, TV shows, and the comic archive. The developers also give a look at how iconic moments from across Batman’s history have been used to create the story and build the city of Gotham, with lots of familiar locations. The city will have a lot going on for players to discover including areas where crimes are happening that need to be thwarted. Batman is not the sole focus of the game, with the Bat Family and rogues gallery playing an incredibly important part in proceedings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 are doing a lot to fight cheating on PC, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requirement of Secure Boot</a> and Trusted Platform Module (TDM) 2.0. However, nowadays, cheating is an issue even on consoles. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Push Square</a>, Ripple Effect Technical Director Christian Buhl said they have partnered with Sony and Microsoft to better detect things like Cronus Zen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</em></p>



<p><em>So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here.</em> <em>And we want to preserve as much of the fair play and competitive integrity that we can, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure that you're having a fair competitive space to play Battlefield 6 in.</em></p>



<p>Cronus Zen not only fools games into believing a player is using the gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard they've actually connected to their consoles, but it also provides access to game scripts and a script compiler, opening the door to many different types of cheats. Needless to say, this could ruin the experience of many players once Battlefield 6 launches on October 10. Here's hoping the collaboration with Sony and Microsoft turns out to be helpful against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ripple Effect also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that console players will be able to turn off cross-play with PC, which remains the platform most likely to be affected by cheats.</p>

<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39bc17e5e3c50/resident-evil-requiem-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since the first big blowout Direct for the Switch 2 back in April, I’ve been itching to see an announcement for <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the new console. It’s possibly my favourite series of all time, after all, so I’m eager to play the recent entries on a Nintendo console without having to connect to the bloomin’ Cloud. Heck, aren’t we all?</p>
<p>I’ve been banging on about it so much over online chats and meetings that I’m quite sure my colleagues were just about sick of it weeks ago. So you can imagine how much my excitement ramped up when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">rumours began to surface</a> about not only existing RE Engine games making their way to Switch 2, but also the upcoming ninth mainline entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Surely not, right? We’re Nintendo fans, for goodness’ sake; we’re used to getting ports of games months, if not years after their release on other platforms. That’s if they even get ported <em>at all</em>, of course. Which often isn’t the case. And that’s fine, y’know, we’ve got our own first-party games to enjoy, plus a plethora of incredible indie titles.</p>

<p>But then it happened. Towards at the end of the latest Nintendo Direct, atmospheric shots of spooky hallways emerged, followed by the ringing of a telephone. 'Is this Resident Evil?!' I asked myself. And, stone the crows, it <em>was</em>! Not just any Resident Evil either, but as rumoured, it was Resident Evil Requiem, launching day-and-date with other consoles on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, represents a pretty significant shift for the Switch 2 early in its lifespan. As I said, we’re so used to getting ports of games long after their initial release on other platforms (or, in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, just a few weeks later), but this is a major new entry in one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time – a franchise in which 4 of the 13 titles available on Switch were relegated to Cloud Versions. Yet there it was; a native port launching right alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>There was once a time – very briefly, mind you – in which Capcom and Nintendo were besties, with the former bringing a bunch of exclusives to the GameCube, including the now-iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Thanks to lukewarm sales, it didn't last long, and with Nintendo subsequently going in a drastically different direction to Sony and Microsoft, flagship RE games just weren't a thing on Nintendo consoles anymore.</p>
<p>The success of the Switch did change things quite a bit, and Capcom has done an admirable job in supporting the system over the years, but from the customer's point of view, and from <em>our</em> point of view, Cloud Versions just aren't good enough, and it felt like Switch owners were still drawing the short straw. Now, we're back in the driver's seat, and it feels wonderful.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting some major revolution in which every publisher suddenly rushes to launch their flagship games on the Switch 2, but the console’s remarkable success since its launch just a handful of months back has clearly made executives sit up and pay attention. This, along with the Switch 2's favourably comparable specs to the Series S has made immediate ports of new games a much more likely prospect.</p>

<p>Now, you could make the argument that Resident Evil Requiem isn’t the first ‘AAA’ game to launch day-and-date with other platforms. We had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> back in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> is launching just next week. But let’s be fair, publishers would still be releasing sports games on the PS2 if they thought they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Seeing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> gave me a great deal of hope that the Switch 2 would be a good home for modern blockbusters, even if it means waiting just that little bit longer. Then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> happened, and that felt like a good nudge in the right direction.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, though? Yeah, that’s on a whole new level. This is a big deal, and I sincerely hope it signifies a bit more openness from publishers to launch their games on the Switch 2 alongside other platforms.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that we're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> in March 2026 alongside other platforms, and there's a good chance <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">the untitled third entry in the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">trilogy</a></strong> will also land day-and-date. Good things are happening folks!</p>
<p>Whether it continues is likely down to how well these games actually sell, so... Yeah, buy Resident Evil Requiem, everyone.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up has dropped a mysterious image onto social media, leading some fans to speculate it could be teasing a horror event or even crossover promotion with the upcoming release of Konami's horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>While there's no cheeky copyright notices or any obvious indication that Stellar Blade is taking us to Silent Hill, Shift Up did share an image of a very Silent Hill Otherworld-esque world onto Stellar Blade's X/Twitter page, complete with crumbling walls, a dilapidated ceiling, and a very familiar rust-red hue. Hmm.</p>

<p>The text – which reads "in one week…" alongside a stars emoji and the hashtag Stellar Blade – similarly doesn't give much away, but coincidentally enough, Silent Hill f – the first mainline Silent Hill game since 2012 – is due to launch next week on 25th September.</p>

<p>As both franchises have partnered with other games for promotional purposes, it's certainly possible, but it could, of course, just be a spooky-themed time-limited event or another horror game or movie with Halloween just a few short weeks away. Whatever it is, hopefully we'll find out soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">Shift Up announced it intends to expand the Stellar Blade franchise with "various derivative works"</a>. A new financial report explored the success of its different products, including Stellar Blade, highlighting the game's impressive performance both at launch and with its port to PC.</p>
<p>The report added (via machine translation): "Through this, [Stellar Blade] was able to effectively secure a new user base and further strengthen its position as a global AAA franchise IP. We plan to develop various derivative works to expand the [Stellar Blade] IP so that [Stellar Blade] can establish itself as a well-made IP."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game.1303377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker Tom Henderson shared an interesting tidbit regarding Kratos and the next God of War game in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHG7oPngE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming's weekly podcast</a>. </p>



<p>Henderson was discussing with the others the likelihood that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off</a> would be announced at the next State of Play (rumored to take place before the end of September). The leaker then remarked that Sony Santa Monica is also working on a new mainline entry, adding that Kratos would be equipped with a brand new weapon from ancient Egypt.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>There's some weird confusion because there is the Metroidvania game in development and then there's also a new mainline God of War game in development, which is kind of similar in themes. I think that Kratos this time has an Egyptian sword, you know, like the curved Egyptian sword. I can't remember what they are called, but I think like what Prince of Persia's got or whatever.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Henderson appears to be referring to the Khopesh, a sickle-shaped sword that evolved in Egypt from battle axes. It would be a new weapon for Kratos, but more to the point, it would indirectly imply a potential Egyptian setting. After all, why would there be an Egyptian sword if that wasn't the case? The Norse duology added fitting weapons like the Leviathan Axe, a weapon historically favored by nordic warriors.</p>



<p>It's not first time that the Egyptian setting has been attached to God of War. Before the release of the 2018 installment, Game Director Cory Barlog said that, after the Norse saga, future games could feature either Egyptian or Mayan mythology.</p>



<p>It's already been three years since the release of Ragnarök. However, if the rumor about the smaller Metroidvania game is correct, chances are the next big main installment is a bit further away. Still, in the meantime, fans have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Amazon Prime Video adaptation</a> to look forward to. The first season is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Would you like for Sony Santa Monica to choose Egypt as the next God of War setting?</p>
