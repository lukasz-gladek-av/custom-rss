<p>Before this one can blast onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong>, Nintendo has served up the game's pre-order goodies on <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fkirby-air-riders" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store UK</a>. As standard, the listings include a small bonus for <em>all</em> pre-orders and the option to upgrade to a 'bundle' for more merch.</p>
<p>We'll start with the standard option. All My Nintendo Store Air Riders pre-orders (<strong>£58.99</strong> for digital, <strong>£66.99</strong> for physical) will come the <em>exclusive</em> Kirby Air Riders Reusable Cup. That's right, <em>it's a cup</em>. It's adorned with pictures of Kirby, Dedede, Chef Kawasaki et al, and it can hold a whopping 350ml of your hot beverage of choice.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Is it the most mind-blowing addition out there? Absolutely not, but we suppose it's roughly on par with the usual keychains and microfibre cloths included in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bundles are a good bit cuter. Upping the price to <strong>£70.99</strong> for a digital copy and <strong>£78.99</strong> for physical, these also throw in a Kirby plushie to sweeten the deal. There are three different plushies to choose between — Warp Star Kirby, Sleepy Kirby and Ultra Sword Kirby — and all are available for the same bundle price on the MNS website.</p>

<p>Both the bonus cup and plushie bundles can now be pre-ordered from the My Nintendo Store UK website, though the extras will only be sticking around "while stocks last", so make sure to get in there quickly if you have a particular purchase in mind.</p>

            <p>Activision have just shown off a bunch of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>-related stuff as part of a COD Next showcase, and naturally one of the biggest talking points is a simp shooting people through walls. Well, to be more accurate, a clip of a pro player called Simp using the new Gravemaker killstreak reward, which resembles the sorts of wallhacking cheats the publishers have been trying their best to give the secure boot.</p>

</p></div>
<p>As you can see in the couple of clips I've scattergunned into the walls of this article, Gravemaker grants those who earn it the ability to see the thermal stick figures of other players through whatever layers of brick or concrete might be in the way, before gently popping these targets out of existence with a sniper rifle. I assume you can add a 360 spin into the process too, if you fancy going full 'mother, retrieve the photographic device'. </p>
<p>Gravemaker's immediately proven as controversial as you might expect, with professional codders wondering whether they'll decide on a gentleperson's agreement not to use it in their high-stakes matches. It's also sticking in the craw of some non-pro players, who've recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">ordered by Activision to make sure secure boot's enabled on their PC</a> if they want to be able to play Blops 7. The reason the publishers have given for that requirement is an effort to get rid of cheating, which can see offenders gain an unfair advantage by enabling the likes of aimbots or, er, the ability to see and shoot foes through walls.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, Gravemaker isn't a permanent effect someone will have enabled every moment of a match, even if the best of the best may be able to queue a number of short nine shot-long bursts of it up to deploy in quick succession. Since it's part of the game, there's also the opportunity for the perks like cold-blooded or gear to offer built-in countermeasures that'll render you not so much of a sitting duck.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>There's also the matter of it not being realistic, but given the unlikeliness of tactical nuclear bombs being regularly lobbed at tiny squares in which two little teams are having a timed scrap, that horse arguably bolted from the killstreak stable a while ago.</p>
<p>I think my main issue is that if you're going to offer wonderfully ludicrous killstreaks, you should go all-in and own it. One of the other things shown off during COD Next was a special pickup truck in Blops 7's Zombies mode. It's dubbed Ol’ Tessie, and serves as a shuffling corpse-proof method of transport "through the malevolent fog coating the Dark Aether".</p>
<p>I know you're now deeply ashamed of being known as the Beavis and Butthead shooter, Call of Duty, but stick those two annoying goofs in a similar pickup and have them rage around the map as a killstreak, with anyone who wanders into auditory range of their sniggers starting to lose health. Have Stan from American Dad transform into a dragon and hand the enemy team bows and Dragonshouts so they're forced to go full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> for a minute. Have a horde of Squid Game characters roam around with instakill baseball bats, and if they get five kills during one streak, the rest of the match features the audio backdrop of a helium-huffing Morgan Freeman reading the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau backwards.</p>
<p>Embrace your calling as not-quite-Fortnite. That's all I, someone who has a comically little amount of skin in the game, ask. Anyway, here's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/30/call-of-duty-next-2025-recap/">a full recap</a> of Cod Next's other major announcements. Blops 7's open beta kicks off this weekend, with pre-orderers and certain Game Pass subscribers able to hop in from October 2nd, while everyone else has to wait until October 5th.</p>

Stats shared by the gaming software giant on Wednesday show the drop-off rate for Epic Games Store installations on iOS has gone from 65 percent down to around 25 percent following the release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alt-distribution-ux-in-the-eu/">iOS 18.6</a> in July.</p><p>The “updated user experience” for installing alternative app marketplaces was introduced in iOS 18.6 following the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636196/apple-eu-dma-probe-alternative-app-stores-tax">EU commission raising concerns in April</a> that “Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative app distribution channels.”</p><p>“They’ve reduced the install flow from 15 steps to 6, eliminating their former scare screen and its misleading message, and eliminated a dead-end that left the user stranded in iOS Settings,” said Epic. “For the first time, we are starting to see iOS users install the Epic Games Store with a success rate approaching Windows users and Apple’s own Mac users.”</p><p>Epic says there are still improvements to be made, however, alleging that Apple’s anticompetitive behavior towards third-party app stores continues to violate the DMA, and is pushing developers to distribute fewer games through the Epic Games Store on iOS compared to Android.

            <p>A stealth patch to Prototype has stoked the fires of hope surrounding a remaster of the beloved third-person gory super hero action game, thanks to some mysterious additions to the games' credits. It also broke a bunch of mods in the process, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The patch, which was introduced on the 29th September, came without prior warning nor any fanfare, with the game receiving no Steam news post to coincide with the update. Instead, Prototype's loyal community had to dig in and figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>These players discovered a real surprise when they hit the game's credits, as several new companies' now appear. This includes staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned developer that previously worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, as well as the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. There's also a mention of a Ubisoft Connect Version, which does not exist.</p>

<p>Further digging was done by some of the game's better known modders and dataminers, who delved into the game post-update for further discoveries. User Nixson discovered locomotion and parkour tests previously absent from the game, which indicate some degree of fresh testing being done in-game. These findings were then<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/"> posted on the Prototype Reddit</a>, where remaining fans gathered in excitement.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/">Rumours surrounding a Prototype remaster have been circulating since earlier this year</a>, though further breadcrumbs have been absent ever since. So while this patch has reignited hype around a potential Prototype remaster, a sad side effect is that mods for the game appear to have been broken by this update. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">crucial mods like PrototypeFix</a>, which resolves crashing issues on modern hardware, have been updated and now work without issue.</p>
<p>If you've not played Prototype, why not check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prototype-review">Eurogamer's old Prototype review</a>. In it, Tom Bramwell wrote: "Prototype is a game of riotous, gore-splattering ultraviolence. That's all it wants to be, and in many respects it does a solid, and often spectacular job. The victims may be plot, atmosphere and the difficulty curve, but then great power always comes at a cost."</p>

Shortly after updating their ocean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> story <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soma-devs-frictional-release-video-of-something-new-aka-their-nice-hotel-game-in-which-nothing-awful-will-happen">Soma</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amnesia-creators-frictional-are-teasing-what-could-be-soma-2-through-a-sinister-luxury-hotel-website">an in-game teaser</a> - an old-school marketing ARG! By gar, it's been a while - Amnesia developers Frictional have put out a brief untitled video of "something new". It's a series of perspectives of what I assume is their new game's science fiction setting. To adopt the appropriate Jungian terminology, it looks creepy as balls. I am looking forward to this soma-ch. Without further ado, that trailer.

<p>
You might recognise the setting from the <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">weirdo luxury hotel website</a> featured in the previous teaser. The website's About section describes the hotel as follows: "Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond. Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing, Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious. In Samsara, wishes will come true. Interested in investing?" 
</p>
<p>
A slapdash inventory of things seen and heard in the teaser: floating flecks, fidgeting shadows, artful flourescent ceiling lights and corner moulding, cables, barcodes, cushioned walls, folding metal shutters, biohazard symbols, blood. Also an echoing, ethereal voice that sounds like it's coming from a speaker. I can't quite make out what the voice is saying, but it sounds like the closing words are "no sense". Yes, more of this please. Sense is overrated.
</p><p>
The sci-fi stylings together with the preceding in-game teaser - which went live on Soma's tenth birthday, 22nd September - strongly suggest that this is a Soma sequel. Please see my last article for speculations about Hotel Samsara and the website. I am too frazzled to recap them. Are we going to outer space in this one?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski never really hid his utter disdain for gaming in general. This was perhaps only exacerbated by the famous dispute with Polish developer CD Projekt RED: originally, the author sold the videogaming rights for a relative pittance, thinking they would never really be that successful. </p>



<p>Following The Witcher III: Wild Hunt's immense success, however, Sapkowski <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million in royalty payments</a> despite the fact that the deal they had previously struck did not mention any royalty fees at all. Eventually, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement with the creator of The Witcher</a> that purportedly satisfied both parties.</p>



<p>Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Reddit AMA on the Fantasy subreddit</a>, Sapkowski returned to criticize CD Projekt's games, specifically on their 'completely unnecessary' expansion of the concept of Witcher schools. Here's the relevant quote:  </p>



<p><em>The issue of "witcher schools" requires—I apologise—a longer explanation. A single sentence about some "school of the Wolf" mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these "witcher schools." Completely unnecessary.</em></p>



<p><em>I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation. Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I'll erase the sentence about the "school" from future editions of The Last Wish. Or maybe I'll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit.</em></p>



<p>It is quite obvious that Sapkowski never played CD Projekt's The Witcher games, as their schools are really nothing like Harry Potter's Houses. Anyway, the writer later replied to a question about adaptations in general, once again claiming the inherent superiority of the written word to images, 'animated or otherwise':</p>



<p><em>Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here. Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Sapkowski is entitled to his opinion, though it clearly appears to stem from a strong bias. For its part, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still plans to incorporate some concepts from the author's latest book</a>, Crossroads of Ravens, in the upcoming game The Witcher IV (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be released before 2027</a>).</p>

<figure data-uuid="bd12a019bd879"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd12a019bd879/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out this week, and in case you missed it, it comes with all sorts of enhancements. Apart from the resolution boost on the Switch 2, the game also supports the system's Joy-Con 2 mouse mode feature, which is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Before you jump in and try this out, there's one thing you might want to know. This mode can only be accessed in the 'Co-Star Mode' with a second player. Here's the full rundown about this from our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890gryjum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to experience mouse mode on a single-player run, it seems you're out of luck. You'll need to call on a friend, family member, or someone else if you want to properly test it out. Once again, this control mode in these new versions is only accessible to Switch 2 users.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be made available on 2nd October, with fans also able to purchase each game separately from the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this week, Nintendo has released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> on the Switch.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo's official support page, Version 1.2.2 addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience. It doesn't go into any details beyond this, but if we find out what is going on behind the scenes here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Compatibility with existing versions is also noted, so be mindful of that. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.2 (Released September 30, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Does have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.1-1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player’s system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major update for this same title in June</a>, which optimised the game's visuals and frame rate for the Switch 2.

<p>Expect improved FPS, load times and more</p>

<figure data-uuid="d04ea720d106d"><a title="Warframe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d04ea720d106d/warframe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Extremes (via Steam)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, the team at Digital Extremes provided a development update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> - confirming a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title was officially in the works.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game, now that they've finally got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the official stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently target 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information just yet about when exactly the Switch 2 version of Warframe will be released, but when we hear more, we'll be sure to let you know. Warframe was made available for the original Switch in 2018. The port specialists at Panic Button helped out with this version of the game at the time, and we labelled it a "remarkable technical feat" for Nintendo's hybrid system.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99ve-been-playing-town-to-city-from-dawn-to-dusk.1313095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello there, fans of city-builders and/or idyllic 19th-century Mediterranean getaways! You two very specific groups of people need to know that I spent the entire weekend playing<em> Town To City </em>and did little else, because I couldn't stop playing <em>Town To City</em>.</p><p>It's a game that shows the people of its world, much like our own, tired of the brutalities of modern industrial life and yearning for greener pastures. So it puts you in charge of those pastures, a town where a steady stream of treechangers arrive at a train station seeking a new life, and it's your job to first build them a house, and then put them to work.</p><p>Zooming out to survey everything you're able and asked to do in this game, <em>Town To City </em>looks like a city-builder. People's homes and jobs create numbers which then impact other stuff, there is happiness to worry about, warehouses to distribute resources to and from and shopfronts which draw on a complicated supply network of farms and granaries that you're given full control over. If your idea of city-building is to get lost in the numbers, managing a settlement's nerve centre and making sure its connections and creations all intertwine and sing in harmony, <em>Town To City </em>absolutely lets you play like that.</p><p>Zoom in, though, and there are huge sections of <em>Town To City</em> where you're not really city-building at all, and everything feels closer to<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> or <em>Townscaper</em> than <em>SimCity</em>. Through a combination of the game's flexible voxel graphics and a creation suite more interested in painting than laying along grids, <em>Town To City </em>lets you spend countless hours just...being creative. I lost track of the amount of time I spent making little bendy roads up hillsides, planting little hedge parks in between houses, putting flowerpots on people's balconies and planting flags where needed, not because it was important (though it can be, because your inhabitants’ happiness is linked to the aesthetics of their neighbourhood), but just because I thought it looked nice.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Town to City | Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMXIUgRoqTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What makes the game so good is the way both these halves politely respect each other's contributions and boundaries. If four families arrive in town at once and need somewhere to live, you obviously need to build them a house, but if you want to spend an hour designing the perfect cul de sac for them all first, planting every decorative shrub in their yards and agonising over the placement of every single lamp adorning their walls, you can do that. They won't complain, or get cold, or <em>starve</em>, or leave; they'll just patiently wait for you to be done, <em>then </em>you can move them in.</p><p>Unpopular shops won't lead to crime, unhappy people don't riot, empty houses don't rot or catch fire. You're basically never hassled. This isn't the real world, these aren't real people, the game knows these are dolls with some needs. You're here to build a dollhouse, and if it takes you three hours to get a family out of the cold and into a farmhouse then they're not only cool with it, they'll appreciate your effort once you do.</p><p>For me, this is everything that's good about city-builders (a sandbox, a plaything, a set of numbers to mess around with) and nothing I hate about them (the stress of having bad things happen to you or the things you make). It creates a frictionless experience; you're always building but never having to rework (unless you want to!), always expanding but never circling back because you made a logistical mistake.</p><figure><figcaption>I made everyone a nice little park, not because I had to, just because it's nice</figcaption></figure><p>The game's dual focus--the grander designs of your town at one end of the zoom lens, the <em>Sims</em>-like attention to each individual household at the other--made me prouder of my towns than I think I've ever been of any town or city, in any game, ever. I had made all of it. From the widest boulevard outside a towering cathedral to the placement of each park bench and individual flowerpot.</p><p>For a game with such a chill vibe, I felt strangely all-powerful, more godlike than I'd felt playing games where I'd been a literal god. Though not in a cackling, vengeful god way; just a warm, glowing, benevolent way, like I was putting in six days of work before I could rest on the seventh and watch everyone go buy some eggs and play hopscotch.</p><p>Does all this cosiness and coddling rob the game of any sense of peril? Of course it does. If you're into games like <a href="https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Frostpunk</em></a><em> </em>because you like the feeling of playing a video game with a gun to your head, you might hate <em>Town To City</em>. It's more polite than Canadians lining up at a line shop, and I suppose there's an argument that at some level a city-builder requires some element of threat, otherwise it just becomes a game about building stuff.</p><p>But that's exactly what I love about <em>Town To City</em>. It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores. It's given me everything I love from this genre and tossed out everything I don't, then played some wonderfully soothing accordion music over the top, just for good measure.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Town To City</em> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115220/Town_to_City/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out in Early Access on Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a life-long lover of sci-fi battle scenes, it is always a joy to order a fleet of dozens of starships of all shapes and sizes to hyper-jump to a neighboring planet, then zoom in and watch as they burst into existence on the other side, bearing down on the entrenched enemy as they scramble fighters and bring their guns to bear. It’s something we’ve seen play out many times in Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and more, though few games let you control warfare between interstellar powers on the scale of Sins of a Solar Empire 2. It often takes hours of slow and steady management across layers of intimidatingly complex grand strategy systems to build up to those major confrontations, but the payoff is spectacular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The important thing to know going in is that while this is a bewilderingly complicated real-time strategy/4X hybrid that lets you zoom from a view of an entire solar system down to an individual spaceship in a fleet of hundreds, you do not need to know everything about it to have a good time with it, or even win. I should know – after a few dozen hours playing largely against Unfair (the setting above hard) AI opponents, mostly in four-way free-for-alls, I’ve won more than I’ve lost even though I still have a lot to learn about the many, many differences both large and subtle between the six playable factions and how their fleets, structures, and upgrades interact. Unless you’re in this to mostly play at a high level against human opponents who’ve optimized their build orders and mastered the mechanics, once you get your head around the basics of building your economy, research, and fleet management, I’ve found that you can lean into the aspects that you enjoy most and all but ignore things you aren’t interested in, and still enjoy building your empire and crushing enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fundamentally, all six of Sins 2’s playable factions operate in a fairly similar way in that they all colonize planets, extract resources, build orbital structures for research and production, and have similar lineups of corvettes, frigates, cruisers, and capital ships, but beyond that their differences are significant and complex as hell. The two human TEC factions both generate money in part by setting up networks of trading outposts, but they come with different upgrades and bonuses that makes Enclave better suited for a defensive playstyle and Primacy more aggressive – among them, the Novalith Cannon superweapon that can bombard planets from across the solar system and the ability to earn money by sending in raiders. The Vasari Alliance, meanwhile, have no use for the TEC’s money at all and are focused on diplomacy with minor factions that let them periodically call in favors like reinforcements or upgrades, while their Exodus counterparts are the only faction that can completely destroy planets as they strip them for resources. The Advent Reborn and Wrath are big on resurrecting destroyed ships and mind-controlling enemies, respectively. All of that is a gross oversimplification, of course, but in the interest of avoiding turning this review into a mirror of the <a href="https://wiki.sinsofasolarempire2.com/space/SSEFW/1684832258/Guides" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>massive guides to each faction</u></a> on the official site, rest assured that they’re pretty distinct. The list of unique technologies and items they all have access to means there’s a lot of replayability here just from trying out each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played the classic 2008 Sins of a Solar Empire (or its half-step sequel Rebellion) Sins 2 may seem a bit unambitious when you first begin – at least, after you’ve stopped gawking at how much better and shinier all the ships look in an updated game engine that can handle cool things like all the rotating, target-tracking turrets you could ask for. It really does look spectacular when major battles are joined and the lasers and missiles start flying, but it takes a while to get to that point. The early hours of Sins 2 play very similarly to its 17-year-old predecessor: the routine of starting from a single world, exploring the map around you with automated scouts, and racing to colonize every planet and asteroid you can clear of local defenses with your chosen starting flagship and small fleet (as you research the technologies required to inhabit each planet type) is for the most part indistinguishable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main new wrinkle is presented by an exotic materials system that limits how quickly you can ramp up high-powered military assets like capital ships and starbases, but later on this becomes kind of irrelevant. At first they’re hard to come by, and you have to either unearth random ones from planets and asteroids you colonize or destroy enemy capital ships and salvage them – and because most major ships and starbases require a specific material, you may have to improvise with what’s available rather than go with your favorite ships out of the gate, which adds some variety from game to game. Eventually, though, you can research the ability to build refineries that slowly produce exotics out of the standard resources of metal and crystal you’ve extracted, and then you can build whatever you like – it’ll even auto-research the technologies and then produce the materials if you have the resources available, so all exotics really do after that point is add to build times. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When you reach the midgame, Sins 2 really starts showing off what makes it different from the original by layering on so many different systems that I had to play multiple, hours-long games before I came close to engaging with them all. Even having gone through an in-depth series of tutorials (there’s no traditional RTS story campaign in which to learn the ropes) and after over more than 40 hours of practice, it’s an overwhelming amount of things to keep track of: two parallel research trees with multiple paths, numerous planetary upgrades, buildable items you can equip on your individual capital ships and worlds, simple diplomacy with both player-controlled factions and independent worlds, culture expansion, resource management, pirate raids, other faction-specific mechanics like trade routes and castable powers, and unique Titan superships, among others. With the default settings, planets will even slowly orbit the sun in the center of the map at different rates, which sounds interesting but can be annoying if you forget to check the movement preview for a while and suddenly one of your worlds has drifted to the middle of enemy territory and is cut off from reinforcements. (It is, however, very funny when this happens to someone else.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that matter, everything in Sins 2 appears to be moving slowly when you’re watching a fleet glide across a planet’s gravity well before jumping to the next or a progress bar for research or construction fill up, but it’s deceptive in that there’s virtually always something you can be doing to improve your empire. Once you figure out which menus to peruse to manage equipment on individual planets, capital ships, and starbases, view and expand available build slots on your planets, search for which of the dozens of technologies to research next, keep tabs on your economy growth, and more, it can feel like things are moving too quickly to do all of that and build fleets to send on lengthy journeys to where they’re needed to defend or attack. It’s workable because the tools for organizing fleets are simple and mostly intuitive, with improvements such as letting you build reinforcements directly from a fleet’s menu instead of seeking out a shipyard, but I’m still glad that I’m allowed to pause time (in single-player) to figure things out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a good thing that you don’t really have to micromanage your ships in combat if you don’t want to. You’ll certainly get more out of your battleships if you’re zooming in to manually do things like send out swarms of nanites to do damage over time, restore allies’ shields, or launch a massive missile salvo at a particularly bothersome enemy ship, but they’ll also auto-cast those abilities for you by default (as long as you’ve taken the time to choose which ones to unlock when a ship levels up). Similarly, precise positioning certainly matters because you can do things like keep your vulnerable ships outside the firing range of a starbase or stationary defensive turrets, and it’s always wise to try to save your experienced capital ships to fight another day by withdrawing from a fight before they’re destroyed (you’ll get frequent notifications when their shields are down or their hull is crippled, so it’s hard to miss those opportunities). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But those maneuvers matter most when you’re fighting an equally matched opponent, and the key to victory is to never do that if you don’t have to: wars are won on a logistical level by making sure your fleet is well supplied and fully upgraded, and has a good composition of light frigates and heavy cruisers along with speedy fighters, corvettes, and long-range support craft all backing up your capital ships. All the micromanagement in the world can only take you so far when you’re outnumbered two to one because your enemy had more shipyards and a more powerful economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, part of the reason I’ve been able to win most of my games without making full use of every tool at my disposal is because the rival empires’ AI tends to drop the ball in the late game. I’ve played multiple matches where enemy fleets would gang up on me by attacking on two fronts simultaneously and push me back to my core worlds, but then they’d back off while I still held enough territory to be able to rebuild my fleet. Eventually I was able to regroup and then steamroll them, even though they beat me to building the massive Titan warships at the very top of each faction’s tech tree. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s entirely possible that in these cases my opponents were too busy fighting each other to deal with me while I rebuilt my fleets, but the fact that neither took the time to deliver a killing blow to my home world and seize my territory when they had the chance seemed a little silly. Until that point, though, the AI puts up a good fight, with lots of opportunities for skirmishes and trading blows around border worlds.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, Sins of a Solar Empire 2 works best as a multiplayer game because humans would have no such trouble going for the jugular. However, in practice I’ve never been able to actually finish a multiplayer game because of how long and involved they are. Even a “small” game of Sins 2 with two players on one of the pre-built or randomly generated maps is sprawling, involving dozens of planets and other heavenly bodies to fight over, which can take hours against an opponent who knows better than to leave his homeworld undefended; a large one can actually have multiple solar systems you can jump between and up to 10 players, so it’s quite a commitment for a group to see one through. To its credit, Sins 2 does allow for players to easily jump in and out, with AI taking over control of a faction until a human returns to pick up the reins again so you won’t be left unfulfilled if your opponents have other obligations to attend to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this is before you get to the modding scene, which is busily churning out conversions that let you add Star Destroyers, Battlestars, and Romulan Warbirds (among many others) to the mix using the built-in mod manager. If the original Sins of a Solar Empire is anything to go by, that community will keep giving us new fan-pleasing toys to play with for a very long time – maybe even decades – to come.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sins of a Solar Empire 2 is a grand-scale real-time strategy game that asks that you keep up with its many complex systems for marathon sessions, but in return it gives you control over some of the most spectacular space battles in gaming. Ordering huge battleships, small fighters, and everything in between to launch all-out assaults on an enemy’s home world is a rewarding payoff for hours of navigating menus and keeping your eye on what feels like dozens of balls at once. Fully mastering the mechanics of its six factions will take many hours of tutorials, browsing guides, and watching explainer videos, but don’t let that intimidate you away from playing. Once you’ve learned the basics of making enough cash to buy a few spaceships, you can jump in and have a stellar time successfully conquering solar systems long before fully wrapping your head around all the nuances you’d need to compete in a multiplayer war. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

            <p>
The thing about an adaptation, is that sometimes you've got to twist things slightly to better do what you want to do. Whether that's the right choice or not depends on how militant you are about the concept of faithfulness. When it comes to The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher</a> series, however, I expect most people won't care, except for the author of the original books Andrzej Sapkowski himself. His personal gripe? The very existence of different witcher schools.
</p>
<p>
In The Witcher games, there's various Witcher schools that crop up here and there, with Geralt of Rivia coming from the School of the Wolf. Except according to a recent AMA with Sapkowski on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">PC Gamer</a>), the whole idea of schools was completely blown out of proportion. "The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski wrote. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot."
</p>
<p>
For some context, The Last Wish is the first book he wrote in the series. The author goes on to explain that he didn't include any references to any other schools in any of his other books from that point on. "However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools.' Completely unnecessary."
</p>
<p>
Sapkowski also noted how he's not sure how he wants to go about dispelling this idea of schools, suggesting removing any mention of them in future editions of The Last Wish, or even just outright expanding and clarifying the idea in future books. "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."
</p><p>
I have to admit, this does tickle me quite a bit. I'm not a mega Witcher fan, I enjoyed the third one enough, but the schools did feel important enough to be relatively memorable. And they're just not really a thing apparently!
</p>
<p>
Ultimately Sapkowski's comments don't really matter as the games have obviously taken on a very large life of their own. I doubt there'll be anyone at CD Projekt Red who's going to lose any sleep over this either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there was meant to be one last Witcher 3 patch this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">but that recently got the boot to 2026</a>. I'm sure you can wait a while longer for your cross-platform mod support.
