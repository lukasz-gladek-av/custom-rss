Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Game Studios are releasing two <em>Tomb Raider</em> games back-to-back in 2026 and 2027. First up, coming in 2026 is <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>. Don’t let the fancy name fool you though, <em>Legacy of Atlantis</em> is the Unreal Engine 5 version of the first <em>Tomb Raider</em> game, a remake similar to <em>Tomb Raider Anniversary</em> which updated the 1997 original PlayStation game for the PS2.</p><p>But that’s not all. In 2027, the<em> Tomb Raider</em> team will release another game, <em>Tomb Raider Catalyst </em>which is an all new adventure that looks like it features an all new Lara. Real <em>Tomb Raider</em> heads know that Lara Croft was originally envisioned as Laura Cruz, a South American woman, before she was British-ed her up to what we know today. The woman in <em>Catalyst </em>looks like a Lara paying homage to her origins as a woman of color. We don’t know much about either game, but hey, I’ll never be mad that I’m getting <em>two</em> new <em>Tomb Raiders </em>to play.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/843260/tomb-raider-catalyst-trailer-tomb-raider-atlantis]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/843265/apple-epic-games-tim-sweeney-interview</link>
            <guid>1381075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Shortly after appeals court judges ruled against Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/842991/apple-epic-appeal-loses-contempt">contempt appeal</a> in a years-long antitrust dispute against the makers of <em>Fortnite,</em> I got to talk to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney in an interview. According to Sweeney, today’s ruling “completely shuts down” Apple’s App Store rules that allow it to collect “junk fees.”</p><p>The three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed an April ruling that Apple failed to comply with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown">2021 order</a> allowing app developers to link to external payment options, which Sweeney said “... is really awesome for all developers.”</p><p>Perhaps the most notable part of the appeals court ruling is that the panel is asking Gonzalez Rogers to look at ways Apple could charge developers reasonable fees for purchases made in apps using outside payment links. In her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April ruling</a>, Gonzalez Rogers blocked Apple from taking <em>any</em> fees from external payments because of decisions like slapping external payments with a 27 percent fee and forcing developers to make their payments links in plain text.</p><p>But the appeals court says Apple “should” be able to charge a fee based on “the costs that are genuinely and reasonably necessary for its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases, but no more” and that Apple is “entitled to some compensation for the use of its intellectual property that is directly used in permitting Epic and others to consummate linked-out purchases.”</p><p>“If you want to have an app go through review with custom linkouts, maybe there’s several hundred dollars of fees associated with that every time you submit an app, which is perfectly reasonable because there are real people at Apple doing those things and Apple pays them, and we should be contributing to that,” Sweeney says. But he says that the ruling, “completely shuts down, I think, for all time, Apple’s theory that they should be able to charge arbitrary junk fees for access.”</p><p>With these two areas that Apple would be allowed to charge for, Sweeney says that “I can’t imagine any justification for a percentage of developer revenue being assessed here.”</p><p>Weeks after the April ruling, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store"><em>Fortnite</em> returned to the US App Store</a> — nearly five years after Apple originally kicked it off when Epic introduced its own in-app purchase system to <em>Fortnite.</em> And there are efforts globally to require Apple to allow third-party app stores on iOS, like the Digital Markets Act in Europe, which is the reason you can get <em>Fortnite</em> from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">mobile Epic Games Store</a> in that region.</p><p>“So far, Apple has taken the strategy of collecting junk fees and every territory until they’re forced by law enforcers or regulators to stop,” Sweeney says. “I’m not sure if they’re going to continue that until they’ve lost every single battle around the entire world, or if they are at some point going to harmonize their global policies. I certainly hope that Apple would, at some point, just try to come to a soft landing and have a single worldwide policy that works for everybody.”</p><p>Sweeney expects that the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26372151-epic-v-apple-appeals-court-opinion/">Ninth Circuit’s opinion</a> will unblock “a lot” of regulatory efforts around the world. “Why on earth would any self-respecting country in the world allow Apple to charge fees that the United States court has found to be illegal in the United States?” he says.</p><p>The ruling wasn’t the only big news for Epic and <em>Fortnite</em> on mobile today: the game also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/842855/fortnite-android-google-play">returned to Google Play in the US</a> after similarly being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation">booted by Google</a> when Epic added the in-app payments system to <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic and Google announced last month that they have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement">agreed to settle their lawsuit</a>, and while the two sides are still seeking court approval for their settlement, it resolves their disputes worldwide.</p><p>“I’ve been very impressed with the new generation of the Android leadership,” Sweeney says. “They turned over a new leaf here.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/843265/apple-epic-games-tim-sweeney-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "future of Tomb Raider" has been dutifully revealed at this year's Geoff Awards, and it turns out the future is half-future, half-past. Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics have announced a pair of Tomb Raider games - Tomb Raider: Catalyst, the next major new instalment in Lara Croft's adventures, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-the-next-tomb-raider-reboot-project-going-by-alleged-trailer-leak">previously leaked</a> Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, "a fully reimagined version" of Core Design's original Tomb Raider from 1996.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let’s start with Catalyst. It’s been in development at Crystal Dynamics since they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">partnered with Amazon Game Studios back in 2022</a>, and is set in Northern India following “a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them”. Lara is racing various cackling badniks to claim yet another mighty treasure with the apparent power to reshape the geography underfoot. “As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future,” the press release declares. Here’s a video.</p>

<p>It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be the “largest Tomb Raider world yet”, with all the forgotten crypts and puzzles one might expect of a game featuring Indiana Jones’s sister from another mother. (Dear precious commenters, please find a way to make that rhyme - it’s 3am here and there is no poetry left in my bloodstream.) It’ll launch in 2027 for PC via Steam.</p><p>Before that, though, you’ll be able to play Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which is being developed by Crystal and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-warrior">Shadow Warrior</a> devs Flying Wild Hog. This also runs in Unreal Engine 5, and boasts of “new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game”. You’ll once again be hunting for the Scion, another momentous McGuffin that must be kept out of dastardly hands, and yes, the dinosaurs are still in it. Ah, my friend the T-Rex. It has been too long since you last chased me screaming around that cave. Look out for these and other hand-Crofted pseudo-vintage delights via Steam in 2026.</p>

<p>Both the Catalyst and Legacy Of Atlantis incarnations of Croft are being voiced by Alix Wilton Regan - aka the female Inquisitor in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, also known for roles in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>It's been a very rough time for Crystal Dynamics this year, with three rounds of layoffs in swift succession. The last of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">came in November</a>, when the studio announced that "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" had been let go.</p><p>Naturally, the press release for Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis paints a rosier picture, with Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos commenting that "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise." As for the remake, Wild Hog CEO Michał Szustak assures that "we’re expanding the universe while staying loyal to what fans have always loved." Time for another volcanic argument about tank controls, I guess. Games aside, Amazon are also working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phoebe-fleabag-waller-bridge-is-writing-a-tomb-raider-tv-show-for-amazon">TV adaptation of Lara's adventures</a>.</p>

        <ul><li><strong>Face the Lord of Hatred</strong> –&nbsp;In the aftermath of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, this next chapter drives players toward their final stand against Mephisto, whose deception and spreading influence threaten to twist Sanctuary into a world consumed by malice. As Hell’s legions surge and the ancient Pools of Creation draw Mephisto ever closer, the fate of humanity hangs by a thread. To stop him, the <a title="Games > Wanderer [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/wanderer">Wanderer</a> must embrace an old foe long believed to be dead.

And on December 11<strong>,</strong> following The Game Awards, Blizzard will officially unveil the Paladin as we enter the lead-up to the launch of <em>Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred </em>expansion on April 28, 2026.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Paladin</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Guided by the Light</strong> – The Paladin is Sanctuary’s quintessential holy warrior: a sword-and-shield champion empowered not only by faith, but by the Light itself. More than mere armored knights, Paladins are forged as holy conduits. When their unwavering devotion joins with the Light, the two become an unstoppable force against the darkness.<ul><li>Built on beloved mechanics that have shaped the Paladin identity, the class brings forth iconic abilities with fresh, new skills. Classic skills like Auras, Blessed Hammer, Blessed Shield, and Zeal return with a revitalized feel that blends <em>Diablo II </em>nostalgia with the visceral combat and grounded visual style of <em>Diablo IV</em>. Where Crusaders embody martial might, the Paladin leans fully into divine power.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Honoring the Legacy</strong> – The Paladin carries more than 25 years of Diablo legacy, and in <em>Lord of Hatred</em>, they return as Sanctuary’s last beacon of divine authority. As Mephisto’s corruption spreads, Paladins answer the call with unwavering devotion, turning the battlefield into sanctified ground.<ul><li>While Auras and Holy Conjurations honor the class’s storied past, <em>Lord of Hatred </em>pushes the power fantasy further than ever before. Through angelic transformation, players can ascend into the Arbiter form, a radiant, <a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a>ael-inspired avatar of celestial justice.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Key Design Pillars</strong> – The Paladin is built on three foundational pillars:<ul><li><strong>The Indomitable Guardian</strong> –&nbsp;An immovable protector empowered by faith. Shield in hand and Light at their back, Paladins defend the innocent and stand unbroken against overwhelming evil.</li><li><strong>The Divine Armory</strong> – Classic medieval weaponry—sword, shield, armor, and holy hammers—define the Paladin’s martial identity. But beyond wielding these tools, Paladins conjure and empower them with celestial force, transforming classic medieval weaponry into holy instruments of judgment.</li><li><strong>The Holy Conduit</strong> – A living bridge between Heaven and Sanctuary, the Paladin harnesses the Light as raw power. This manifests through a spectrum of radiant VFX—not just gold—supported by weighty, thunderous sound and animation that makes every strike feel like it hits with might.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Combat and Skills</strong> -As a classic sword-and-board class, the Paladin’s skills reinforce strength, faith, and overwhelming divine impact. Iconic favorites–Auras, Blessed Hammer, Blessed Shield, Condemn, Zeal, and Heaven’s Fury–return with new animation, sound, and responsiveness. The class also reintroduces the long-beloved <strong>Holy damage</strong> type, creating a clear identity in both power fantasy and mechanics. New abilities further channel celestial energy and holy magic, making each attack feel unwavering, weighty, and unmistakably empowered by Heaven.</li><li><strong>Oath System</strong> –&nbsp;The Oath System is a defining class mechanic for the Paladin. It is a set of sacred paths that reflect the codes of chivalry and faith-driven identity Paladins swear to uphold. Each Oath rewards players for leaning fully into a distinct playstyle, deepening both fantasy and buildcraft.<ul><li>Juggernaut focuses on the Paladin’s shield, turning defense into offensive movement with Shield Bash as the primary skill. The ultimate move, Fortress, is a defensive-focused skill that briefly makes the player exceptionally difficult to kill.</li><li>Zealot is a frenzied melee powered by an updated Zeal skill. Where Juggernaut is the “board,” this is the “sword.” With Zenith as the ultimate, this Oath unleashes a devastating celestial strike that cleaves the battlefield with a massive holy blade.</li><li>Judicator brings holy judgment and wrath, using the holy conjurations of Blessed Shield, Hammer, Consecration, and Heaven’s Fury, raining divine punishment upon all that is wicked.</li><li>Disciple is the ultimate angelic transformation, fully embracing divinity in its purest form. Unleash the lance with Spears of the Heavens onto enemies and take flight with your angel wings in the Arbiter Form.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Paladin returns not just as a new class, but as the ultimate expression of faith, legacy, and righteous power at a pivotal moment in Sanctuary’s history.</p></blockquote><p><em>Diablo IV</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,438 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,585 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [14,342 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-iv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battle.net</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p dir="ltr">A short but sweet new preorder trailer for Housemarque's highly anticipated third-person shooter Saros was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">featured</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> on December 11.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer didn't tell us much we didn't see from the previous trailer, there's still an eclipse, Rahul Kohli being handsome and angsty, and a whole lot of projectiles and tentacles. What's definitely new, however, is where it ended: on a new release date of April 30, 2026, pushed back from the original date of March 20.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmsc_GokLPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, Saros looks like a pretty straightforward follow-up to Returnal, but it features a number of gameplay differences that pull it further away from roguelite territory. Resources and progression are not lost upon death in Saros, though the world will still be altered, providing a unique experience each run. It stars Rahul Kohli, known for Midnight Mass, The Electric State, and more.</p>

                <p>Sometimes you get caught on camera at something like a baseball game, and your face is forever immortalized with whatever cheese or grimace you made. Ben Starr understood that as, when the camera cut to him during a The Game Awards segment, the prolific voice actor gave a wry smile and two thumbs up. And honestly, it might just be the perfect meme to encapsulate this whole year.</p><p>Digital Extremes' community director Megan Everett and creative director Rebecca Ford took to the stage to talk about the free-to-play shooter-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warframe/" data-ref-id="5000-145693">Warframe</a>. While discussing how they're not there to announce that the game is out of open beta after 12 years of development, Ford shot directly at Starr because the only thing they learned in 12 years is that he'll "do anything for money."</p><p>Cue to Starr, cascaded in a red hue as he gives a slight smile and a double thumbs-up in what could easily be a Call of Duty or Fortnite emote. And he held the pose for a while, too; in fact, he sat there for about four seconds. That doesn't sound that long, but when you've got millions of eyes on you at once, it can feel like an eternity.</p><p>This isn't <a href="https://x.com/sevenblades/status/1999285479129452547" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the first time Starr was caught red-handed on camera</a> at The Game Awards. In 2023, he was captured with a blindingly bright light in his face that absolutely washed out his complexion. There was also another year where Starr was snapped with a somewhat darker exposure that made him look dull. I guess Charlie Kelly's rock opera from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia about the "Day Man" and the "Night Man" has come true, though I suppose you'll have to add "Red Man" in there, too. Now, I wonder if we'll get a Method Man from Starr.</p><p>Digression aside, Ben Starr's face is exactly how we all probably feel as 2025 comes to a close. With the job market contracting, the AI bubble seemingly poised to burst, layoffs rocking the games industry left and right, and a never-ending flow of horrific global news, you can't help but wryly smile and thumbs-up through it all. What's the Pepe the Frog quote? Right: "Feels good, man." Except it doesn't. It actually all feels bad.</p><p>Enough dourness, though, as we're here for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7341">announcements</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">awards</a> from The Game Awards.

Housemarque's forthcoming sci-fi shooter Saros has received a new trailer at tonight's The Game Awards, as well as a slight delay.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-housemarques-returnal-follow-up-saros-out-next-march">Sony previously announced the game would be out on 20th March next year</a>, but now it's set for 30th April.
</p>
<p>
Below is the new trailer showing more of the game's story - and Jane Perry returns!

<p>
Perry was Selene in the studio's previous game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, so it's great to see her back in a new role.
</p>

<p>
"Saros is the haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse," reads the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/saros-out-april-30-new-trailer-reveals-gameplay-story-details/">PlayStation Blog</a>. "You play as Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who will stop at nothing to find who he is looking for."
</p>
<p>
There's an ensemble cast this time around, and seemingly more of an emphasis on story. There's also a mysterious corridor to explore, presumably a bit like the home in Returnal.
</p>
<p>
As for the studio's "bullet ballet", Saros has a new parry move to bounce back all those neon shots. It's looking brilliant!

		<p>Rahul Kohli introduced a new story trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>, Housemarque’s roguelite shooter successor coming out on 30th April 2026 for PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s an intriguing element here with, as Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli), is not alone here. He’s led a team of Soltari Enforcers to this planet, but for some reason they’re now trapped here in a time loop with a dying sun. This is a…. stressful situation and they’re not handling it all too well in the trailer.</p>
<p>From what we’ve seen in previous trailer and reveals, the gameplay structure will be pretty familiar. It’s a roguelike third person shooter, very much in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>, with a permanent progression system wrapped around individual runs that reshape the world and give you new upgrade possibilities to find on the next attempt.</p>
<p>The action looks a bit faster than Returnal, though this may be my imagination, with more sprinting and dashing. Arjun comes with a Soltari Shield that can absorb and reflect projectives, using them to feel the Power Weapon, an Eclipse-driven weapon.</p>

<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

		<p>James Bond will be facing a piratical villain in 007: First Light as rock legend Lenny Kravitz steps in the world of video games in his first role. He will play as Bawma, “the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who’s as charismatic as he is unpredictable.”</p>
<p><iframe title="007 First Light – Lenny Kravitz Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hT1kFDUmu_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>007: First Light is coming out on 27th March 2026&nbsp;across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>The game is IOI’s first outside the Hitman series for quite a while, and as a licensed IP of this scale, it’s a pretty big deal for the studio. The story sees James Bond as a relative newcomer to MI6, working as part of a team as they race to catch and foil the plans of 009, who’s gone just a little bit rogue.</p>
<p>Last time out we saw a mission to intercept 009 at a chess tournament, showcasing the game’s evolved stealth action gameplay, before leading into a high speed car chase and then deadly combat as Bond chases his target to a fleeing cargo plane. Would you believe that the plane doesn’t have a smooth take off and landing?</p>

<p>We had an early preview of the gameplay reveal back at Gamescom and had the opportunity to speak with Franchise Art Director Rasmus Poulsen. Here’s a little tidbit, as we discuss Bond’s visits to Q Lab and whether they’re more Desmond Llewelyn or Ben Wishaw. “We have quite a bit of humour everywhere, but it’s important to mention that it is, first and foremost, a reasonably dry British wit, because otherwise it doesn’t feel quite like it belongs. And, you know, you’ll get to a Q lab and you’ll get to understand how that relationship was formed in that surprising way, I would say, so look forward to that!”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>

		<p>Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog have announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis a reimagining and remake of Lara’s original adventure. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">an original game expected in 2027</a>, Legacy of Atlantis will arrive in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Tomb Raider has been revisited a good few times over the years. Originally released in 1996, Tomb Raider: Anniversary was released in 2007, a PS3 era remake that came early on in Crystal Dynamics’ tenure as the franchise developer.</p>
<p>Now we’re entering into a new era for Tomb Raider, with Amazon acting as publisher after Crystal Dynamics was sold off by Square Enix a few years ago. A remake tends to be an easy go-to for publishers to greenlight and developers to refind a series’ core and often make a jump to a new game engine – usually Unreal Engine, let’s be honest. It will be interesting to see how faithful and how reimagined this game ends up being.</p>
<p>Want some blurb to pad the word count? Yeah, let’s have that.</p>

<p><em>As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time—from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether you’re a veteran raider or new to Lara’s world, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis delivers jaw-dropping visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises, while honoring the spirit and atmosphere of Lara Croft’s debut adventure.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-spoils-007-first-light-villain-ahead-of-the-game-awards-2025/">After it leaked earlier today</a> from the official 007 First Light account, IO Interactive has now officially announced that Lenny Kravitz is stepping into the role of Bawma, and appears to be the main antagonist that James Bond will face in the plot of 007 First Light.</p>



<p>While fans of Kravitz will know that this is not his first time stepping into a role as an actor, it does appear to be his first time acting in a video game. This makes 007 First Light a new frontier for Kravitz in a couple of ways, since this is also seemingly his first time in the role of a villain.</p>



<p>And not just any villain, but a Bond villain to boot, with his own pet alligators he can use to threaten his enemies, as he appears to do so in the trailer shown at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new trailer takes us to a remote location called Aleph, a black market city in Africa built by Lenny Kravitz's pirate character, Bawma. It's unclear if this is where the story of IO Interactive's Bond ends, but it is definitely a stop along the way.</p>



<p>007 First Light is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">this coming March 27, 2026</a>.

<p>The new look at Lords of the Fallen II isn't the only news related to the franchise today.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight from developer TT Games got a brand new gameplay trailer and the reveal of its release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, as it is set to arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on May 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Initially announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">Gamescom's 2025 ONL Show</a>, Legacy of the Dark Knight was described as the "<em>definitive</em>" Batman story and experience, as it spans across Batman eras with the whimsical tone you'd expect from a LEGO game. </p>



<p>Tonight's gameplay and release date trailer is chock-full of that whimsical tone, and all the humour and gameplay variety that made every LEGO game from TT Games worth checking out for years. This latest entry, however, seems to add new layers of complexity to the gameplay and combat system. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Heroes &amp; Villains Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xciD-Vz6T_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>With the combat system, our goal has been to offer an experience that is different from previous LEGO and LEGO Batman games, while keeping the trademark LEGO movement and humor fans have come to love and expect</em>," writes TT Games community manager Gehan Amaranayke in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-out-may-29-2026-on-ps5/">PlayStation Blog post.</a> "<em>As groups of enemies grow larger and better-equipped, even Batman needs help. That’s where the other members of the DC Bat-Family come in</em>."</p>



<p>Amaranayke also points to another old classic aspect of LEGO games updated for Legacy of the Dark Knight. In most LEGO games, you can collect and swap between characters included in whatever franchise the LEGO game you're playing is based on. In Legacy of the Dark Knight, you can play as other Batman characters, though their differing abilities seem to go a little deeper than they do in previous games.</p>



<p><em>"Detective Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and Catwoman will join Batman throughout the campaign. Each partner has unique gadgets and abilities showcasing their special skills and distinctive personality in combat. You saw Jim Gordon’s foam sprayer in action when we first announced the game at Gamescom in Germany. In this new trailer, you’ll see Robin using his circus training acrobatics, Batgirl with her hackarang to bypass security systems and take remote control of machinery, and Nightwing joins the party in with his battle staff. You’ll also notice Catwoman calling on her feline friends to distract and attack enemies and using her whip and cartwheel kicks to take out the baddies.</em>"</p>



<p>All together, Legacy of the Dark Knight is looking like it has the potential to be the best LEGO game yet, which is a high bar considering more than a few of TT Games' titles are some of the best family oriented 3D action platforming experiences out there, even to this day.</p>

Amnesia developers Frictional have finally done the decent thing and confirmed their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soma-devs-frictional-release-video-of-something-new-aka-their-nice-hotel-game-in-which-nothing-awful-will-happen">much-teased</a> follow-up to Soma, the much-beloved/dreaded underwater sci-fi horror game from 2015. Revealed just now at the Geoffrey Awards, the new game is called Ontos, which appears to be the Greek word for "Being". It's set in some kind of creepy lunar mad science resort called Samsara, and it honestly reminds me more of Bioshock at a glance than Soma, even though it's set in outer space. That's partly because it has a noticeably chattier NPC cast.

There are a lot of talking heads in that trailer, for a project from the Amnesia devs. Admittedly, some of the talking heads are only half a head. There's also a talking... wall of rats? One of the less ratty, fully jaw-equipped NPCs is voiced by Stellan Skarsgård. It sounds like he wants you to experiment on yourself.
</p>
<p>
Plot? Well, you are Aditi Amani, and you've been invited to the Moon to investigate something your estranged dad did. "What begins as a search for answers quickly spirals into something far stranger," the blurb expounds. "As you delve deeper, guided by fragments of your father's past, you must confront disturbing revelations about the nature of reality- and your place in it.
</p><p>
"Your beliefs will be questioned, and you will be pushed far out of your comfort zone," it continues. "Choose your path and face the consequences." Don't wanna, Frictional! I know your methods. At least one of those paths is bound to be the domain of something I can't kill that makes my vision glitch out.
</p>
<p>
It's out for PC in 2026. There is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924520/ONTOS/">a Steam page</a>, from which we learn that Ontos "presents a gauntlet of chilling experiments and disturbing encounters that push the boundaries of both science and morality". It sounds like the game is a series of tests, each an existential dilemma "that will make you question the nature of the soul, suffering, and the very fabric of reality itself". 
</p>
<p>
"These trials are not just puzzles--they are provocations," the developers continue. I like you Frictional but I think you need to wind your neck in a little. Less grandly, the page characterises the game as "an immersive narrative with a tactile, systems-driven gameplay experience" in which you'll "scavenge materials, manipulate intricate machinery, and engage with analog systems requiring careful calibration and hands-on interaction".
</p>
<p>
I'm most attracted to the setting, which is "a vast, interconnected labyrinth built atop the ruins of a failed mining colony and an opulent hotel lost to time". It's divided between a bunch of warring philosophical factions, and features theatre stages, caves, casinos and laboratories. Again, definitely getting some Bioshock energy from this. In a promising way.

              <p><em>Tomb Raider</em> is back in a big way. At the 2025 Game Awards, Amazon Game Studios revealed trailers for not one, but two new, upcoming <em>Tomb Raider</em> games starring Lara Croft.</p> <p>The first game shown off during the awards show was <em>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</em>, a new adventure starring a redesigned Lara Croft that seems to have connections to the past <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tomb-raider-definitive-survivor-trilogy"><em>Survivor Trilogy</em> version</a>.</p> <p>Here’s the trailer for <em>Catalyst</em>, which arrives sometime in 2027:</p>  <p>After revealing the new <em>Tomb Raider</em> sequel, we also got a trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tomb-raider-game-details-leak-and-it-looks-like-a-reboot-2000652612">the previously leaked <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em></a>, a full-on, big-budget remake of the original Tomb Raider game that appears to have connections to the <em>Survivor Trilogy</em> and <em>Catalyst.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Here’s the trailer for <em>Legacy of Atlantis</em>:</p>  <p>We don’t know much about Catalyst, but the remake,<em> Legacy of Atlantis,</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Here’s how Amazon describes it:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em> is a stunning reimagining of the 1996 genre-defining game. As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time—from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power.</p></blockquote> <p>In both trailers, it seems like we are getting a more classic Lara, complete with dual pistols, confidence, and that cool move where she lifts herself up slowly while climbing on a ledge. Oh, and dinosaurs are back in <em>Legacy of Atlantis.</em> And now they have feathers. Truly, a modern spin on the classic game.</p> <p><em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em> is out in 2026. <em>Catalyst</em> is out in 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During The Game Awards, Blizzard unveiled Diablo 4’s upcoming Lord of Hatred expansion, scheduled to drop on April 28, 2026. The trailer, which was in typical cinematic fashion for a Blizzard reveal, showcased Mephisto, otherwise known as the Lord of Hatred, and it offered a little glimpse at the new Paladin class, a ‘holy knight’ kind of character.</p>



<p>Check out the new Lord of Hatred trailer below.</p>







<h2 id="h-diablo-4-players-are-getting-two-new-classes">Diablo 4 Players Are Getting Two New Classes</h2>



<p>The next major expansion for Diablo 4 is dubbed Lord of Hatred, and it’s centered around Mephisto, one of the universe’s most terrifying and capable entities.</p>



<p>Blizzard revealed that the Paladin class is coming to Diablo 4 <strong>now</strong>, but it’s available exclusively to those who pre-order the new Lords of Hatred expansion. In the trailer content, a second new class was teased, but we don’t yet know what that will look like.</p>



<p>In the subsequent information divulged from Lord of Hatred, it was confirmed that massive gameplay updates are incoming, including an overhaul to endgame systems, a level cap increase, and the return of the Horadric Cube.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer for Lord of Hatred:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It was later reported that the new expansion, Lord of Hatred, will introduce <strong>fishing</strong> as a side activity. It’s not clear why you’d want to consume the fish found across the Diablo universe, but perhaps they serve another purpose.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals already has a roster that can rival any hero game in existence. So, it makes sense to throw in the foul-mouthed and hilarious Deadpool for good measure in 2026.</p>



<p>Deadpool might be one of the most popular Marvel heroes ever. Let’s be clear, this was BEFORE Ryan Reynolds elevated the character to new, bloody heights. At The Game Awards 2025, Deadpool made his mark and will make his mark in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-confirmed-to-feature-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adding-deadpool-in-2026">Marvel Rivals Adding Deadpool In 2026</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 6: Night at the Museum starts on January 16, and Deadpool will be a headline attraction.</p>







<p>The wonderful Wade Wilson arrives in the legendary Deadpool get-up, and it’s going to be fascinating how much NetEase can keep a lid on the silly, sarcastic, and sharp (in more ways than one) assassin.</p>

Kennedy is in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and he's here to kick butt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight, at The Game Awards 2025, a fresh trailer for Resident Evil Requiem saw Leon fully revealed, swinging into action as the now-grizzled veteran zombie fighter we all know and love. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned what many of us had expected, that Leon will feature as one of two playable characters, alongside the previously announced Grace Ashcroft. While Grace's campaign focuses on survival horror, Leon's separate antics will focus on action. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/resident-evil-requiem-world-premiere-trailer-from-the-game-awards-2025-00-02-46-1765504545021.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, the reveal of new Resident Evil: Requiem cover art featuring Leon finally put to bed one of this year's biggest gaming mysteries — something developer Capcom has itself refused to address — just days ahead of Requiem's appearance tonight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors have persisted for months over Leon's involvement in Resident Evil: Requiem, with Capcom <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">specifically declining to answer IGN's questions over the character</a> back at Gamescom in August. The game's developers have even suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon would be a poor fit as a protagonist for the game's quieter sections</a> as he is now too grizzled to be scared. But through all of this, Capcom left itself with just enough wiggle room for Leon to still be lurking somewhere — presumably during Requiem's more action-packed sequences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's involvement now being confirmed, Requiem may still have secrets left in store.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/exodus-resurfaces-with-indiana-jones-meets-interstellar-type-adventure-vibe-in-new-trailer-the-game-awards-2025</link>
            <guid>1380946</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after two years since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023, Archetype Entertainment's sci-fi action-RPG Exodus is still something of a mystery. Set in an original sci-fi universe from Wizards of the Coast – of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fame – Exodus focuses on the accelerated evolution of human and alien civilizations, with players deciding the fate of different factions and humanity within the warring galaxy. Also, Matthew McConaughey will play a pivotal character who will guide players on that journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the reveal of the newest trailer at The Game Awards 2025, we got an early look and learned from the devs how the time dilation system will influence the player's story, in what they refer to as an adventure that feels like "Indiana Jones meets Interstellar." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We try to give players a lot of agency in everything they do. Our goal is to almost make them feel like co-authors in the story, and not just along for the ride," said Chris King, game director on Exodus. "When it comes to Jun's story, you basically make a ton of moral choices, and then you see them play out across multiple generations due to time dilation." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With sci-fi author Peter F. Hamilton working with Wizards of the Coast to build the history and lore of Exodus, along with developer Archetype Entertainment having many former-Bioware devs on board, it's certainly tapping into the same tone and scale of the much-loved Mass Effect series. But in Exodus, the developers aim to present player consequences in a different way, with time as a constant force. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the Centauri Cluster in the far future, Exodus follows humanity as it struggles to survive in its new home, Lidon, after the collapse of Earth. With their new home world also collapsing, lone human scavenger Jun discovers they have the ability to control mysterious artifacts from a powerful alien force known as Celestials, which allows him to help give humanity a chance at survival. But over the course of their journey, Jun will first see the results of their choices, shaped by interstellar time dilation, forcing them to directly confront the positive and negative consequences in the ever-changing galaxy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer offers a clearer glimpse of the stakes driving Exodus' main story, which sees protagonist Jun explore the galaxy with their allies and encounter factions shaped by their choices – including some human factions that have evolved into alien-like races over generations. Much like the Mass Effect series from BioWare, Exodus leans into player choice, and this also includes options for players to customize Jun's appearance and gender to fit their type of story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the developer interviews, the creative team explained that, in addition to narrative choices, the core combat and traversal will also offer options, such as going all out with Jun's arsenal of weapons and celestial powers, or using more stealthy tactics to overcome rival factions and complete complex tasks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Drew Karpyshyn, narrative director on Exodus and former BioWare writer on both the Mass Effect series and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, the main story will show Jun's growth as an interstellar explorer and wielder of ancient alien technology tied to his lineage as a "Traveler." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You begin the game as a lonely scavenger, but [Jun] has a connection to a powerful 'traveler' dynasty, and they also have access to some powerful alien tech, which only they can use," said Karpyshyn. "Over the course of the game, Jun reclaims their traveler heritage and becomes a champion, leader, and hero of the people, and ultimately, Jun is the only character able to stop the destruction of the human homeworld. I think people are really going to see the story of Jun when they get a chance to play it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exodus will also feature a variety of companion characters that can help in battle and help flesh out the story, and can even form some romances with. One particularly interesting companion from the trailer is an alien octopus who rides in a mech suit. Though this particular character is not romanceable, other allies will have opportunities to form deeper bonds in the story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But one key character that is still something of an enigma is the ally played by Matthew McConaughey. Known as C.C. Orlev, he was once a legendary human explorer who went missing. Jun will eventually interact with Orlev, but only when they're needed the most. The trailer showed off a bit more of McConaughey's role in the game, and while it is a familiar wise elder type of archetype, it is still intriguing to see the actor make his video game debut with such an ambitious role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
