			<p>It comes as no surprise these days that a game has leaked just weeks before its release, and this time, it's happened to Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. This title is set for release on September 26, and allegedly copies of the game have already leaked online. Just on Friday, the game showed up for the first time on the internet, so now Nintendo has to try and get rid of any footage or gameplay, as it is illegal to have the game via emulation already. The ROM for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has been confirmed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> in a YouTube video, but he has stated that he will not share it as it is "illegal and career-ending to do so."</p>
<p><iframe title="Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Has Fully Leaked Online!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaoF0C0YsC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't Nintendo's first rodeo, as 2023 was full of leaks for Nintendo. Content from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom surfaced online, as well as content from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Additionally, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully leaked online two weeks before its official release date. Metroid Dread, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl were also caught in the crossfire of being leaked on the internet before their release dates.</p>
<p>With Nintendo's strict rules about piracy, emulation, and game conservation, this is not surprising. ROMs of their most famous games from the 90s have been removed from the internet for years, including those who try to make fan games or mods. In addition, Nintendo has recently been giving out orders to retailers to cancel people's pre-orders of their first-party games. This was recently seen with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.</p>
<p>Nintendo never gave a reason for why they were doing that, but people assumed that it was so that the employees couldn't get hold of the game early, create a ROM, and pirate the game. It makes sense that Nintendo would make this decision when, just last year, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gamestop-employee-who-shared-tears-of-the-kingdom-leak-says-he-was-fired-at-nintendos-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop fired an employee</a> for doing that with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Compared to other current-gen consoles, the Nintendo Switch is incredibly easy to emulate and get running on a PC, just as previous Nintendo consoles have been. This is in contrast to consoles like the PlayStation 3, which is notoriously difficult to get running smoothly on a PC, no matter how powerful the rig is.</p>
<p>It now means that those who have legally bought The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have to try to dodge all sorts of spoilers on the internet until September 26. That is much easier said than done, as spoilers have a way of popping up everywhere.</p>

            <p>To survive in looter-booter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> you have to keep the paranormal station wagon you drive around in good nick. You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">review</a> praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.</p>
<p>Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.</p>

<p>Most of the changes are mentioned in the trailer above, and detailed in full in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">an update post on Steam</a>. But to give you a summary, there are now a bunch of fresh difficulty presets. "Scenic Drive" lowers crafting requirements and makes it impossible to die, for example. While "Joyride" keeps the mortal threat but minimises hazards and says that "gathering, crafting, and research requirements are all lowered." 

</p><p>If you are currently screaming "NO, THE BANJAXED CAR IS THE WHOLE POINT." Then, firstly, wow, relax. Secondly, this update also offers some very challenging presets as a contrast. "Olympic Gauntlet" ups the difficulty of everything - hazards, crafting, car damage, you name it. "Iron Wagon" makes everything similarly tough but also notes that "failing a run will delete your save file." </p><p> There is also the "Mechanic's Road Trip" option, which states: "Terrain and the status of the car impact driving more. Items to repair the car are more costly to craft, and can't be crafted on a run." Which sounds like somebody took an important-looking cylinder out of the roguelike's bonnet and installed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> straight into the engine block. </p>
<p>You can also go crazy on a bunch of difficulty sliders, say the devs, and create your own custom mode. Your flat tires can now be flatter, for example, and the radiation more radioactive. You could turn off the "instability storms" that threaten you during a run. Or you could make your engine go more vroom-vroom. There's also that fatal car boot I mentioned at the start of the article - an option titled: "Trunk Bonk kills". Don't laugh! Car boots are dangerous. My friend concussed a girl while on a date by absent-mindedly slamming the boot down while she was still looking for something. They got married and had babies. It is possible the concussion is to blame.</p>
<p>There are other changes in the update. You can now have your own music play through the car radio, and your garage's jukebox, by loading the files directly into a local folder in the game directory. That's cool. An undersung strength of the road-tripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> was its soundtrack, which had some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3MACUEAimI&amp;list=PLnF67y5vNQETIXmLg3Kes717M9vfDhqtV">pretty good tunes</a> (my favourite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61UPO8npOHc">Bloodoath by Exes &amp; Petey</a>).</p>
<p>I quite liked the pace of crafting when I toyed with Pacific Drive, but it's true it slowed me down enough to lose momentum and not finish the game. Difficulty is tough to measure, and often one of the best things you can do is just hand the nitty-gritty of that decision straight to the players. So fair play. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Paul Dean, a former contributor to RPS and my former fellow-in-board-games, did some writing for Pacific Drive. This explains why it's so weird.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the issues at play was apparently the profit margin that Intel wanted on each unit sold. Another thing that seemingly helped put AMD over the top was the fact that sticking with the chip maker would help limit potential issues around backwards compatibility for the next-gen console. </p><p>AMD designed the CPU and GPU for both the PS4 and PS5. In addition to the existing relationship, the continuation in manufacturing processes was likely part of why the transition between the two console generations was so smooth, with PS5 owners gaining access to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry">thousands of games from the older console</a></span> as soon as it launched. A similar transition for the PS6 would ensure three generations of of games, and players’ libraries, potentially all available on one device. </p><p>That’s in stark contrast to the PS3, whose unique Nvidia-based “cell” processor created all sorts of problems for developers porting games to the console and for Sony trying to get PS3 games playable on PS4. Without compatible hardware, software solutions are required, which can be costly and require huge investments from the console maker. Instead, Sony has so far opted to simply make PS3 games available on the PS5 solely through cloud gaming on the most expensive “Premium” tier of PS Plus. </p><p>The PS4 console cycle lasted seven years, and the PS5 one could go on even longer.

The PS5 Pro, coming in November for $700, could end up being the halfway point between the current generation and the release of a PS6.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When is the PS6 coming out? <span>This question is</span> beginning to be asked following the announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>,&nbsp;and in this article, we’ll try to break it down.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t currently a direct answer as to when the PS6 release date will be confirmed, but court documents suggest that PlayStation has a year in mind. Dating back to court documents relating to the CMA’s investigation of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, count documents revealed that both Microsoft and Sony are not expecting to release their next-generation consoles until 2028.</p>



<p>“Indeed, the next new generation of consoles is not expected to be released before the fall of 2028 at the very earliest”, the documents read. While the court documents are from late 2022, and things can change, it does suggest that the PS6 will be released around 2028.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, we have various documents and first-hand accounts that imply that PlayStation has been back and forth on the date, but for the sake of argument, we’d like to think that PlayStation aims to release the PS6 in 2028.</p>



<p>Of course, things can change, but publicly and privately, that seems to be the direction the company is heading.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report from&nbsp;Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>As for the next generation Xbox consoles, there are rumors within the community that suggest that Xbox might try to get ahead of the competition this generation and release their next generation console sooner. This could indicate that the next-generation Xbox could be released in 2026-2027, but we have no sources to corroborate the rumors.</p>



<p>When do you think the PS6 is coming out? Let us know in the comments below or in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong is easily the biggest success registered by a Chinese developer so far with a premium game. Earlier this month, we learned that the action RPG had sold 18 million units; however, Daniel Camilo, an industry analyst based in China, <a href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835068254416781433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that Game Science's debut title is now around the 20 million units milestone. In the same tweet, Camilo also revealed to have heard from certain sources that the first Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be released in early 2025, around the new Chinese Year festivity, so between the end of January and early February.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, Game Science is preparing at least two DLCs before moving on with the inevitable sequel. Of course, the studio is still working on the delayed Xbox Series S|X port, too, with Microsoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying</a> that the delay had anything to do with its consoles' limitations.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Black Myth: Wukong earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who summarized his experience with the game as follows:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

            <p>If you're a fan of rhythm games and fun bops, then you might want to bookmark ol' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyperbeat">Hyperbeat</a>. Set in a wireframe world, you're to chop, dodge or ride notes as you slam your "hyperknight" through a tunnel at high speed. There's a subtle, dreamy story element to your musical journey, with confusing dialogue and a nice cherry blossom tree. Hmmm, curious. Anyway yeah, it looks rad.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm sure rhythm game fanatics will say Hyperbeat looks like many other rhythm games. For me, it's a bit of a mash-up between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez</a>, in which you you float through a stylised, polygonal world, and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">Osu!</a>, in which you click or hold or follow circular beats as they pop-up on screen. In Hyperbeat you do a bit of both, determined by the colour and shape of the beat you're about to collide with. It looks like it's all about steering your knight gracefully into beats and making the right decisions so the jungle or electronic tunes flow smoothly.</p>

<p>There isn't much else to go on right now, sadly. All the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam page</a> says is that it's home to an original soundtrack with a "progression system", whatever that means. Workshop support is a fantastic touch - these sorts of games thrive off people's creations. Oh and difficulty and accessibility options mean it won't be impenetrable, hopefully.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by the one snippet of story we do see, which is a sad looking tree telling us not to forget to rest. Cheers pal.</p>
<p>There's no release date on this one, but it's due out sometime this year. You can follow it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam</a> if you'd like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I disagree to some extent. Ubisoft may not always strike gold, but they understand how to make an entertaining popcorn game that leaves you wanting more. Although that <em>more </em>often comes include elements that are reminiscent of other games.</p><p>Here, in recommending games to follow your <em>Outlaws</em> experience with, we’ll focus on similar open-world adventures with freewheeling decision-making that provide players with senses of wonder and unparalleled potential. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While it doesn’t match the overall scope of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> does similarly place you in the shoes of a strong, capable woman hellbent on making her way in life. As Lara Croft, you will utilize stealth, cunning, and trickery to ambush enemies in the jungle, craft tools and equipment, upgrade your gear, and venture deep into a mysterious story that takes you to equally mysterious locales.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD PROJEKT RED</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you missed out on <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> due to its abysmal launch, you owe it to yourself to give CD Projekt RED’s magnum opus a second glance. It’s a highly stable, exceptionally well-written, and downright entertaining open-world action RPG with much to offer. You can lose yourself in Night City, immersing yourself as V in the seedy underbelly of a city gone haywire. The possibilities for how you approach missions and build your character alone will push you to return for multiple playthroughs.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guerrilla / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> continues Aloy’s story as she sets out on an all-new adventure toward the West Coast of the former United States of America. Along the way, she’ll encounter unique tribes, new machines, and plenty of gameplay mechanics that remind us of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. This, of course, includes stealth takedowns, but wrapped in a more cohesive and polished package. Aloy is a compelling character with likes, dislikes, goals, and adversaries that affect how the story plays out before our very eyes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bend Studio / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Days Gone</em> has been in the headlines lately for all the wrong reasons, but it’s still an exceptional open-world game that flew under the radar after its rough launch. The story of Deek, roaming the post-apocalyptic landscape of Oregon as a drifter and bounty hunter, creates a compelling narrative that most find difficult to put down. If you don’t mind investing upwards of 70 hours in a single playthrough, <em>Days Gone</em> stands a cut above the rest as an immersive and heart-wrenching story of survival.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do we even need to tout the overall impressive nature of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>? It’s arguably one of the finest video game tales written and produced, with the most compelling, authentic characters to date. And that’s not to mention the immersive, expansive, and realistic game world you can spend hundreds of hours exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang goes down in the history books, and if you enjoy open-world titles whatsoever, you owe it to yourself to play this one straight through!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To this point, we’ve highlighted numerous open-world games that attempt to provide players with untold freedom. <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>, while large in scope, provides a more streamlined, story-based experience for those who want a better look at the cutthroat lives and world of fortune hunters. Kay Vess loves her credits, and Nathan Drake loves priceless antiquities lost to time.

If that sounds like you, it’ll be easy to lose yourself in the Settled Systems for potentially hundreds of hours.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, San Francisco 49ers running back--and last year's Offensive Player of the Year--Christian McCaffrey was named the cover athlete for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>. But unfortunately, McCaffrey has been placed on injured reserve with calf soreness and Achilles tendinitis. As part of the IR designation, McCaffrey will miss at least the first four games of the season.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41258841/sources-49ers-christian-mccaffrey-ir-next-4-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESPN</a>, McCaffrey had a history of injuries when he was a member of the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 2021. For those two seasons, McCaffrey played in 10 games total. Since arriving in San Francisco, McCaffrey has played in 32 out of the 49ers' 33 games. But given McCaffrey's recent appearance on Madden NFL 25's cover, his injury has reinvigorated talk about the so-called Madden curse.</p><p>The late John Madden was primarily featured on the cover of the video games that shared his name prior to 1998. Once NFL players were featured on the cover, it gave rise to theory that there was some sort of Madden curse that would doom the cover athletes to either an injury or a subpar season. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS Sports</a> recently ran an analysis of the Madden curse by looking back at what happened to the last 24 athletes who appeared on the cover. 14 players either suffered an injury or had diminished playing skills afterwards.</p><p>Of course, the most likely explanation for the Madden curse is that football is a brutally physical game that wears down even the strongest bodies. Only a handful of players make it though their careers without missing games to injuries. But that probably won't stop the Madden curse conspiracy theorists from pointing to McCaffrey as the latest victim.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psychotherapy-sim-vampire-therapist-to-get-three-major-free-updates.981972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-free-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Little Bat Games has revealed that three major free&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>updates are on the way, bringing new scenarios for you to discover.</p>
<p>The first of those updates, "The Blood of Troy", is available today, and it begins a three-part story in which you'll be administering (vampire) therapy to your 3000-year-old mentor. As you can imagine, a vampire that old will have some baggage he's carrying around.</p>
<p>Two more updates will then arrive prior to the end of 2024. "Spanish Nights" will explore pre-Renaissance Spain, while "Fathoms Below" will focus on "the birth of psychoanalysis", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=RGoDveS- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=KOQQvX20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is getting some updates for you to, uh, sink your teeth into.</figcaption></figure><p>Creative director Cyrus Nemati says that&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>"has touched players in ways we could not have anticipated", and that the updates should serve as a "nice treat to invite players back into our world to learn more about our oldest vampire".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, well, the clue's in the name; you are Sam, a former gunslinger who decides to become a therapist for his fellow bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>Sam's clients include "self-hating vampires, agoraphobic social media addicts, supernatural narcissists, and victims of centuries-old capitalistic systems", so as you can probably imagine, this is a game with a lot to say about the real world, vampires or no.</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>looks like a visual novel, it is, in fact, a "fully-voiced interactive play", and you'll have plenty of options when it comes to interacting with your clients and deciding what to say to them.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>has a pretty star-studded cast as well as a fascinating premise. It boasts the voice talent of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2"><em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star Matt Mercer and&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s Sarah Grayson</a>, among others.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>.

While unexplained, this was presumably an effort to plug the leaks where physical copies of a game are sent to stores days or weeks in advance of street date, so that shelves can be stocked for midnight, and orders sent out to customers can arrive at their homes day one. But obviously this also creates an opportunity for staff to get hold of a copy, create a ROM, and pirate the game. Last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759">GameStop fired an employee for doing exactly that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866">New <em>Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom</em> Trailer Reveals It Has A Whole Second World</a></span></p><p>This is a problem that’s exacerbated by another aspect unique to the Switch: it’s a current-gen console that’s easily emulated on PC. Emulators are usually about two console generations behind, and there’s currently little sign of stable, working PS4 or Xbox One emus, and 360 emulation isn’t going <em>great</em>. But the Switch was relatively old tech even on its 2017 release, which meant emulators appeared almost straight away, and seven years later they’re now capable of running Switch games at far higher resolutions and framerates than the Nintendo console itself. This means leaked ROMs aren’t the purvey of piracy carts as was the case with the Nintendo DS, but instead are easily captured PC games, making it ludicrously simple to upload footage online.</p><p>Thus, Nintendo is now issuing a flurry of takedown notifications on videos that are appearing on YouTube, showing the first Zelda-led <em>Zelda </em>game being played ten days ahead of the game going on sale.</p><p>The severity of such a situation is often in the eye of the beholder. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463">Nintendo claims that <em>TotK</em> was pirated one million times</a></span> in court cases related to the matter.

<p>The next-generation PlayStation 6 (PS6) is already well in development, and major decisions on the console have already been made.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>The report claims that one of the disputes between Intel and Sony involved how much profit Intel would make from each processor. On top of the price dispute, backwards compatibility is said to be a major sticking point with Sony. </p>



<p>“Moving from AMD, which made the PlayStation 5 chip, to Intel would have risked backwards compatibility, which was a subject of discussion between Intel and Sony engineers and executives,” the report states. “Ensuring backward compatibility with prior versions of the PlayStation would have been costly and taken engineering resources.”</p>



<p>Whether that means backwards compatibility with just PS5 and PS4 games or that means further back in the PlayStation catalog is currently unknown.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sony staying with AMD for the PS6 processor?

The modding tool was only unlocked a week ago on September 9 so this is still a very early version of what's possible, but it's a sign of bigger and better things to come when modders inevitably spend months and years creating custom content.</p><p>A YouTube video of the <a href="https://youtu.be/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">castle</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/wKBkko6KJhA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avernus map</a> were shared too, showing Baldur's Gate 3 characters Wyll and Astarion walking around in them as normally as they would the official game. Screenshots in the Reddit posts show the maps too, and while both are still quite basic, katszenBurger has plans to expand their creations.</p><p>"I had a lava area planned too, and maybe I could make the lake explorable a bit," they said on the Avernus map. "Dialogue is a work in progress in the editor, as are some of the environmental elements." But characters can walk around, pick up items, fight enemies, and so on. katszenBurger also said map making is "very simple," meaning others will have easy access to create maps of their own.</p><p>While console players can enjoy the wealth of mods being made purely through the official Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit, maps like these will remain out of reach unless Larian decides to fully unlock it itself. CEO Swen Vincke said in March this won't be happening, but perhaps plans will change after players managed it themselves.</p><p>The toolkit arrived alongside Patch 7, which added lots of other content including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>. Players will also be relieved to hear that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-not-the-final-update-larian-confirms-but-it-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-whats-coming-just-yet">it's not the final Baldur's Gate 3 patch after all</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of the game</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

What inspired this idea for a photography game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Notar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When I first started </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I was working on a AAA project that was going through a variety of ups and downs. There were too many meetings, which prevented progress. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> became a creative outlet for me on the weekends. I started writing a game design document that had info about level designs, the creatures that inhabited them, the overall aesthetic, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's focus on photography was the result of ideas I had about the setting. I wanted to explore dreams and the subconscious and thought that photography could work well with this. I was intrigued by the potential of a game that lets players explore their subconscious and then uses photography to bring those hidden elements into their conscious mind. It seemed novel, and not to mention, I was a huge </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan growing up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lore foundation was inspiring, and even though it's buried really deep in the final game, you'll find it woven throughout various dialogues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early game design document, the levels were much wilder. I had a jazz emporium level where all of the creatures played instruments, a junkyard level where all of humanity's lost ideas were thrown into, etc. The levels were wacky and Fictional, so I called their inhabitants Fictions. The scope for the levels was too high, but the Fictions and overall vision remained.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about the process of designing a Fiction? How did you pick concepts to make into creatures, and how did you take those concepts and give them physical animal shapes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Skylar Surra was helping out with concept art. I'd give both him and Daniel Kraft the Fiction design, their quests, what the Fictions were going to do, the landscape they would be in, etc. They would then handle the details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Daniel Kraft took over the concept as well and started making pieces of the Fictions modular, copying elements between them. This sped up our process greatly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's playful art style? Why choose this visual style for your unique creatures and world?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Limitations! Many of our art assets are from a variety of online asset stores. We didn't have a dedicated artist, so the levels fell on me to "art" up. I relied on lighting for cohesion, which I learned by watching a lot of Udemy tutorials.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other benefit of our visual style is performance. By keeping the poly count low, we could focus more on making the game fun and less on constantly optimizing it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fictions do a variety of poses so long as the player solves puzzles in the environment. What thoughts went into creating the various actions and poses some of the creatures do?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried to bring their personalities out on the map with their poses, interactions, sounds, etc. The Fictions don't care about the puzzles themselves; they just care about the outcome. For example, Mudwog doesn't care that we moved the lanterns closer to him to attract the bugs. He just wants the bugs. If you give Mudwog bugs, then it's a great opportunity for more poses to take pictures of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interacting with Fictions on Dream's Doorstep is our biggest differentiator since it allows you to speak with them and understand their quirks and habits. For example, Mudwog has no ego, but Wullard does! If you throw a donut at Mudwog, he doesn't care, but throwing a donut at Wullard will make him mad enough to smash into a rock, open a new path, and get a new pose for you to take a picture of.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what thoughts went into the environmental puzzles players could solve? How did you shape puzzles so they fit into the natural environments of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Jay Watford and I figured out tools that would give us a variety of mechanics to play with. Jason Burton then helped to make these mechanics look and feel good from an art and VFX perspective. From there, I'd mark out puzzle areas on the levels and revisit them throughout development, adding more where applicable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the time, it would be looking at the environment feature and thinking, "Hmm... I bet we could add a magnet puzzle here" or something along those lines. I'd then work it into the level to fit it in the best I could. For example, adding more rocks around if it was a magnet, trying to find dark places for the lanterns, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Friendship is an important element alongside photography in this game. What appealed to you about letting players befriend the Fictions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's just more fun to talk with characters than insentient creatures. It gives us more to work with in terms of minigames, quests, and IP. If the Fictions were similar to wild animals and didn't appreciate the things you did for them, it wouldn't be as satisfying. Imagine if all of the Fiction dialogue was "roar" or "grrr." This might be funny for a second, but it gets old quickly. When you get to know the oddities of Fictions, their wants, their history, etc., helping them becomes a much greater reward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the minigames you play to become friends with the Fictions? What do you feel the minigames, as well as friendships, added to this photo-taking experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was all Max Shawabkeh. When Max joined, it unlocked a whole world of possibility for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He's a truly exceptional engineer and can really do it all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Max suggested we could have minigames on Dream's Doorstep instead of simply talking to them, I lit up. It was a great way to add depth to the game, giving players many more ways to engage with Fictions and get to know them in a way that simple text never could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think that the minigames are one of the most quintessential pieces of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Without them, we wouldn't have Jo'keel's Comedy Club or Justaplant's Court Case. These quests, while optional, show Fictions in a special light and imprint lasting memories. It makes you want to go back into the level and get the best picture you can of that Fiction.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> grades players based on their picture. How did you choose the criteria by which to grade the picture? What sort of work went into programming the game to be able to score the players on how well they did?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our goals for this were:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy to understand and objective.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not trivial, so we could make some Fictions and poses more challenging to photograph than others.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not so specific that the players couldn't express their creativity.</span><br></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Max, the coding itself was straightforward. It was designing the criteria and tweaking the difficulty that took time. We referenced all other photography games out there but landed on our ranking system since it made the most sense for the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players can freely roam the game or explore it on-rails. What drew you to have these two systems? What challenges or benefits did you face in letting players be able to do both?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were playtesting early on, we felt that the game needed more than just an on-rails experience. Exploring on foot gave it a totally different feel. Players could take their time, set up the perfect shot, interact with more of the level, etc. The gameplay possibilities opened up. What's also nice is that the on-rails gameplay tours you around the level and familiarizes you with it before you unlock free roam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, free roam did take a lot of work. I had to add many more meshes to prevent the player from escaping the level, make sure that the surfaces all felt good to traverse upon, add more exclusive things that you could only do while free-roaming, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also had different rules for on-rails vs free roam, such as what happens when you jump on a Fiction while in free roam, what happens when you pass through one while on rails, etc. The work was worth it, though.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players have some ability to get creative with edits and certain toys. How did you decide on the tools players would have to jazz up their photos? How did you implement abilities that would make the pictures more interesting or fun?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creativity is a pillar for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and we constantly tried to work it into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had a lot of Google sheets with our ideas for minigames, quest rewards, etc. Most of the time, we came up with the idea, wrote it on the spreadsheet, and then iterated on it from there. If it seemed like something that would allow expression and be fun to interact with, we then assigned it as a reward to one of the Fictions based on their personality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying elements is seeing how other players use these tools. We have a small Discord where people have posted their favorite photos, their Dream's Doorstep decorations, etc. Everyone adds a different twist to it, and many have been inspired by the game. We've had a person cry during the ending of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while streaming, a person who created an entire wiki for the game by himself, and even a person who is now incorporating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Fictions into his own indie game titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abomi Nation: Monster Rifts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, our goal was to empower players with creative tools that not only enhance their in-game experience but also inspire them to express themselves and connect with others in ways that extend far beyond the game itself.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Gaming history makes for a fascinating subject to read about, and if you're looking to dive deep into the hidden stories behind Nintendo's NES and Game Boy systems, you'll want to check out these two books. Written by well-known gaming historian Florent George, these are the long-awaited translations of the third and fourth volumes in The History of Nintendo series and are now available through Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History Of the Famicom/NES</a> is available for $28 and you can pair that with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8N8QJ3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History Of The Game Boy</a> at the same price.</p><p>So what makes these books so different? Gorge's unofficial history books go deep into the business of Nintendo, covering the company's origins when it started selling playing cards and eventually rose to prominence as a video game giant. Instead of relying on widely available facts, Gorge unearthed surprising secrets and revelations to explore the secret history of Nintendo.</p><div title="6526492 - History of NES and Game Boy" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2665" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526492 - History of NES and Game Boy" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The History Of the Famicom/NES</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$28</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This newly translated volume chronicles the rise of Nintendo from 1983-2016, focusing on the Family Computer (Famicom) that would come to be known as the Nintendo Entertainment System in the rest of the world.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-to-be-powered-by-amd-as-intel-lost-bid-to-design-the-console-in-2022.981921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like its two predecessors, the PlayStation 6 console will be powered by an AMD chip, but that apparently wasn't a guarantee until 2022, when Intel lost the bid to design Sony's new system.</p>
<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, Intel and AMD were the two final contenders in the bidding process for the contract. Reportedly, a dispute over how much profit would Intel make from each chip sold to Sony blocked Intel from settling on the price. AMD, on the other hand, got the contract through a competitive bidding process that eliminated other contenders until only Intel was left. Discussions between Intel and Sony went on for a few months in 2022 and involved meetings between the two companies' CEOs, engineers, and executives.</p>
<p>Intel provided a comment to Reuters regarding the failed PlayStation 6 bid, saying that they "<em>strongly disagree with this characterization but are not going to comment about any current or potential customer conversations</em>." AMD declined to comment.</p>
<p>While being unable to settle on a price played some role in the decision, compatibility concerns were also taken into consideration, as going from AMD to Intel for the PlayStation 6 would have put backward compatibility in jeopardy. This was a matter of discussion between engineers and executives from both companies.</p>
<p>As the PlayStation 6 is still years away from release, it is not surprising that we know very little about the system as of now. Earlier this year, we learned that Sony aims to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful next-generation system</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> will play a big role in delivering what manufacturers are teasing as the biggest generational leap ever.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splatoon-3-updates-coming-to-an-end-seasonal-events-to-continue.981915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that regular&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are coming to a close, but if you're a regular player, don't worry; this isn't quite the end for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1835506615971356881" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nintendo says that while regular updates are ending, seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-splatoween">Splatoween</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-spring-fest">Spring Fest</a>, and Summer Nights will continue "with some returning themes", so you'll still have plenty to do in&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, regular balance updates adjusting weapons "will be released as needed", and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges will all "continue for the time being", Nintendo says. Of course, that wording also implies that these events could end at any time, so stay sharp.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=08CI08x6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=fGlCe38J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are ending, but the game's not going anywhere.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, this also means the servers won't be shut down anytime soon, so you'll still be able to head into&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>and find a game; you just won't be getting any more major content drops.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates ending at this point makes sense; Nintendo supported&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>for around two years, with the game's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-releases-splatoon-2s-final-significant-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">final major update landing in July 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not this signals that Nintendo is gearing up to make&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, of course.&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>was originally announced in early 2021 as part of a Nintendo Direct, which would mean it was revealed about a year and a half after&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>updates ended.</p>
<p>If this timeline is indicative of Nintendo's current plans, we can probably expect a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement sometime in early 2026, and that means it'll probably be arriving on whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">the Switch's successor</a> turns out to be called.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=wXE7W50V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=t5O7o4-2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we be getting a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement in 2026?</figcaption></figure><p>That's all speculation, though, and right now,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is still very much a going concern. Updates might have ended, but the servers aren't going anywhere, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>action, your best bet is still&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>You can pick the game up <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.</p>
<p>It's "a compact and high-density <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alruna is a dryad in a dying world - a spirit of life in the land of the dead. The earth is sucked dry. There is only The Sprawl. Poor, bedraggled skele-men dot the Wasteland of the Necro-Industrialists and shuffle endlessly back and forth in a toiling mockery of life. But are they the real enemy? Or do the skeletons suffer just as much as the dryads under the domination of the Necro-Industrialists? </p>
<p>And salvation? Is it possible? Dead men yearn for Heaven. But the dead can only dig... </p></blockquote>

You get a chargeable jump, a dash move and a slide by default, plus a choice of weapons and items plucked from the crevices of a world that includes four temples (plus a possible fifth "secret" temple, which isn't that secret given that they've mentioned it on the Steam page).</p>
<p>The music is pretty stylish, and there are familiar puzzle setups such as flipping switches to make certain platforms dematerialise while others grow solid. Power-ups include exploding mushrooms, magic vines and electro-plants. It's packing in a fair bit, though the square aspect room-based format makes everything feel quite tidy.</p>
<p>Aside from platform-puzzle gambits, we can expect hidden minigames, "a star-crossed enemies-to-lovers romance with a rival adventurer" and several story endings. It's got a pretty unvarnished anti-capitalist thing going on, without (so far) being didactic. One friendly character you meet complains about "endless progress and infinite growth". There is definitely scope for more Wasteland quotation here but hopefully, they'll restrain themselves.</p>
<p>The full game is out on 26th September. Developers Neckbolt are also working on pocket-sized trick-or-treat platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165420/October_Panic/">October Panic</a>. Their past releases include <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/602430/Yono_and_the_Celestial_Elephants/">Yono And The Celestial Elephants</a>, which Alec (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-new-steam-games-oct">deemed</a> an "almost absurdly wholesome Zeldalike", corpse girl adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/351340/Belladonna/">Belladona</a>, which seems a little less wholesome, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407400/Molly_Medusa_Queen_of_Spit/">Molly Medusa: Queen Of Spit</a>, in which you can walk on walls and turn things to stone. A studio to keep an eye on, probably.</p>

Through the simple act of taking a photo, photography games and photo modes implore us to notice our surroundings, document our experience, and take a moment to commit to memory the images and emotions that we felt along the way. As Game Developer launches its Photography Week, come along with us as we take a quick look at the history of photography in video games and its popular uses within the genre and preview the new interviews, essays, and deep dives publishing in the days to come. &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In video games there are two primary ways we experience photography. There are games in which photography is the primary gameplay element, used to structure a narrative or add puzzle-based progression. And there are games that have photo modes, giving players tools to make and edit the perfect photo within the world they’re immersed in. Over the years, as graphical fidelity has evolved, so too has the demand for in-game photography; it seems like almost every open-world game has a photo mode these days. But players embraced the mechanic long before graphics had the ability to make their photos actually look good, going back at least as far as the N64 era. Look no further than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/building-a-compelling-photography-mechanic-mexico-1921" target="_self">Photography as narrative design in <em>Mexico, 1921: A deep slumber</em></a></p><p>Pokémon Snap as it appears on the Wii virtual console.

The resulting photos weren’t particularly pretty or artistic (and famously failed to adhere to basic photographic principles), but the game was smart in that it addressed an early issue in photography games by controlling the player’s movements and line of sight, avoiding the staggering technical costs of facilitating spontaneous Pokémon interactions in an open world. It would be many years before the game would see its sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but in the meantime, it would inspire many games, establishing a format that would be seen in so many later titles both directly and indirectly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts of Maravilla Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (all of which we’ll discuss later this week) would make their own spin on photographing a collection of creatures, sometimes adding an element of puzzle-solving to encourage new poses or scenes to add experiential variety. And many games with photo modes, from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the building game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, use a compendium to help the player keep track of the plants, animals and other items they’ve snapped in the game, sometimes to convey information about their environment or how they can be used in crafting or cooking.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/interior-worlds-q-a" target="_self">Building a sense of atmospheric dread with the liminal spaces of <em>Interior Worlds</em></a></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other notable and influential games in the genre focus on the recurring themes of documentation, not just of biological species, but in terms of photojournalism, from the heroine Jade in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to the antihero Frank West in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to journalist Eric in safari photo game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Afrika</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

And there’s the more voyeuristic and modern take on documentation in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Crush House</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which positions players as the videographers on a reality show. You can read a deep dive into that and how the devs approached the subjectivity of a film clip rating system later this week.</span></p><p>Screenshots from the original Fatal Frame on PlayStation 2. Images via Tecmo.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of games that center photography in their gameplay, historically there is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fatal Frame</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which famously used the camera to detect and photograph ghosts, a theme of revealing hidden truth that continues in horror to this day. For example, in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the camera is used to emphasize the journalist Miles Upshur’s vulnerability as he documents the horrors inside a psychiatric asylum. In many minigames and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/q-a-designing-the-photogenic-vignettes-and-camera-play-in-snap-happy-adventure-i-toem-i-"> lighter contemporary titles like </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/q-a-designing-the-photogenic-vignettes-and-camera-play-in-snap-happy-adventure-i-toem-i-">TOEM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the camera is a puzzle-solving tool, used to find and photograph items at the behest of secondary characters or reveal obscured information. And building on the direct link between photography and gameplay are games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Camera Obscura</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a platformer where players solve puzzles by assembling environmental elements from still photographs, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Viewfinder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which similarly “reshapes reality” by manipulating photographed objects.</span></p><p>Image via Thunderful Publishing.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Point and shooting the virtual world">Point and shooting the virtual world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As far as photo modes go, these days, they’re so ubiquitous as to be an expected game feature; more recently, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/black-salt-games-wants-to-buck-the-trend-with-dredge-photo-mode">Dredge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have added photo modes in post-release updates, and open-world titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> use them to add value to the expanse of their environments or to help players tell stories through their characters. And it’s not just in 3D games—take, for example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whose depiction of the Scottish highlands and its accompanying photo mode are entirely in 2D (stay tuned for a discussion on that tomorrow).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also fascinating to note the role that early PC games played in the rise of the photo mode’s popularity. Before photo modes became the standard in scenic open-world titles, fans of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were using console commands and mods (including lighting and weather effects, poses, and animations) in combination with screen capture devices and software to take photos outside the limitations of fixed visuals and in-game camera systems, leading to the more formal tools seen later in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Meanwhile, young players of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the early 2000s used photography (facilitated by an in-game camera tool) to document and tell stories about the lives of their Sims characters, relying on the interactions of the game’s complex trait systems to provide intrigue and spontaneity. This, in turn, paved the way for modern-day, user-made game entertainment, from game streamers to machinima. Player photography has had a major impact on how and why we use photo modes—or even have them at all (you can read more about this in part in our staff blog later this week).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Highlight and Contrast">Highlight and Contrast</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If this topic fascinates you, there’s still time to submit an article to our blog section about photography games and photo modes in video games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-image-quality-improvements-cpu-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro CPU hasn't been upgraded over the base model, and there are a few reasons why, including the system's main focus.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently commented on the lack of a CPU upgrade for the upcoming console by Sony, saying that price, compatibility, and size are among the reasons. Size, in particular, has been a concern for the Japanese company, even for the base model, as the part of the FPU was cut to reduce size and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>The reception of the PlayStation 4 Pro may also have played some part in the decision not to upgrade the PlayStation 5 Pro CPU. The previous generation's refresh system had a considerable CPU upgrade over the base model, but the main talking point of the system was checkerboard rendering, which brought 4K resolution into the console gaming space for the first time. With the upcoming system, however, the focus is to improve the image quality of Performance mode in several games, and, as such, a CPU upgrade wouldn't have served much purpose other than increasing the price of the system a lot. A more powerful CPU could have allowed for framerates higher than 60 FPS, but it's clear that delivering a high refresh rate experience is not the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/">focus of the PlayStation 5 Pro.</a></p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th for the price of $699.99, €799.99. Despite the high price, analysts expect it to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">as much as the PlayStation 4 Pro did.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-confirms-end-of-splatoon-3-regular-updates.981885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-end-of-splatoon-3-regular-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has now formally confirmed the end of its regular support for Splatoon 3, in a statement celebrating "two ink-credible years". 
</p>
<p>
Fans had suspected such a statement from Nintendo, now <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1835506615971356881">posted</a> to X, following the conclusion of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-reveals-climactic-grand-festival-event-new-amiibo">climactic Grand Festival event</a> held over the past weekend.
</p>
<p>
Released in September 2022, Splatoon 3 has enjoyed a similar two-year window of post-launch content updates seen by its predecessor, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-2-review">Splatoon 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
There's no word on what's next for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> franchise just yet but, of course, Nintendo is now quietly readying itself for the upcoming announcement and 2025 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Splatoon 2 will see returning themes for Splatoween, Frosty Fest, Spring Fest, and Summer Nights. Nintendo will also continue to provide Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges "for the time being". And some balance tweaks to weapons may still be released "as needed".
</p>
<p>
This summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-rescinds-splatoon-3-world-championship-winners-title-after-racist-messages-surface-online">Nintendo rescinded the title of this year's Splatoon 3 World Championship winning team</a> - a North American group named Jackpot - after racist messages by its members subsequently surfaced online. 
</p>
<p>
The Splatoon 3 World Championship was initially due to be held during January's Nintendo Live 2024, but was postponed over safety fears after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suspect-behind-nintendo-live-tokyo-cancellation-death-threats-arrested-in-japan">Nintendo received death threats</a> from a man claiming they would "kill the people at the venue". The individual, a 27-year-old from Hitachi, Japan, was later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">arrested for sending 39 threats</a> using the inquiry form on Nintendo's website.
</p>
<p>
"There are few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3's multiplayer or campaign, but it is the best Nintendo's spectacular series has been to date," Eurogamer's former editor and resident Splatoon fan Martin Robinson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Eurogamer's Splatoon 3 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/new-world-aeternum-open-beta-preview-ps5-xbox-series-x/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>October 1609, Port of Amsterdam. The suspiciously-hooded Father Russo and be-helmeted Captain Thorpe are setting off aboard a galleon in search of the island of legend. There’s immediately a sense of mystery and adventure, the era renowned for exploration and warfare. It’s an inviting setup, and one which immediately calls you to action.</p>
<p>You, of course, no longer being restricted to the youse of PC gaming. We’re just about three years on from the original launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world">New World</a>, with Amazon Games now bringing their colonialist fantasy to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> with New World: Aeternum. We’ve delved into the open beta this past weekend, ahead of the full release on 15th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Open Beta Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BqDhFIjNfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As a member of this ship’s crew, you’re set to explore, discover and gain fame and fortune, but you hadn’t banked on having to breach the Stormwall surrounding Aeternum. This bank of cloud, thunder and lightning looks thoroughly impassable, but Father Russo seems to have, with a mysterious box pulsating with blue light. However, as they attempt to make their way through the storm, an entity takes control of Captain Thorpe, murdering Russo, before making their way through the rest of the crew. Those, at least, that haven’t already been corrupted by the miasma surrounding Aeternum.</p>
<p>You make your way across the burning ship, learning the combat controls as you go, but, with the ship sinking, you soon find yourself on Aeternum’s shore.</p>


<p>You first choose an Archetype for your character, from the regular Soldier, whose heavy armour, sword and shield make him a natural tank/damage hybrid, through the more atypical Damage classes of the Ranger and Musketeer, to the hybrid Mystic class, that combines support magic with damage. I opted for the Swordbearer, their comically big sword giving me Berserk and Monster Hunter vibes. These are the type of vibes I like.</p>
<p>Each class also has it’s own set of Trade Skills to further the tough decision-making process. The Swordbearer has boosts in Leatherworking – this let’s you refine collected hides and turn them into leather – while Cooking and Fishing are also similarly enhanced. There’s a whole host of Trade Skills, with Mining, Weaving and Weaponsmithing just a small selection of the skills on offer.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, New World: Aeternum offers player progression that centres on gaining experience and collecting improved equipment. The opening quests give your starting gear a much-needed upgrade, and from there it becomes about tailoring your build to suit your playstyle. Rarer equipment carries a range of further skills or boosts so you’ll find from the outset you’re digging into the stats and buffs for every single piece. The community has warned during the beta, that New World Aeternum is something of a grind fest, but that’s just part of the territory if you’re an MMORPG fan.</p>

<p>New World Aeternum can be seriously beautiful, and the art design especially captures the incredible otherworldliness of the island of Aeternum.&nbsp; Your character model is less impressive though; while it’s relatively detailed, the animation looks and feels more like you’d expect of a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. Still, this is an MMO after all, and it has rather a lot to juggle.</p>
<p>Playing on Xbox Series X, there’s three different visual settings, with Quality, Performance and 4K giving players the option to tailor their experience. During the beta, there’s been a lot of other players running around every area – I imagine this will lessen through the full release as people move on beyond the opening areas – and it’s one of the things that I’ve always found ruins the grounding of many an MMO.</p>
<p>Still, this obviously has an impact on performance, and the frame rate takes a big tank when you’re in these heavily populated areas, particularly Windsward, the first city. The thing is, New World Aeternum looks far less impressive in Performance mode, dropping the resolution down to such a level that those Xbox 360 comparisons become even more relevant. It’s a shame, because there’s so much to like about the art design, and hopefully the full release will have seen more optimisations, allowing you to see all the wonderful details the team have included, while letting players shoot for 60fps.</p>

<p>Our first experience of New World: Aeternum has been a positive one, offering a beguiling world, intriguing storytelling and enjoyable action combat. Here’s hoping that it can sustain that excitement through many, many hours of adventuring. We’ll be first in line to find out.</p>
