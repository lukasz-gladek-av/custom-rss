			<p>Being the sixth game in a sub-series of a major franchise that churns out sequels every year, my expectations weren’t particularly high going into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. That’s not to throw shade at Treyarch, but it feels like we reach a point every few years where a particular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> format succumbs to a creeping fatigue, prompting a harsh pivot from the next developer to take the reins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the case with Call of Duty Black Ops 6 – if anything, it’s the best the series has been since Infinity Ward’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/04/modern-warfare-review-ps4-pro-xbox-call-of-duty/">2019 Modern Warfare reboot</a> and, personally, marks my favourite entry since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/05/02/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-preview/">Black Ops 2</a> launched more than a decade ago.</p>


<h3>Black Ops 6 Campaign</h3>
<p>Even though the series’ timeline is quickly catching up to the contemporary setting of Modern Warfare, Black Ops 6 underlines how very different these two series still are. In this latest single player campaign, Treyarch continues to dip its toes in real-world history – this time it’s the event surrounding the first Gulf War – while also entangling its core cast of characters in a web of conspiracy where it’s never clear who the true enemy really is.</p>
<p>Following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/17/cod-black-ops-cold-war-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Black Ops Cold War,</a> and with our main man Mason out of the picture, players are cast as CIA operative “Case” – a classically silent protagonist flanked by returning favourite, Woods, and veteran Troy Marshall. After a botched extraction mission in Kuwait, and with the emergence of a shady new faction known as Pantheon, the trio is forced underground to root out this hidden threat before it can enact its master plan.</p>


<p>Although Call of Duty has its fair share of memorable characters, they rarely have as much depth as BO6’s ragtag band of rogue ops who are soon joined by the battle-scarred Adler as well as Felix, a pacifist expert engineer, and the wardrobe-swapping assassin, Sev. It’s not necessarily how these characters are written or acted (though the performances here are top notch, especially Y’lan Noel’s Troy Marshall) but rather how you interact with them.</p>
<p>Between missions, Black Ops 6 transports players back to The Rook – a safehouse where they can engage in deeper conversations with their comrades. It’s an unexpected change of pace compared to the usual A to B blitz of older Call of Duty games, and just as in Black Ops Cold War, it works incredibly well here. Not only does The Rook have various secrets to uncover, it’s also where players can purchase permanent upgrades that will carry over from mission to mission. In other words, you become more powerful as the campaign progresses with collectables (wads of money) having actual value.</p>

<p>The overarching story hardly breaks new ground, though is filled by bombastic set piece action and some rather unexpected detours. One level in particular manages to playfully breaks from reality and almost feels like something out of Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, clever level design is an accentuated part of this year’s campaign. While there are still plenty of gunfighting gauntlets to shoot your way through, there are spy-centric, non-combat segments that slot in seamlessly, and while the overall length of the campaign being longer than what fans have become accustomed to, it doesn’t outstay its welcome. Needless to say, this is one of the most memorable and deftly put together campaigns in COD history.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Zombies</h3>
<p>It’s easy to forget that there’s a small, slavering army who come to Call of Duty every year just to play Zombies. What started as a fun bonus mode for 2008’s World at War, it has continued to grow and mutate over the years with its own rich lore and a dense web of gameplay systems.</p>
<p>After last year’s Warzone adjacent effort, Zombies returns to a wave-based format with two maps available at launch (Liberty Falls and Terminus) playable either in solo or co-op for up to four players. As always, the objective is to stay alive as long as possible as incoming waves get tougher, spewing out larger mobs of zombies (and other twisted nightmares) that will relentlessly pursue survivors.</p>

<p>As players gun down enemies they’ll earn the cash and components needed to buy and upgrade weapons, as well as perks, equipment, field gear, and other bonuses to augment their loadout. They’ll also need funds to access other regions of the map, starting in a relatively small location that quickly expands into a winding, zombie-infested maze. As you explore, there’s various secrets to uncover, events to trigger and a story to reveal.</p>
<p>Lifting the gunplay and character movement from the campaign and multiplayer, Zombies has never felt so smooth. It’s easier than ever to outrun and outmanoeuvre basic enemies though they continue to pour out of every crevice, ramping up the tension and forcing you to think about your loadout. Other highlights from this mode include joint-progression with BO6’s competitive multiplayer, as well as the option to exit out of a solo run and then pick back up where you left it later.</p>
<h3>Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>
<p>For almost two decades and across more than a dozen Call of Duty games, I’ve fallen into a pattern of blitzing the campaign first before dabbling in the co-op/bonus game mode, then fully immersing myself in the multiplayer. Like the majority of players, this is where I spend the bulk of my time with each year’s instalment and Black Ops 6 will be no exception.</p>
<p>Since Infinity Ward’s superb Modern Warfare reboot, online gameplay has stuck to a familiar template with small tweaks and changes. Quirks such as being able to reload when aiming down sights and the ability to “mount” cover points are now ingrained in the COD formula, but what party tricks does Treyarch bring to the table? Omnidirectional movement. When this feature was first unveiled it was presented as a game-changing evolution, giving players the power to sprint, slide, and even dive in any direction.</p>

<p>This change will impact diehards plugged into Call of Duty and Warzone all year round, but for it will feel far more subtle for more seasonal fans, as if Treyarch has removed the imaginary sandbags that have been weighing down character movement. The changes feel natural and are easy to grasp, and they do have a knock-on effect when it comes to the tempo of skirmishes and the dexterity needed to outplay opponents in 1-on-1 gunfights.</p>
<p>In terms of content, this is exactly what you want from the Call of Duty multiplayer package: an expansive arsenal of highly customisable weapons and fun killstreaks with plenty of game modes and maps on rotation. Speaking of modes, the new Kill Order is a welcome addition that tasks teams with hunting down enemy HVTs (high value targets) while defending their own. Meanwhile, the twelve original maps offer an intriguing mix of locales that have been meticulously designed to encourage various playstyles, though some are arguably better suited for those who favour long range combat. That’s not to say that snipers will have a hard time wreaking havoc in Black Ops 6 – you just need to be mindful that the increased speed and movement of targets will present a challenge.</p>

<p>It took a dozen or matches, across various modes, for the multiplayer to finally click. That’s nothing out of the ordinary for Call of Duty. It usually takes hours of play until players can start crafting their own preferred loadouts and figure out the meta, and even longer to get acquainted with all the new maps. However, some fans will find it harder than others to adjust to the quicker pace of BO6, the scrappy close-range faceoffs, and wild acrobatics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-initially-didnt-want-troy-baker-playing-indiana-jones-in-the-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Troy Baker is one of the most prolific voice actors out there and has been in nearly everything you can think of. From voicing Joel in The Last of Us to Kanji Tatsumi in Persona 4, he has taken up a ton of roles. He's not only a voice actor in games, though, as he also appears in plenty of English dubs of anime, as well as other animated programs. When it came to choosing someone to play Indiana Jones in the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Todd Howard initially rejected the idea of Troy Baker being the one to do it.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone had the opportunity to have a discussion with both Howard and Baker before the launch of the Indy game on December 9. Here, they discussed how the game came to be and how Baker ended up getting involved. It was first announced that Troy Baker was going to be filling Harrison Ford's shoes in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle in January. Since then, we've slowly been learning more details about the game. "He really brings forward that charm and sense of humor in such a good way," said MachineGames Co-Founder and Game Director Jerk Gustaffson. As the person who got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/">preview the game</a>, it's safe to admit that Troy Baker did a great job of acting as Indiana Jones and managed to get his humor and wittiness down pat.</p>
<p>Todd Howard has long wanted to make an Indiana Jones game, but when he was searching for the person to fill the role, he found that Baker didn't give him the vibe he wanted. An article via <a href="https://ew.com/indiana-jones-troy-baker-the-great-circle-exclusive-8426963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> discusses the meeting between Baker and Howard.</p>
<p>"Upon being introduced for the first time through Zoom, Baker confirms Howard flat out told the actor to his face that he wasn't what they wanted." After the team at MachineGames and Howard had completed hundreds of interviews for the role, it was confirmed people chose Troy Baker every time. It's been confirmed that Troy Baker really went the extra mile to be able to fill the boots of Indiana Jones. He's a self-confessed fanatic, and trained with an authentic Indiana Jones-like whip with stunt actor Doc Duhame.</p>
<p>"I better know how to ride a motorcycle, ride a horse, crack a whip... Because if you don't believe me when I'm just standing there holding the whip, you're probably not going to believe it when you're actually the one cracking the whip," Baker said in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> with Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the Indiana Jones game, make sure to keep an eye out for its release on December 9, 2024.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-series-tops-500m-sales-black-ops-6-enjoys-franchises-biggest-launch.1024224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series sales have topped the 500 million mark, and Microsoft has also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch ever.</p>

<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, Activision confirmed the massive sales milestone for the first-person shooter franchise, and that milestone likely explains why Microsoft's gaming revenue <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increased 61%</a> in the first quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, with 53 of those points <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">driven by Activision</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, in an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&nbsp;described&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch as "the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>launch ever", pointing to its "record for day one players as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day</a>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=eaNISuAl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=szBY8Sit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s success has added to a huge sales milestone for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole.</figcaption></figure><p>Nadella didn't give any specifics regarding sales figures or Game Pass subscriber adds for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, although as Eurogamer notes, he did previously say that Bethesda's spacefaring RPG&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfield-passes-11-million-players-sets-record-of-most-new-game-pass-subscriptions-on">set a similar record last year</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this monumental success, as well as&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s sales figures as a whole, will no doubt add to the happiness Nadella feels about scoring an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">eye-watering payrise</a> this year despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">massive layoffs</a> across his company.</p>

<p>If you've somehow missed out on the hype,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running and phenomenally successful <i>Call of Duty&nbsp;</i>franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a co-development effort between longtime&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>studio Treyarch and Raven Software, who also collaborated on 2020's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>. It boasts a single-player campaign, as well as the usual multiplayer and zombies modes.</p>




<p>Despite its massive success,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has garnered its fair share of controversy as well, with elements like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online">always-online campaign</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option">paid audio package</a> drawing fire from irate fans.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">not via Xbox Game Pass Standard or Core</a>.</p>

            <p>Inflexion Games are closing their UK office, laying off staff and restructuring their main Canadian studio after failing to find commercial success with their Victorian fantasy survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>. Reportedly, at least 22 people have been let go.</p><!--more-->
<p>Nightingale launched in early access in February this year. At the time, we said it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-few-hours-nightingale-feels-like-one-of-the-weirder-elder-scrolls-rpgs">significant charm</a> but also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/will-nightingales-crafting-card-menus-be-its-downfall">significant flaws</a>, with Ed eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">summarising it</a> as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". The developers soon treated the early access build to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingales-realms-rebuilt-update-arrives-tomorrow-and-aims-to-revive-the-game-with-a-handcrafted-campaign">a comprehensive overhaul</a>, shifting the focus away from procedurally generated landscapes and toward "handcrafted" stories. But it hasn't been enough to keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>In a social media update this week, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn writes that "like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we've had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members". The early access launch, he goes on, "hasn't been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio's previous size". </p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Reports that the Inflexion had shut down their UK division began to circulate last week, following developer posts on LinkedIn. An anonymous studio source has told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that at least 22 people have been laid off, based on internal correspondence.</p><p>Flynn is the former general manager of BioWare. He founded Inflexion in 2018 as part of Improbable, who sold the studio to Tencent in 2022. In February this year, Flynn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-new-games-struggle-because-evergreen-hits-like-fortnite-pull-players-towards-them-at-all-times-says-former-bioware-gm">spoke to me</a> about the difficulty of establishing a new online survival builder like Nightingale in the face of "evergreen" giants like Fortnite and Minecraft. I certainly don't fancy the chances of anybody going up against those games, but again, Nightingale launched with some obvious issues, not least an interface as baroque as the setting.</p>
<p>I'm still hoping Inflexion can turn it around, as a fan of Carrollian whimsy and Tarot cards, but that's of no use to the people who've lost their jobs. If you're among them, best of luck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>LR 7.62 is the second bolt-action sniper rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that can deal high damage with minimal recoil. So, here’s the best LR 7.62 loadout in BO6 with the right set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-lr-7-62-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lr-7-62">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-lr-7-62-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best LR 7.62 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Lightweight Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser</strong>: Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a>, the LR 7.62 loadout benefits the most if you have the Gunfighter Wildcard equipped which allows eight attachments in total.</p>



<p>Starting with the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, this attachment will suppress gun sounds without giving away your location on the minimap. The <strong>Short Barrel</strong> takes time to unlock but will drastically improve the Jumping Aim Down Speed and Jumping Sprint to Fire Speeds.</p>



<p>The <strong>Lightweight Handguard</strong> underbarrel will reduce the strength of sway when aiming down sights. The <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> significantly improves the reload, aiming, and sprint-to-fire speeds of the LR 7.62. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> helps improve the aiming speed but comes at a cost of increased flinch resistance – this gets countered when you attach the <strong>Combat Stock</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>Target Laser</strong> drastically improves Aiming Idle Sway Delay and Aim Walking Steadiness, enhancing the accuracy of the sniper. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will improve the Rechamber Speed.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lr-7-62">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for LR 7.62</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>

<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>

<p>As a sniper, <strong>Recon</strong> is the best specialty for you and to activate that, simply equip the Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded Perks. This will allow you to see enemies through walls for a short duration after every time you respawn.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will help you deal lethal damages and fast health top-ups while <strong>Trophy System</strong> will prevent enemy projectiles from eliminating you.</p>

<p>Grekhova is the ideal secondary weapon for the LR 7.62. It’s a fully automatic pistol that will increase the firepower of your loadout as your primary is not an automatic weapon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods.1024191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been just two days since Rockstar Games finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the official version of Red Dead Redemption PC, and modders haven't been idle. There are already plenty of useful mods, particularly for those keen to improve on the game's aged visuals.</p>
<p>Nexus Mods already hosts several texture mods for Red Dead Redemption PC. The most impressive of the current bunch might be '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Marston Reworked 4K Upscaled</a>', created by user modgamer767. This mod overhauls the protagonist's textures, bringing them to 4K resolution with the help of AI upscaling.</p>
<p>It's not just about character and environment textures - even particles need to be overhauled for such an old game. Luckily, a mod was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> by Nexus Mods user FiK that improves at least some particles, such as smoke, sparks, and some environmental effects, thanks to 4K upscaling.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption PC also includes the acclaimed expansion Undead Nightmare, so DerEhrwurden thought they'd <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/83" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> some of those assets as well. For now, they have upscaled the undead animals from 1024x1024 to 2048x2048, but they plan to finish most of the Undead assets eventually. Last but not least, user Chainner has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> a 4X upscale of grass textures to improve their look.</p>
<p>This is merely the beginning of PC modding for Rockstar's masterpiece. For example, the maker of the comprehensive Reality Redemption Overhaul Project has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to bring the mod to PC (it was previously available for Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch) very soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, are you enjoying this version of the game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-hemorrhaging-money-after-high-profile-flops.1024188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its financial results for the first half of the fiscal year, and if you've been following the company's fortunes recently, then it probably won't come as a shock to you to learn that things aren't looking good.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary</a>, Ubisoft reveals that it's effectively hemorrhaging money right now; the company lost&nbsp;€271.8 million in the period between April and September this year, and it's currently staring down the barrel of around&nbsp;€1 billion's worth of debt.</p>

<p>In addition, net bookings are down 22% year-on-year, while digital revenues have fallen 27% and player spending (although Ubisoft uses the somewhat ghoulish term "recurring investment") has fallen 39% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=g7fbpxOf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=luABiqCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>High-profile flops like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>have driven poor performance for Ubisoft in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>These doomy numbers are likely driven largely by the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which Ubisoft has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">admitted didn't perform according to its expectations</a>, although the company doesn't mention the game in these latest financial results, nor does it give official sales numbers.</p>

<p>Rather cunningly, Ubisoft refers to its "unique player" count rather than its sales in an <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5XbTPPv7a94dZmmmhSwtDA/c091b601b2b467f5829465c26d0b8551/Ubisoft_H1_FY25_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying presentation</a>, declaring that "more than 30 million unique active players" played&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise over the last twelve months.</p>

<p>The company also says its cost reduction plan is "well on track", with its "total headcount" dropping by over 2,000 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lays-off-124-people-to-streamline-operations-and-enhance-collective-efficiency">over the past 24 months</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, the presentation and its accompanying slideshow paint a pretty grim picture for Ubisoft, and that's probably a result the company doesn't feel it needs after a prolonged period of turmoil.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=BBb3O36u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=6iwePV2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is releasing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>annus horribilis&nbsp;</em>arguably began with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>back in February, with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16299/skull-and-bones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critics</a> and players alike responding to the long-awaited pirate game with a resounding "eh".</p>

<p>Following that, a prominent investor in the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> in September, calling out perceived failures in management and company policy on the part of Ubisoft's owners the Guillemots.</p>

<p>Major release <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>was subsequently delayed to February 2025, alongside which Ubisoft revealed that&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed and confirmed a return to day-one Steam releases for its PC games, as well as the abandonment of the traditional season pass model for DLC.</p>

<p>More investor threats followed, alongside a declaration of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">employee strike action</a> over return-to-work policies and poor pay. All of that is in addition to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">data policy lawsuit</a> that Ubisoft is currently facing.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these issues stopped Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game">releasing a rather oddly-timed NFT game</a>&nbsp;last week. One rather suspects this isn't the sort of strategy Ubisoft needs to get back on track, but I suppose we'll have to wait and see.</p>

        <p><em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> began life as a remaster of the original title before D-Pad Studio got carried away by their enthusiasm and ended up creating a full blown sequel to the original title. <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em> takes the shoot ’em up <a title="Genres > Platformer [561 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a> to new heights, with a host of new content that more than doubles the size of the original game. Venture through five stages, each with their own unique gimmick, across which you’ll have to battle Laser Sharks, robotic space invaders and even an immortal Samurai. To beat these new stages and take down the bosses at the end of each, you’ll have a new double jump, cancel-jump and mid-air powershots to add to your arsenal. There’s also a new endless Survival Mode, new difficulties modes—including a <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,068 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System-style, no checkpoints Hardcore Mode— and 36 newly composed songs from acclaimed Norwegian musician Savant.</p><p>In <em>Savant: Ascent REMIX</em>, you play as the Alchemist, who’s been cast down from his tower by an unknown force. Your goal is to ascend back to the top, with your movement limited at all times to two platforms, be they moving elevators or space debris.

            <p>If you want to learn more about the various creatures and species coming to Exodus on the game's release, Matthew McConaughey has you covered.</p>
<p>The actor has been narrating a number of YouTube videos for the sci-fi RPG, offering a look into its world. The videos are made to highlight the "darker" side of Exodus, developer Archetype says.</p>
<p>Videos showcasing Exodus' creatures include a detailed look at pangolin-esque creatures known as Arkavir, and others that detail Awakened Ravens. Lastly, there's one for Awakened Bears.</p>

<p>The Arkavir are described as "a monstrous and heavily adaptable race of creatures created by the Celestials to be a disposable workforce". And, who are the Celestials, you may ask. These are a "diverse" range of alien peoples, who are humanity's "greatest enemy".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/dig-vr-is-getting-a-500000-collectors-edition-includes-two-jcb-extractors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Collector’s editions all try to contain something special for the most diehard of fans to get their hands on, by spending a bit more. Many contain statues or other physical goodies, along with some exclusive digital content. The most expensive one that was ever released was the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/09/saints-row-ivs-insane-1000000-pre-order-bonus-detailed/">Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition,</a> which was priced at $1million and offered a Lamborghini Gallardo. Today, Wired Productions has announced a £500,000 collector’s edition for DIG VR. While you won’t get a Lamborghini Gallardo, the buyer would get two custom wrapped JCB 100c-2 excavators.</p>



<p>One of the excavators will be wrapped by Asheville, and the buyer will be able to discuss with them what kind of wrap they want. The other excavator will be wrapped with reference to DIG VR. That is not all the buyer of this Dig VR Collector’s Edition will get. They would also get two Meta Quest 3 VR headsets, two copies of DIG VR, a year’s pass to Diggerland in Kent, a trip to Las Vegas to visit Dig This, a tour of the JCB Museum in the UK, custom hard hat and high vis jacket, their name added to the game credits, and a sticker sheet.</p>
<p>Will the DIG VR Collector’s Edition actually sell? The audience of someone having £500,000 available and being a massive JCB enthusiast will be very small, I imagine. There was no evidence ever provided that the Saints Row 4 Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition ever sold, so if someone did buy this they would set a spending record on a game collector’s edition.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-now-requires-devs-to-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-measures-on-steam.1024146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that developers who want to put their games on Steam will need to disclose whether those games are using any kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software going forward.</p>

<p>Announcing the changes via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks community page</a>, Valve says this is a change that's been requested by both developers and players; devs want better options to "share anti-cheat information" with players, while players are requesting more anti-cheat "transparency".</p>

<p>To that end, a new field has been added in which developers can indicate the anti-cheat software that comes with their game. If a developer's game contains kernel-level and client-side anti-cheat measures, then those measures must be disclosed via this new field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=8kk1YJzE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=0MDDgsSn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Online games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>often use anti-cheat software to prevent hacks and other exploits.</figcaption></figure><p>This also applies to games that are already on Steam, so developers who are currently using kernel-level anti-cheat solutions will need to add this disclosure to their games' Steam pages.</p>

<p>If games are using anti-cheat that isn't kernel-based or is server-side, then their developers aren't technically required to disclose this information, but Valve says it thinks that letting players know about this would be beneficial on both sides.</p>

<p>If you're a Steam developer, you can find this new option in your Steamworks landing page, under the "Edit Store Page" heading. A new "Anti-Cheat" option will be available, and Valve says it's made a list of the most common software providers so you can easily fill out the field.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if a Steam page already discloses its measures somewhere else in its text, then that information should now be migrated to the new field and removed from the existing area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=BfMLwYiM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=EomXAilH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, have been the subject of controversy thanks to anti-cheat software.</figcaption></figure><p>Plenty of games use kernel-level anti-cheat measures, with big guns like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-infinite-march-update-preview"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-getting-easy-anti-cheat-and-removing-game-pass-requirement-for-solo"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, and more incorporating it into their online components.</p>

<p>However, some games have been the subject of controversy due to their anti-cheat measures.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, for instance, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-vulnerability-discovered">vulnerability was discovered</a> in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s anti-cheat protocols potentially allowed hackers to bypass users' virus protection, and the game didn't even need to be installed for players to be susceptible.</p>

<p>In July that same year, VR social platform<em>&nbsp;VRChat&nbsp;</em>implemented Easy Anti-Cheat, one of the most popular anti-cheat solutions, thereby also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vrchat-mods-ban-by-easy-anti-cheat-addition-sparks-community-outrage">banning the use of mods</a> for the platform, a decision that wasn't exactly received well by the&nbsp;<em>VRChat&nbsp;</em>community.</p>

Priced at $479, the 9800X3D is a direct successor to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">best gaming CPU on the market</a> right now, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. There’s a lot to be excited about with this next-generation X3D chip, too.</p><p>AMD is increasing the base clock speed up to 4.7GHz on the 9800X3D, with a max boost of 5.2GHz. Combined with an increase to a 120-watt TDP, this may well help improve productivity workloads — something the X3D chips have always fallen behind their non-X3D counterparts on.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD claims its 9800X3D is on average 8 percent faster than the 7800X3D.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>The 9800X3D is really focused on gaming, though. AMD is calling it “the world’s best gaming processor,” and promising an 8 percent uplift in average FPS over the 7800X3D. Those gains are thanks to the Zen 5 architecture and a second generation of 3D V-Cache technology. </p><p>AMD even claims the 9800X3D will be up to 20 percent better than Intel’s latest Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming. In a <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1851970613604126789">video announcement</a>, AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh reveals that “in many games such as <em>Far Cry 6</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> we are more than 40 percent faster.”</p><p>The 9800X3D is also the first X3D processor to be fully unlocked, allowing enthusiasts and gamers to overclock it and squeeze more performance out of their systems. AMD is launching the Ryzen 7 9800X3D on November 7th, priced at $479.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’re essentially making a choice on which city and faction will be in a better position to help you when the time comes, and putting Neve or Lucanis on a specific path in their stories and even combat roles. Here’s the rundown of the consequences.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The person you don’t help will temporarily leave the party</li><li>When they return, they will be considered “hardened,” which locks out parts of their skill tree and makes it harder to progress their relationship without higher approval throughout the game</li><li>You will lose some choice in Neve and Lucanis’ personal storylines, and they will be forced to go down one direction because of the circumstances</li><li>The city you don’t save will be blighted, altering quest lines and dialogue, and cutting off access to the local faction’s shop</li><li>The Shadow Dragons or Antivan Crows will have a baseline loss in allied strength points, meaning it will be impossible to max them out</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-recommend-id="image://d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-recommend-id="image://d0da54cd91dbea5d21ada0ed5a735d7a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at his team while Harding asks &quot;What's our move, Rook?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Overall, it’s still a binary choice that evens itself out, but it will have pretty direct ramifications on your relationship with Neve and Lucanis above all else. It’s still possible to reach the end of their storylines (including having them become a Hero of the Veilguard, which is the equivalent to reaching maximum Loyalty in the <em>Mass Effect</em> series) and make up for the loss in allied power, but it will take more sidequests to make it happen, and you won’t have the shop to sell valuables to in order to juice those numbers.</p><p>What I’m unsure of as of this writing is whether or not it locks you out of Neve and Lucanis’ respective romances. I saved Minrathous in my playthrough and my relationship with Lucanis was slow to progress for a bit, so I didn’t see any further options to flirt and eventually locked in my romance with Davrin.

<p>The specs for the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU have been leaked online ahead of the processor’s official release. European comparison website Geizhals (first spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extensive-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-specs-leak-details-unlocked-120w-cpu-with-5-2-ghz-boost-clock">Tom’s Hardware</a>) has posted the full specs of the new chip that shows some solid improvements over its predecessors.</p>



<p>Before getting into the leaked specs, it’s worth noting that none of this has been officially confirmed by AMD. That means that some of the details could be slightly different from the actual information.</p>



<p>According to the leaked specs, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D features a base clock speed of 4.7 GHz with a boost clock of up to 5.2 GHz. The base clock comes in at 500 MHz higher than the 7800X3D. It also features a TDP of 120W along with 8MB of L2 cache and 96MB of L3 cache.</p>



<p>As far as pricing goes, that wasn’t part of the specs leak. However, recent rumors suggest that it will cost $479, $30 more than the 7800X3D. The CPU is expected to release November 7.</p>



<p>You can check out the rest of the leaked specs for the processor below:</p>

            <p>
A union for UK-based video game developers has launched its first manifesto, with ambitions to improve conditions for its 1500 members.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the Independent Workers of Great Union (IWGB) says it wants to improve job security and the industry's reliance on enforced overtime, often known as crunch.
</p>
<p>
The manifesto launch comes at a time when countless companies are laying off workers, with 900 UK game developers laid off across the country last year. Globally, that number is currently <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> at around 13,000 in 2024 alone.

<p>
Originally founded five years ago, the IWGB says its membership has grown as a result of the layoffs of the past few years, with a spike in membership of 50 percent over the past 12 months. 
</p>
<p>
"The games industry has reached a tipping point," Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers Branch said. "After another year battling this relentless onslaught of layoffs, workers are realising that things urgently need to change, and are unionising on a scale never seen before. 
</p><p>
"The people who choose to work in the games sector are some of the most passionate, creative, dedicated people you'll ever meet, and studio bosses rely on that passion to exploit us without fair pay, conditions or job security. Together, we can make sure the games industry's future looks very different. Stable work, fair pay, a balanced work schedule - all these are well within reach if we stand together to demand them in unison."
</p>
<p>
The manifesto, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/">which is now available online</a>, lists the following key initiatives. On working hours and overtime, it wants to ensure "no overtime" rules cannot be enforced, and any voluntary overtime is properly compensated. There's also mention of a push to a four-day work week, and a guarantee of mental health days as part of sick leave. 
</p>
<p>
On pay, the manifesto asks that annual increases keep pace with inflation, and compare more favourably to other countries with equal costs of living. There's mention of ending the gender pay gap via submission of data to the Gender Pay Gap service, plus equal parental leave and ownership models or bonus schemes to more equitably share company profits. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the manifesto calls for transparent pay, particularly for management teams, notice periods for fixed-term contracts, and guarantees for being credited on projects - even if you are no longer at the company. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">Sony's former president suggested games industry layoffs were not the result of corporate greed</a> and anyone affected was free to go "drive an Uber".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/inflexion-games-cuts-staff-due-to-low-commercial-success-of-nightingale-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Inflexion Games has announced that it is reducing staff numbers, primarily because the early access phase for its PvE game Nightingale has not been commercially successful enough to maintain its current size. As a result, Inflexion Games will be closing its UK office and is undergoing a restructure in its Canada office. The full statement from CEO Aaryn Flynn can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 Trailer | Gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLcyuMZqcG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The past few weeks here at Inflexion Games have been incredibly challenging, and no words can adequately express the sadness we feel. Like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Although we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished with Nightingale to date – as well as the enthusiasm and support from our community – the Early Access release hasn’t been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio’s previous size. As a result, we’re undergoing a restructuring process in Canada, and we will also be closing our UK office.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Our priority is to support each member of the team affected by the reductions as they search for new opportunities. We thank them for their invaluable contributions to Nightingale – it would not have been possible without their immense talent and passion for adventuring in the Faewilds. While this is a difficult moment for the entire team, we will continue to work tirelessly, alongside our players, as we move forward as a studio. I will be available to answer questions from the community and will provide more details on our upcoming updates soon. In the meantime, I hope our players will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks to our departing team members for everything they have contributed.”</em></p>

<p>Nightingale launched into early access in February this, and in September a major update called Realms Rebuilt was released, that added a new campaign, new bosses, and a lot of changes to the way the game works. It also allowed players to build bigger estates for themselves. Going by this week’s announcement, it seems that this major update has not had the desired effect of significantly increasing the player base.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-bespoke-music-streaming-app-nintendo-music.1024095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the aptly-named Nintendo Music, a streaming app that allows you to listen to a selection of Nintendo tunes via your smartphone.</p>

<p>You'll have to be a Switch Online member to use it, although unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween">N64 games</a> or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks">rather strange playtest</a> that popped up recently, you won't need the Expansion Pack addon. There's no option to use the app if you're not a Switch Online member, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have an active Switch Online membership, though, you can expect an app that offers music from the likes of <i>Mario</i>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and more. The app lets you listen either to individual songs, full soundtracks, or playlists, and you can also create your own playlists if you like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=lQw9fTDn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=5VAxku2g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Music lets you listen to all kinds of Nintendo tunes.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, Nintendo Music works like a Nintendo-exclusive version of apps like Spotify. As you listen, the app will learn your tastes, and it'll start recommending music to you based on what you've listened to before.</p>

<p>Additionally, new music will continually be added to Nintendo Music over time, so if a soundtrack you love isn't on there yet, there's a good chance it will be at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Since this is a gaming music-exclusive app, it's also got a couple of fun features that other streaming apps don't have, like the ability to extend certain tracks "to run for up to an hour" or even the ability to block spoilers by hiding specific soundtracks.</p>




<p>As the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 continues</a>, it's fair to say Nintendo doesn't seem to be in much of a rush to announce the new console, or even to tease more news about it.</p>

<p>That said, the gaming giant did technically announce new hardware earlier this month...in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-alarmo-interactive-alarm-clock">alarm clock Alarmo</a>, which plays Nintendo-themed sounds and visual scenes to help you wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo Music is available right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604?l=en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>. You'll need a Nintendo account and a Switch Online membership to use it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xbox%E2%80%99s-perfect-dark.1024089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The creative director of Marvel’s Wolverine has reportedly left the game to work for Xbox and its Perfect Dark reboot. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a>, Brian Horton left Insomniac over the summer. He is now the creative director on Perfect Dark, which is being developed by The Initiative.</p>



<p>An Xbox representative told Game File that Horton will be “bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series”.</p>



<p>Totilo’s report states that Horton left Insomniac and Wolverine as part of creative changes around the game. Another move made was that Cameron Christian is no longer game director on Wolverine. Instead, he moves to a different, currently unknown, role within the studio.  </p>



<p>Taking over as Wolverine’s game director and creative director are Mike Daly and Marcus Smith, respectively. The two were the leads on Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Sony for comment on the changes, but no response was received.</p>



<p>Perfect Dark has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-perfect-dark-game-in-rough-shape-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of reported issues</a> with development over the years. However, this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer saw a new look</a> at the game released during Xbox’s Summer Showcase. </p>



<p>Regarding Wolverine, the last look fans received came via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ransomware-group-leaks-over-1-3-million-files-in-insomniac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Insomniac leak</a> from 2023. The game was first announced in 2021, but Insomniac <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be “gearing up”</a> to showcase more of the game in the near future. </p>



<p>As far as a release date for Perfect Dark or Wolverine, none have been officially announced. Rumors suggest that Wolverine could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release sometime in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the shakeup at both PlayStation’s Wolverine and Xbox’s Perfect Dark? Let us know down below, or in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/two-point-museum-preview-dust-off-your-leather-elbow-patches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two Point Studios must have a thing for leather elbow patches. A stereotypical part of college and university professor dress for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus</a>, they’re also pretty prevalent in museum curators, I’m sure. Hence, Two Point Museum –&nbsp;the latest management sim that will have you reviving an ailing industry across Two Point County.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Supernatural Trailer (PEGI ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3OAKLaDRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the elbow patches remain the same, and the general gist of a management sim will be familiar, the actual workings of a museum are rather different to a hospital or university. Instead of managing a flow from diagnosis through to treatment, or trying to teach and train students to get a passing grade from one semester to another, a museum has much more in common with a theme park. You want a museum to entertain as much as it should enlighten, and there needs to be a flow through the building, taking people from exhibit to exhibit, before dumping them into a gift shop to buy all the kinds of tat that will actually pay the bills.</p>


<p>The thing you really need to be thinking about when designing a layout and an exhibit is the “buzz” that it provides, the excitement and interest that it instills in your guests. As wondrous as a giant prehistoric footprint might be, it means very little without a bit of info alongside, so you’ll naturally want to put up a few info stands to provide that. And since it’s a prehistoric artefact, why not dress up the environment a little to theme it around this? You will want an expert on hand to make sure that a stand is well preserved and maintained, but between the buzz it generates, the knowledge that is imparted and the general decoration that you put down, you’ll build up the environment score of an exhibit.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to place some donation bins for people to chuck coins into as a reward for your hard work. That’s before they get to the gift shops that you can fill with themed items to match your museum and exhibits.</p>


<p>The building tools are really nice and straightforward, bringing the ease of creation from the previous games, dropping items down with a handy snap to grid to keep things in order, creating blueprints for rooms, and more. There’s some really extensive colour options to let you get exactly the look that you want, and there’s greater ease for putting things on an angle with diagonal internal walls, halved floor tiles, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, just because they’re paying your bills doesn’t mean you can really trust visitors. Whether it’s vandals, thieves or invariably bored children getting up to no good, you’ll need to have security cameras and guards meandering around to try and make sure your exhibits are kept in good order. You can help to keep them on the rails, as it were, with tour guides that take groups through the museum in a more orderly fashion, as well.</p>
<p>As you would expect, there’s a great humorous twist to all of the exhibits that you can display through your museums, with Two Point Studios well known for their pun-filled games. I particularly enjoy the stone-carved computers, goofy looking dioramas, frozen prehistoric men still in their ice blocks, and even when it’s a fairly sensible looking dino skeleton, it’s got a great cartoony style. The marine life museum goes all in on oversized tentacle monsters and strange-looking fish, while the freshly announced ghost museum has you featuring spectres in Polterguest Rooms, floating furniture, haunted TVs and puppets, and more.</p>

<p>But where do these exhibits come from? You can’t just pop to the history shop to buy a Sharpontops skeleton, after all. This is where your hired experts come in handy, as you send them out on expeditions to dig sites and other locations to try and find those precious artefacts and bring them back. You can choose how much time and leeway they should have on these missions, whether speedy, safe or detailed in their search, and that will impact how likely they are to be successful in bringing things back. Skeletons will take multiple expeditions to find all of the parts, and each expedition location on the map will have a number of discoverable items to search for.</p>
<p>Should they find something, they’ll come back with a big ol’ crate for you to open up&nbsp;– replete with a glorious loot crate animation –&nbsp;and then decide where you want it to go.</p>

<p>That’s not the only thing that they can bring back with them, as a risk of every expedition is that experts come back with some kind of physical ailment. They could end up with sticky feet that make them tardy, they could be snake bitten, and plenty more besides. Thankfully it’s not too difficult to sort them out with recovery pods that you can place in the staff room for them to heal up in –&nbsp;I’d love to see some kind of tie in back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/30/two-point-hospital-review/">Two Point Hospital</a>. but this might be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>After Hospital and Campus, Two Point Museum brings another fresh setting for the team’s fun-filled take on management games. I’ve really enjoyed the themes revealed so far, and can’t wait to see what the wider game has in store when it comes out in March.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard delivers decent image quality and great performance on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, complete with ray tracing in Quality Mode.</p>
<p>In a new tech review posted a few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the console versions of the latest entry in the series by BioWare, confirming details such as resolution, visual features, and more. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game runs at 1080p resolution, upscaled to 4K using a custom version of AMD FSR 2.2 complete with some ray tracing features like ray-traced reflections and ambient occlusion in Quality Mode, and at 720p, upscaled to 1440p using dynamic resolution that can drop as low as 504p. Still, AMD FSR 2.2 seems to be doing a decent job, and image quality isn't massively impacted even with such low resolution, although it is definitely noticeable under scrutiny. Performance, at least, seems to be solid, consistently hitting the 60 FPS target.</p>
<p>Things don't fare as well on Xbox Series S. On the system, Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs at 648p in Quality Mode and 432p in Performance Mode, targeting 30 and 60 FPS, respectively. Despite some issues, such as a lack of motion blur in Quality Mode that prevents the 30 FPS gameplay from being smoother and lower image quality in Performance Mode, Digital Foundry found the experience serviceable on the system.</p>
