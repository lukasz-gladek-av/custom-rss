<p>The demo will give you a small taste of what the co-op horror title will have to offer, with Tarsier Studios previously stating that solo players will have no problem experiencing the game if you can't find anyone to join you.</p>
<p>Reanimal is somewhat of a spiritual successor to <strong>Little Nightmares</strong>, which Tarsier Studios worked on before development passed over to Supermassive Games for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">third entry</a>. It looks to be an altogether more disturbing experience as the story follows two siblings to work to escape a hellish environment full of grotesque creatures.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ztmxvp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

              <p><span>Staff redundancies are anticipated at Ubisoft Stockholm and Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft has announced. 55 employees are expected to lose their jobs, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><span>according to a statement sent to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Massive, acquired back in 2008, is the studio behind </span><i><span>The Division 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement, Ubisoft explained, “This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements, and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect in line with local regulations,” Ubisoft said.</span></p> <h2>Ubisoft’s slow, painful transformation</h2> <p><span>The news comes months after the French publisher began a new cost-cutting restructuring plan. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>Back in October 2025</span></a><span>, it asked developers at Massive to lay themselves off voluntarily.</span></p>

 <p><span>The publisher’s redundancy scheme came after a new deal with Tencent, in which the conglomerate invested over $1 billion in a smaller subsidiary, Vantage Studios. The new studio will focus on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Siege</span></i><span> franchises.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> notes that despite the new layoffs, updates for </span><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</span></i><span> will continue, as will development for </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> and the survival extraction mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>News of job cuts at Ubisoft is not new. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752"><span>Last week, Ubisoft closed its Halifax office after it unionized.</span></a><span> The shuttering of the mobile game developer resulted in the loss of 71 jobs. The publisher claimed that the closure was not due to unionization.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-transfer-market-out-of-control/</link>
            <guid>1404724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Vitality’s award-winning IGL, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire, has voiced <strong>strong concerns </strong>about the state of the Counter-Strike 2 transfer market. He has argued that the current pricing climate has made roster changes (especially meaningful ones) almost <strong>impossible </strong>for most organizations in the space.</p>



<p>In the wake of the HLTV Award Show, during which apEX secured an award for IGL of the Year, he suggested that even the biggest organizations in Counter-Strike are being priced out of making key moves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-the-counter-strike-market">What’s Wrong with the Counter-Strike Market?</h2>



<p>According to apEX, the financial expectations around player buyouts have reached a critical point. Even well-funded organizations can’t engage, and teams that want to ‘shake things up’ simply can’t. They’re backing off because quotes are ‘completely unrealistic’.</p>



<p>He also stated that the Counter-Strike esports ecosystem doesn’t generate enough revenue to justify skyrocketing buyout demands that have surged in the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s the full quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many teams wanted to make a change, I guess, but they couldn’t. The transfer market is crazy. The prices are “What the f**k is going on?” In CS, we don’t make enough money to make changes, all those prizes are crazy. That’s why we hear nothing from NAVI, no MOUZ as well, who wanted to shuffle, I’m pretty sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/75019-apex-cs2-transfer-market-is-crazy-the-prices-are-on-what-the-f-k-is-going-on-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escore</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>ApEX explained that the quiet offseason and the lack of transfers can be attributed specifically to this issue.</p>



<p>The looming shadow over the market remains Team Falcons, the Saudi-backed organization that has the largest coffers in the esports world. In the last few years, the company has soared in the competitive gaming space, buying out killer squads in multiple games.</p>



<p>But even Team Falcons neglected to make any changes during the winter freeze. If Team Falcons is hesitating, then the pricing issue must be <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>



<p>ApEX’s comments reflect the growing concern amongst players that the CS2 transfer market is overheating. If buyout quotes continue to rise faster than team revenues do on a comparative scale, the top organizations willbe forced to delay or abandon roster plans and rebuilds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA has announced that it is delaying the start of Battlefield 6 Season 2.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s official subreddit, EA revealed that Season 2 for both Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC will now start on February 17. Originally, the next season was expected to begin on January 21.</p>







<p><strong>“During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qbv6tf/battlefield_6_and_redsec_season_1_january_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA said</a> in their statement.</p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2.</strong>“</p>







<p>With this delay, EA is giving players a new “Frostfire Bonus Path” starting on January 27. This new path includes new customization rewards along with XP boosts. Free rewards from the path include Hardware XP Boost, a Vehicle Skin and player card customization items. Those with the Battle Pass can get a new weapon package and career XP boost. </p>



<p><strong>“Unlike previous Bonus Paths, all Bonus Path Points for the Frostfire Bonus Path are earned through Weekly Challenges; there are no Bonus Challenges associated with this Bonus Path.,”</strong> EA says.</p>

<p><strong>Playoffs – Round One</strong></p>



<p>The first round of the playoffs will be a behind-closed-doors event, held between <strong>February 8 </strong>and <strong>February 10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs – Round Two</strong></p>



<p>The second round of the playoffs will run from <strong>February 13 </strong>to <strong>February 15 </strong>and will be played in front of a live audience in the Adidas Arena.</p>



<p>The playoffs will feature a double-elimination bracket with best-of-three match formats (except for the grand final, which is best-of-five).</p>

The update was previously expected to arrive sometime in late January.</p><p>Battlefield 6 had a strong start in October 2025 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">even outsold Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 in the US through November</a>. However, sentiment has somewhat shifted of late, with recent reviews on Steam shifting from "Mostly Positive" to "Mixed." Additionally, people have called out EA for pushing microtransactions and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-ai-generated-art-just-like-call-of-duty-fans-believe/1100-6537131/" data-ref-id="1100-6537131">the game's apparent use of generative AI. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what changes Battlefield Studios may make to the Season 2 content roadmap based on the community feedback mentioned in the statement. In fact, we don't yet have a rundown of what's in Season 2, but it's expected to bring more maps, guns, modes, and more.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/" data-ref-id="1100-6536874">reportedly less than $10 million</a>, a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a "AA"-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets.</p><p>"You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over. But I would not be able to live without a AAA title," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I really want to play the blockbuster games. You can't do GTA for $10 million. We need both."</p><p>Fares went on to say that "it's important not to get stuck in ideas." People should not allow themselves to be convinced that "AA is a new thing" or "indie is a new thing," he said.</p><p>"We need the diversity. I hope that publishers don't just look at a game like Expedition, which has been super successful, and think, 'Oh, AA is a new thing. Let's only do that.' I don't believe in that," he said.</p><p>Fares also reminded people that while Expedition 33 was a success, many other "AA" games were not. "You had a huge amount of AA games that came [in 2025], which nobody cared about. Let's remember that," he said.</p><p>The interviewer suggested to Fares that with higher budgets comes more risk-averse decision-making, as the money people want to have a return on investment and may opt for safer bets. Fares doesn't believe this is always the case, saying Naughty Dog is known for "pushing the envelope" with massive budgets, as are companies like Rockstar and Nintendo.</p><p>"So you can do a big AAA title but also take innovative risks," he said. "But once you go over a $100 million budget, you're going to be like, 'Okay, sh**. There's a lot of money on the table.' People are more scared. It's understandable. But it's proven that you can do it."</p><p>The budgets for Hazelight's games have grown over the years. Split Fiction had <a href="https://youtu.be/QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost double the budget</a> of It Takes Two, for example. Still, Hazelight's games are understood to fall within the AA category.</p><p>The creative director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Revelations, Alexadre Amancio, recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-games-future-lies-in-smaller-teams-says-ac-unity-director/1100-6537267/" data-ref-id="1100-6537267">AAA game development is broken</a> and problems cannot be solved by "throwing people at it." Instead, he said the future of AAA games might be in smaller teams.</p><p>Hazelight is working on a new game now, but it hasn't been announced as of yet. All of Hazelight's games so far have been co-op titles (Brothers was a single-player game with a unique co-op element). Fares said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fictions-josef-fares-has-already-started-next-game-clarifies-relationship-with-ea/1100-6530172/" data-ref-id="1100-6530172">co-op will always be part of Hazelight's DNA</a>, but he didn't rule out the possibility of the studio changing things up. "You never know what happens in the future. It's not impossible we look into single-player as well. But it would be done in a Hazelight way, with a Hazelight twist. It's not going to be your typical single-player game," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, Ubisoft made headlines when it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shut down its Halifax studio</a>, which not only put 71 developers out of a job, but those developers had just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-halifax-staff-officially-form-union">unionized two days prior</a>. Today, Ubisoft is continuing this trend by proposing to lay off even more people, this time at its subsidiaries Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">According to a statement provided to <em>IGN</em></a>, the restructuring would impact "approximately" 55 workers at the two Swedish studios, but the timeline of this restructuring is unclear. Ubisoft also claims that "the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged," and doesn't suggest that any ongoing projects, such as the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/21/ubisoft-announces-tom-clancys-the-division-3-appoints-new-series-producer">The Division 3</a>, will be impacted.</p><p>You can read the full statement provided to <em>IGN </em>below.</p><p>Earlier today, we informed all employees in our Swedish studios (Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm) about a proposed organizational restructure that may affect approximately 55 roles across Malmö and Stockholm," Ubisoft said in a statement passed to IGN today.&nbsp;</p><p>This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time.</p><p>These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.</p><p>The long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged, and we will continue to serve as the global home and lead for to The Division franchise, move forward with an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup, and play a central role in the development of Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>The proposed restructuring will begin with a focus on individual agreements and impacted employees are being informed directly and supported with care and respect inline with local regulations.</p><p>As noted in the statement, this news follows a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732?s=20">voluntary leave program at Massive that began last October</a>, allowing employees that might potentially be laid off to do so on their own terms. The announcement of further layoffs suggests Ubisoft wasn't satisfied with the number of people, if any, who took the offer.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4hSHqpDZ3g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Known for developing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora in 2023 and Star Wars: Outlaws in 2024, Massive has been one of Ubisoft's most prolific subsidiaries in recent years. All of this is on top of Massive's work developing and maintaining The Division 2, which had an expansion as recently as last year. Massive is currently in the midst of developing The Division 2: Survivors (an added survival extraction mode), The Division Resurgence (a mobile entry in the series), and The Division 3.</p><p>Last year, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">a similar layoff proposal at its subsidiary RedLynx</a>, known for the Trials series. Last March, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">it founded a new subsidiary in partnership with Tencent</a>, who owns a minority stake in the new company, to manage Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p><p>[<em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted"><em>IGN</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">BioWare's multiplayer shooter Anthem was terminated this week</a> because EA no longer wanted to maintain servers for people to play the game on, and without them, no one can play the game. But the former executive producer of Anthem has revealed that BioWare had technology working, close to the game's release, that would enable us to host our own servers to play the game on.</p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in December 2020, revealed the information at the end of a three-and-a-half hour video discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">"The Truth About What Happened on Anthem"</a>, which he posted on his YouTube channel. "Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months up to launch," he said. "I don't know that they still work but the code is there to be salvaged and recovered."</p>
<p>This in theory presents a possible lifeline and future for Anthem, and local server hosting is a crucial part of Darrah's even bolder plan for what could be done with Anthem now. His idea? To re-release the game as single-player and remove the multiplayer component entirely.</p>
<p>Darrah, an experienced executive producer, outlined a plan for doing this. You'd need a budget of about $10m, he said, and step one would be to bring the game up to date. This wouldn't be hard. Shift it to current-gen consoles and enable the top-end PC game effects, and lock it at 60 frames-per-second. Step two: local servers. Get rid of EA's need to host servers for the game. Step three: "Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Where players used to fill out groups in Anthem, you could instead have AI companions, as in other BioWare games. "And since this is BioWare," Darrah added, "go all the way into making them companions." You could use some existing characters for this and "promote" them, so to speak. "But I think you'll actually find there's a lower-friction route by making three-to-five new characters, with dialogue, with plot arcs, that are brand new to the series - that are people who'd go with you through the existing story of Anthem with their companion content," he said. "Writing those characters: not very difficult. Making those characters move with you: that's where a lot of the work is going to go."</p>
<p>What you'd have if you could do that is a game much more familiar to BioWare fans, Darrah said - people who potentially skipped Anthem because it was too looter-shooter for them. "What you've essentially re-engineered is a BioWare game," he said, "without romances, with a decent BioWare story, with companions, that can be played as a single-player game." You probably couldn't sell it for $70, he realises, but "for a pretty modest amount of work you could effectively create a brand new single-player game from what already exists for this game".</p>
<p>"Is EA going to do this?" he added. "Almost definitely not."</p>
<p>Darrah's full video covers a lot of ground, chronologically running through Anthem's development since conception in late 2011 or early 2012, through to release in 2019. It talks of the game's originating pitch as being a turning point in BioWare's history, and possibly the basis for all future live service problems to come. The video also highlights a project that crucially lacked a single unifying vision and identity - something ultimately born out in the finished game, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli pointed out in our Anthem review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gamestop-lawsuit-digital-goods-law-buy-vs-license/</link>
            <guid>1404700</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A GameStop customer, Jake Weber, is suing GameStop for alleged violations of California's digital goods transparency law. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2426&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>AB 2426</u></a>, which was signed in 2024 and went into effect in 2025, requires companies to let buyers know that they're not purchasing video games and other digital stuff outright, they're merely licensing them. It's why Valve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>changed its purchasing page</u></a> in 2024 to include a little note under the "Continue to payment" button: "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam."&nbsp;</p><p>Weber and his lawyers, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/980524033/GameStop-lawsuit-via-Aftermath?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in the proposed class action complaint filed Jan. 8 in California</u></a>, say GameStop doesn't do that. The important thing to know about this law is that it's not really changing the fact that a customer is licensing and not buying a game outright; it's just requiring that storefronts be upfront about this sort of thing, which has been an issue gamers have been rallying around for some time. As games age and player bases dwindle, game publishers may decide to stop supporting a video game. For older consoles, that's fine: The game you got on the cartridge is what the game is and always will be. But as the internet became more available, and online multiplayer and live service became a thing, there's a problem. If a publisher turns the servers off, people who purchased the game can't access it anymore.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is what happened when Ubisoft shut down <em>The Crew</em> in 2024. As an online-only game, people who purchased even the physical disc no longer had access. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/proposed-class-action-lawsuit-claims-the-crew-players-were-duped-bizarrely-comparing-the-game-shutting-down-to-ubisoft-breaking-into-your-house-and-stealing-parts-of-a-pinball-machine/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>A group of gamers sued Ubisoft in 2024 over it</u></a>—and the ensuing public outcry over the shutdown inspired the California law itself.</p><p>Weber's GameStop complaint outlines the situation with <em>The Crew</em> and the creation of California's Digital Property Rights Transparency Law. It also includes screenshots of the process of buying a digital game from GameStop, including the store page for <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>,&nbsp; the shopping cart, and checkout. Nowhere on the pages does GameStop note that players are buying a license and not the game itself, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>"At no point prior to the purchase is the consumer ever put on notice, in plain language, that the video game he is buying is just a license that can be revoked at any time," the lawyers write. "Nor is the consumer ever required to provide an affirmative acknowledgment that he or she knows the limited property rights he or she is receiving with the purchase of the digital video game."</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to GameStop for comment.</p><p>Weber and his lawyers are asking the court to grant the lawsuit class action status, so that other GameStop customers can join. It's also looking for a jury trial and damages for the impacted parties. Since the law went into effect in 2025, both <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/2428762/apple-hit-with-false-ad-suit-over-digital-content-sales?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a> and <a href="https://www.classaction.org/blog/amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-claims-customers-who-buy-content-are-misled-about-ownership-rights.?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amazon</u></a> have been sued for alleged violations. Both those lawsuits are ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at Ubisoft's <em>The Crew</em> lawsuit for any indication of how Weber's GameStop lawsuit may play out, there's not much to glean. Though the proposed class action suit garnered a lot of attention, it didn't even reach official class action status. (These lawsuits are filed as proposed class actions; a judge must determine that it meets several requirements.) The lawsuit <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.455496/gov.uscourts.caed.455496.23.0.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs</u></a> in June.</p><p>Regardless, the debacle of owning games versus licensing them will continue to be an issue as game developers and publishers stop supporting their old game servers. Electronic Arts and BioWare's online multiplayer shooter <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea/"><u><em>Anthem</em>, for instance, went offline on Jan. 12</u></a>. The issue is at the core of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Stop Killing Games initiative</u></a>, which self-describes as "a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." More transparency around buying versus licensing is good, but that's not what the Stop Killing Games movement wants—it wants publishers and developers to implement "end-of-life" plans for games, so that online-only games without support can still be run offline.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/high-on-life-2-leaked-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GGDYYH1V?tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">full Amazon page</a> for the Switch 2 version — complete with box art, price, and a release date of 20th April 2026 — popped up earlier today. It'll be a Game-Key Card release and you can even pre-order the game right now, despite the fact the port hasn't been officially announced.</p>
<p>It looks pretty official, though, and since the game is coming to other platforms on 13th February, even the two month wait seems believable.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ztmxvp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>If this is your first time hearing about High on Life 2, then let's fill you in via its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br>
You’ve done it. You’ve taken down an intergalactic cartel, brought humanity back from the brink of extinction, and hunted dangerous bounties to the far corners of the galaxy. Bounty hunting has brought you fortune, fame and love; but when a mysterious figure from your past reappears and puts a price on your sister’s head, your cushy life gets thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to risk it all and bring down an intergalactic conspiracy that once again threatens your favorite species (humans)?</p>
<p><em><strong>High On Life</strong></em> RETURNS as you and your beloved rag-tag team of alien misfits shoot, stab, and skate your way through gorgeous, dangerous worlds all across the galaxy to blow up the EVIL pharmaceutical conglomerate hell-bent on putting price tags on HUMAN LIFE!</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES<br></strong>- BLAST your way through enemies with an arsenal of charismatic alien firepower in high-octane hyperactive combat.<br>
- Kickflip alien cops in the face and grind your way to freedom with your brand new SKATEBOARD.<br>
- Get up close and personal with an eccentric cast of bizarre and subversive lifeforms voiced by an ALL-STAR COMEDY CAST.<br>
- Wreak havoc at the galaxy’s biggest convention, an alien zoo for humans, and a luxury futuristic cruiseliner on your cosmic quest to TAKE DOWN BIG PHARMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game is already available on Switch 1 &amp; 2, so a Switch 2 port makes sense for the sequel. We'll keep an eye out for an official announcement.</p>
<p>The original game was conceived by Justin Roiland, co-creator of <strong>Rick &amp; Morty</strong> who also founded developer Squanch Games in 2016, so that should give you an idea of the humour in this series. Roiland is not involved in the sequel, as in 2023, he stepped down as CEO of the company following charges of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>
<p>Our sister site Pure Xbox reviewed the original back when it released, and it's safe to say that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-for-pc/high-on-life">they didn't mince their words</a>. Let's hope the sequel is an improvement...</p>

<p>Besides supporting these other mods, <strong><em><a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/features">The Witcher Online</a></em></strong> features equipment sync thanks to which each players will be able to see their their equipped armor, swords, crossbow, scabbards, hair style, and face mark, full movement and combat sync corresponding to <strong>Geralt's</strong> animations, emotes that other players can see using corresponding emote commands in the console, statuses display and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/</link>
            <guid>1404676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hazelight Studios</strong> has made a name for itself by creating excellent couch co-op games, with the team's latest release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong>, being one of 2025's best games, earning it several nominations at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a>,</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It was even one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Wccftech's picks for our Best Games of 2025</a>, and according to the studio's creative director, <strong>Josef Fares</strong>, the studio's next game will be "<em>better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>This comes from a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>, where Fares talked about a lot more than just what he expects from the studio's next game. He talked about how the team at Hazelight is consistently raising its bar, which is why he added, "<em>I feel extremely confident of everything we’re doing. I can easily say that our next game is better than Split Fiction</em>."</p>



<p>That confidence comes from the culture that has been built at the studio since its debut game, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Hazelight currently stands at a team of <strong>80 people</strong>, and keeping as much of that team together since its founding has been a key part of the studio's success, as they've all grown together with Josef Fares leading the charge with his "<em>F*** s*** up mentality, without f***ing up</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Split Fiction’s Josef Fares on Clair Obscur success, AI fears and EA’s reputation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9WyRvP53_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hazelight's games are known for being creatively supercharged, which Fares credits to his ability to "<em>wake up the creative monster</em>" inside the developers at Hazelight. A task easier said than done, though, as we're often the ones to get in our own way.</p>



<p>"<em>People put a lot of limitations on themselves, and it’s mainly coming from their mind</em>. <em>Once you stop listening to that, shit will start happening. And how do you do it? Well, first, you practically push that person… in a nice way, obviously. You say, ‘not this’, ‘let’s do that’. ‘that’s been done before, let’s try this way’. And eventually they come into this ‘f*** s*** up’ mentality where they’re like, ‘okay, there are no limits’. And then you make that person feel confident that there really are no limits. People have so many possibilities inside them, and that’s not only for creating games, but in general. It’s just, stop listening to this [points to head] and just feel it instead.</em>"</p>



<p>Fares also discussed how the studio has had incredible commercial successes. Split Fiction <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">sold <strong>4 million copies at launch</strong></a>, and its prior release, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two</a>,</strong> sold over <strong><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies as of March 2025</a>.</strong> But those numbers weren't achieved with the studio following trends or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/">put microtransactions into everything.</a> It came from the team at Hazelight keeping what's best for the game at the heart of all its decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>Every decision, every single decision, taken by Hazelight will be based on what we feel is great for the game. We’re not going through data thinking what will sell or not sell. That’s not how we do it. I’m not saying that the business is not important. It’s important to combine them together. If you lean in too much on either side, either too much on creativity or too much on business, it’s going to be bad for the game</em>."</p>



<p>On the topic of following trends, Fares also spared a few words on the hottest topic in the industry, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?wp_searchable_posts%5Bquery%5D=genAI">GenAI</a>. </strong>"<em>We have been working with AI for a long time in game development. The problem is the generative AI</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>If [an AI tool] is helpful to get your vision out there, I don’t see why we shouldn’t look into it. But… it’s the generative AI that people are a bit like…It’s really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn’t gone up much. Maybe this is the limit of it.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>You get someone generating a game concept and saying, ‘oh look what might happen in five years?’ But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better</em>. <em>At the end of the day, you still need someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is. I don’t see AI taking over. I don’t. But it’s really hard to answer. Who knows what happens in the future?</em>"</p>

<p>According to GI.biz, the aforementioned voluntary redundancy program "had some takeup", but Ubisoft deemed "additional steps" were necessary in order to further cut costs.</p><p>An internal email sent by Ubisoft to staffers apparently states that the layoffs are nothing to do with staff performance and that the direction of both studios remains the same.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Massive Entertainment is the studio behind 2024's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-outlaws" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdd3085d-9457-4fdd-8120-72f7ba52b3c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, and it's also the developer responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d6d339e-943d-4392-8a44-bd5f8ec47fda" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em> </em>and the <em>Division </em>franchise.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>'s early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-release-time-and-date">went live a short time ago</a> as I write this. While plenty of folks look to have gotten in already, its devs have issued some guidance for the many others who've reported running into error messages or having their downloads stick.</p>
<p>The team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme who've swiftly resurrected the Minecraft-esque sandbox after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights from Riot Games</a> had predicted launch day might see some teething troubles due to a bottleneck of eager Hytalers, and it certainly seems those concerns weren't misplaced.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While some of the errors folks have run into early doors trying to get into Hytale have been at the point of purchase - here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-error-a-basket-with-that-identifier-does-not-exist-fix">handy guide on how to deal with at least one of those</a> - a bunch of reported having things go pear-shaped while trying to download the game via its launcher.</p>
<p>Cue a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/523059903812599811/551337246364532737">Discord server</a> full of people spamming error messages. So far the Hypixel team are working on fixes, but the main bit of advice at this early stage is simple. "If you are seeing launcher downloads being stuck / error. Please restart the launcher," Hytale tech director Slikey has posted. "Global distribution is still rolling, so you may need to keep trying."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you are seeing really weird stuff, please reply to me.</p>— Slikey (@slikey) <a href="https://twitter.com/slikey/status/2011095876270203181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, folks with "really weird stuff " are being encouraged to reply to his tweet. While Hytale's Discord server doesn't appear to have a dedicated channel for those seeking help solving issues or getting advice on fixing bugs, its general game discussion channel has seen a bunch of posting to that effect in the past hour or so.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you're able, I'd give it an hour or two to settle down before trying to hop in if you're keen not to spend time having tech doors potentially slam in your face. Maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-doom-running-in-hytale-before-its-even-out-thanks-to-modders">watch a modder play Doom in Hytale</a> on repeat if that helps. We also have a guide to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">installing the latter on the Steam Deck</a> if you need such a thing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[We Finally Have Good Art Of All The Pokémon Legends: Z-A Megas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297</link>
            <guid>1404658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak’s established promotional pipeline for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games has the company using 3D renders, rather than hand-drawn art, to reveal new monsters ahead of each game’s launch. Anyone who cares about getting good assets of these new critters knows that this is the purgatory The Pokémon Company puts us through as we wait for the gorgeous illustrations we’ll get post-release, which resemble the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>old Ken Sugimori art</span></a><span> that you see featured on database sites like </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Raichu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"><span>Bulbapedia</span></a><span>. Today, January 13, we finally got the art drop for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> and its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>DLC. And oh boy, there’s some beauts here.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the art is of the several dozen new Mega Evolutions added in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and its expansion, but it also includes official artwork of some of the major characters who show up later in the game and weren’t part of the initial marketing push. Notably, this includes Lysandre, Grisham, and Griselle, ex-members of the villainous Team Flare, some of the only truly “secret” characters who are crucial to some of the late game reveals. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443"><span>Lysandre</span></a><span> in particular was kept under wraps, given he was long presumed dead after the events of </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. I suppose The Pokémon Company is ripping that bandage off. You had three months to play the game, so the aged, immortal version of Lysandre we get in </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>might start showing up in more marketing material now that he’s being acknowledged through official channels.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the real treat is the good art we finally have of all the Mega Evolutions, including my boy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu X</span></a><span>, the meme king </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, and some of the lesser-known transformations that debuted in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Click through to see them all.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, The Pokémon Company announced the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713"><span>official Pokémon x Lego collaboration models</span></a><span>, including sets for Pikachu, Eevee, and a disgustingly expensive one of the Kanto starters. If you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>compare them to the Mega Bloks models</span></a><span>, though, you might decide to buy those cheaper sets instead.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-xbox-storage-expansion-card-drops-below-0-12-per-gb-at-a-new-year-record-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-ssd-2000656513</link>
            <guid>1404652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="1023">Gaming has a file size problem. In recent years, we’ve seen video games reach overwhelmingly large sizes. This is particularly true for many big-budget games developed by Western AAA studios. Take <em data-start="286" data-end="308">Oblivion: Remastered</em>, for example, which has a file size of over 120GB. It’s hard to even imagine how much space <em data-start="401" data-end="422">Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will occupy when it’s eventually released. With games consuming such vast amounts of storage, it’s a challenge for players—especially since consoles like the Xbox Series X still come with only 1TB of internal storage. If you want to play more than just a few games, you’ll find yourself constantly managing space by deleting and reinstalling titles, which isn’t exactly convenient. A far better solution is to invest in a dedicated external storage drive. Seagate offers one that’s made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Series S, and it’s currently available at a significant discount for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1395"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon is offering three versions of Seagate’s Xbox expansion card at reduced prices right now</a>. The 1TB model, typically priced at $160, is on sale for $149, giving you a $11 discount. The 2TB version has dropped from $260 to $230, saving you $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1397" data-end="1743">Since the Xbox Series X comes with just 1TB of storage, adding one of these Seagate drives will either double, triple, or even quintuple your available space for Xbox games—depending on which model you choose. This extra storage will make a huge difference if you want to keep a variety of games installed without constantly managing your space.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Installing the Seagate expansion card is incredibly simple. Unlike the PS5, which requires users to open the console casing to install an SSD, the Seagate drive for Xbox Series X and S plugs directly into a dedicated slot at the back of the console. No tools are needed. Once it’s plugged in, you can select whether you want to save new games to the internal storage or to your Seagate expansion card.</p>


<h2 data-start="1745" data-end="2146">Swap Between Games With Ease</h2>
<p data-start="2148" data-end="2610">What’s more, games saved to the Seagate drive perform just as well as those stored on your Xbox’s internal storage. A major selling point of the current generation of Xbox consoles is Quick Resume, which allows you to suspend one game and switch to another without losing your progress. You can jump from a high-speed race in <em data-start="2495" data-end="2512">Forza Horizon 5</em> to a quick match in <em data-start="2533" data-end="2548">Rocket League</em>, then return to your original&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>race right where you left off.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Seagate’s expansion cards are officially licensed to support Xbox’s Velocity Architecture, which powers Quick Resume. This means any game you store on the Seagate drive will benefit from Quick Resume, just like games stored on the internal drive. Whether you’re downloading a new title or moving an existing one, the experience will remain seamless and efficient.</p>
<p data-start="2612" data-end="2975" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With lots of massive titles set to release this year such as <em>GTA VI</em> and <em>007 First Light</em>, now is a great time to expand your Xbox storage. Grab Seagate’s Xbox expansion card for as little as $160 for a limited time.</p>

            <p>Before 2026 heats up, we've got several small and mid-sized game releases coming our way fast, but unexpected arrivals like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> could be making the coming weeks busier than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has just unveiled a new 'combat deep dive' trailer (which you can watch below) and locked a February 18 launch for the game, which is now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> too. As for the price tag, it's targeting $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, with a Deluxe Edition adding "five additional missions, two new recruitable heroes, and three new technologies" at $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99.</p>

<a aria-label="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7K9_Kn6fvEU?autoplay=1" title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Combat Deep Dive">

<p>Trapping the full experience behind the Deluxe Edition aside, this "story-driven survival strategy game" has been looking refreshing ever since it was first announced. Strategy games, narrative journeys, and survival experiences are all common nowadays, but it's stranger to see them all come together while using a famous sci-fi property to boot.</p><p>In many ways, Across the Unknown is taking cues from older Star Trek games that had players taking command of starships and entire crews, and that applies to the combat as seen in this trailer (surprisingly involved if you ask me). That said, the bigger scope and focus on what-if scenarios could set it apart from past strategy games set in the iconic universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full gameplay loop appears to be quite varied; players can expect scenes which are all about decision-making as well as exploration, management, research, and combat. For each section, <a href="https://www.gamexcite.de/">Gamexcite</a> has leaned on systems and mechanics which look familiar; hopefully, the final result will please trekkies and the more casual crowd alike.</p>
<p>Though the game seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch 2's handheld mode given its chill and menu-heavy rhythm, don't forget it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S too. In fact, those platforms have received a demo you can check out before purchasing.</p>

            <p>Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting bugs. Or so will say the folks who don the gear of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s next warbond. It's dubbed Redacted Regiment and it's all about looking stealthy in a tactical fashion. As opposed to simply trying to hide in a corner because you're a coward, as I've unashamedly done numerous times while serving Super Earth.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491587748125214428">next gear pack</a> for the shooter's set to arrive on January 20th, and marks the first proper new addition its gotten since the calendar flipped over in 2026. So, what sort of kit is it delivering in return for hard-earned super credits? Well, in two words, sneaky shit.</p>
<p>Both of its primary weapons - the R-72 Censor and AR-59 Suppressor - are rifles with integrated quietening tech. I mean the latter's literally named after said quietening tech, so you probably guessed that. The Censor's aimed at taking down targets at medium range, while the Suppressor has a longer reach. The armour sets which accompany these armaments are similarly sneaky. The RS-89 Shadow Paragon set's your standard light tactical infiltrator getup, complete with 15 million pockets, while the RS–67 Null Cipher set provides medium protection thanks to angular metal planting designed to ditch radar detection.</p><p>They come with a "Concealed Insertion" booster, which whacks up a smoke screen to emerge through when your hellpod touches down, completing the hushed hitman ensemble. Rounding things out are a sidearm in the P-35 Re-Educator pistol, which shoots dart that make enemies delirious. Then, there are a couple of explodey things in the form of a backpack full of C4 as a stratagem and a mine which lures foes to it before enboomening.</p>
<p>It all looks decently fun, but I'd say it's a bit too dry to mirror the wackier warbonds which I reckon are where Helldivers 2's slapstick shootery really shines. No <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">wormhole teleportation packs</a> to be seen here, though I suppose if every set of new gear had one, it wouldn't be as special.</p>
<p>Odds seem good that once this warbond's live, Arrowhead might start cracking into whatever regimen of new battle scenarios or galactic threats they have planned for the game's unending war this year. Things have been fairly quiet since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">Into the Unjust update</a> and subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-install-size-reduction-effort-yields-131gb-in-cuts-and-you-can-try-the-slim-build-right-now">technical tweaks</a>, so it feels like Super Earth's finest are due having another big twist flung their way soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Prime Docking Station (14-Port, 160W) Crashes to Lowest Price of the Year, Now Cheaper Than During Last Holidays]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-prime-docking-station-14-port-160w-crashes-to-lowest-price-of-the-year-now-cheaper-than-during-last-holidays-2000659243</link>
            <guid>1404604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anker’s Prime Docking Station is a 14-port hub that can power your laptop and accessories and drive dual monitors from a very small footprint. It comes in a sleek, vertically oriented case that can be placed on your desk. Up front, it has ports for charging your devices, and on the back side, ports for data, video, and networking access. There is also a small LED screen that shows which ports are currently active and how power is being distributed. The device can handle both power and data transfer simultaneously, with a maximum of 160W of power distribution and 10 Gbps of data speed, making it a powerful tool for organizing your various accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Click here to purchase the Anker Prime Docking Station for $170 on Amazon, discounted from its regular retail price of $270. This is a savings of $100, or 37% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A quick and easy way to perform cable management with all your devices</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station includes four USB-C ports, five USB-A ports, dual HDMI ports, an Ethernet jack, and audio jacks. The two USB-C ports on the front of the dock can deliver up to 160W of power and charge up to two devices simultaneously. Each port can provide up to 100W to a single compatible laptop, allowing you to charge your laptop while working. The rear USB-C and USB-A data ports support transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, enabling faster transfers of large files between external storage devices and your computer. Since all your peripherals are attached to the docking station via a single upstream USB-C connection, you don’t have to unplug any peripherals when you disconnect your laptop.</p>



<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station features dual HDMI outputs for connecting multiple external monitors to your laptop. For example, you can connect two separate 4K monitors at 60 Hz, giving you ample space to spread out multiple applications across both. Alternatively, if you prefer a simple layout, you can connect a single monitor and still have the second HDMI port available for a television or projector.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station is compatible with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt laptops that support DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB-C Power Delivery, including but not limited to: many Windows 10, Windows 11, and Chrome OS laptops. Mac laptops can also use the dock; however, the two external monitors will mirror each other instead of providing a traditional three-monitor desktop environment. Note that the dock is not compatible with Linux laptops, and some gaming laptops may require their own chargers to operate at optimal levels. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">At a discounted price of $170, down from $270, the Anker Prime Docking Station is an effective way to convert a single USB-C port into a powered 14-port desktop configuration.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Given the very loud fallout from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>series finale</span></a><span> and a portion of the horror show’s fandom descending into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>a mass hysteria</span></a><span> in believing that a secret ninth episode </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>might fix the whole season</span></a><span>, I have to wonder if there were any conversations at Netflix about not releasing the </span><i><span>One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5 </span></i><span>documentary that went live on the streaming service yesterday, January 12. Already, every word that series creators the Duffer Brothers had been uttering in interviews </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>was being picked apart</span></a><span>, and now the conspiratorial mindset fueling that scrutiny has been given a lot of new wood to burn by the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>The two-hour documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage of the writers’ room and table readings, as well as the set of the show during shooting. In a world where </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>hadn’t been combed through by fans looking for any proof that a secret episode was coming, it could have been viewed as a surprisingly honest look at all the moving parts a production of this scale has to contend with. But there’s a segment of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans looking for any explanation as to how it all went wrong, and the documentary sure has a few moments that fans are latching onto.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the things people are pointing out are mostly speculative. In one section, the Duffer Brothers are shown with what fans believe to be </span><a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/2010896631034707994"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2010679300282871909"><span>Reddit tabs</span></a><span> open on a computer while writing the script for a season five episode. The Reddit logo is pretty clear in one shot, but the ChatGPT one is more contested. Even so, these tabs being open doesn’t actually confirm anything, but detractors are running around with accusations that the Duffers used ChatGPT or relied on fan discussions on Reddit when making important creative decisions, all based on…open tabs? Let’s be serious.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>As for more substantial stuff, a few scenes in the documentary have caught the eye of people critical of the season, and more specifically, of the Duffer Brothers. At one point during filming of the finale, Montana Maniscalco, the key production assistant on the show, says that the episode isn’t completely written yet, with the presumptive takeaway being that the Duffer Brothers must still be trying to figure out how the season is going to end this late into production.</span></p>

   <p><span>Other scenes of note include a moment in the writers’ room in which writer Paul Dichter said that there should be more monsters in the finale’s climactic battle, even going so far as to name the Demogorgon from season one as a potential foe for the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>crew to face in the final fight. He says it would be “crazy” if there was nothing there. Well, if you saw the finale, you know that’s exactly what happened, and it seems Dichter’s feedback was “ignored.”</span></p>

   <p><span>In another clip, Maya Hawke is seen discussing a moment her character shares with her girlfriend Vickie. Their relationship is a secret at this point in the story, and we see Hawke is saying she wants to have this conversation “in a whisper.” This, too, is being read in the most bad faith way, with the narrative being that Hawke is having to “remind” the crew about things the writers “forgot” about characters, rather than actors sharing ideas on how things should be played because they’re a part of this process, too, and might have opinions.</span></p>

   <p><span>I don’t mean to be dismissive of people who didn’t like the ending, but I have “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asthkXjWWQ0"><span>played these games before</span></a><span>.” I know what it’s like to be searching for any justification for your disappointment and projecting narratives onto some pretty normal interactions in a creative space. I can’t speak for why they ignored Dichter’s note about the monsters, but Hawke’s point about tweaking that scene? That shit happens all the time in movies and TV. We had this same conversation when James Gunn and David Corenswet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auz1txQ5WVc"><span>had a debate about some lines in the </span><i><span>Superman </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. People reacted to it as if it was a “fight,” but this is literally just something that happens when you’re collaborating with someone else on a creative project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know the confirmation bias is too embedded in the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fandom right now, with people still holding out hope that there’s another finale locked away in a vault somewhere waiting to fix everything. Y’all can keep fighting ghosts, but I do hope that the people who are still caught up in this conspiratorial cycle find their way out of it.</span></p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a new Warbond called Redacted Regiment on January 20, 2026; here’s what you need to know about it. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios is back again with a new Warbond for players to try out. The last few Premium Warbonds saw developers introduce features such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2s-next-premium-warbond-will-introduce-a-minigun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minigun</a>, the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killzone collaboration</a>, and more. The latest Premium Warbond will focus on suppression technology and spec ops fashions. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Weapons and Stratagems</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Premium Warbond will introduce two primary weapons for players to try out. The first is a mid-range precision rifle with an integrated suppressor called R-72 Censor. The other is a fully automatic assault rifle with a non-removable suppressor called AR-59 Suppressor. There’s also a dart-firing P-35 Re-Educator, which releases “a chemical agent that induces delirium in organic targets and delirium-like malfunction in inorganic ones.”</p>



<p>Coming to the Stratagems, first up is the B/MD C4 Pack, a backpack that comes with six adhesive C4 charges and a wireless detonator. The other is the TM-01 Lure Mine, a throwable anti-personnel mine that attracts enemies by producing sounds and flashing lights. The mine will detonate when the target enters its proximity. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-cosmetics">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Cosmetics</h2>



<p>First up are the Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment, and players get two of them this time. First up is RS-89 Shadow Paragon light armor, which comes with “multitudinous pads and pouches to hold all your tactical EDC items”. The other is the RS–67 Null Cipher medium armor, which has been coated with “a radar-absorbent polymer and null-signature heat baffle to turn you into a real sensor ghost.” Both armours feature Reduced Signature passive, which results in reducing the player’s noise level and also the range the enemy can detect them in. </p>



<p>There are two new capes as well, the Pillar of the Abyss and Triangulation Veil capes. Additionally, a new victory post called Target Sighted and a new player title, [Redacted], have been added as well. Lastly, there’s a new booster called Concealed Insertion, which deploys a smokescreen from your Hellpod in impact, allowing you to enter stealth mode as soon as you land. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has addressed the long wait for Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe, insisting that Amazon is in control of the delivery of the adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Superman actor and Warhammer 40,000 lover Henry Cavill is set to star in and executive produce the live-action Warhammer 40,000 adaptation for Prime Video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe is shrouded in mystery, and Games Workshop itself has cautioned fans not to expect to see anything of it for some time. But it is now over three years since Games Workshop’s deal with Amazon was announced, and fans have yet to see anything of it, or hear anything tangible about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its latest financial results (the long and short of it is that Games Workshop is doing tremendously well and making loads of money), CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the elephant in the room: just what is going on with the Amazon stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We continue to work on some exciting projects that will bring Warhammer to screens like never before,” Rountree said, keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our live action endeavour is still in development with our partners: Amazon MGM Studios, Henry Cavill and Vertigo. It is the nature of these things to take several years, and while we wish we could tie down a release the way we can with our core business, the reality is that, as with any licensing deal, delivery is not in our control. We leave it to our partners to manage their own businesses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t help fans much, to be honest. But at least we know the project is still in the works and hasn’t been lost to the Warp. Fans have spent the last few years in a state of enduring excitement about the prospect of finally seeing Warhammer 40,000 brought to life in live-action form across films and TV shows — and with Cavill steering the ship, they’re confident it will be done right. Hopefully we'll get some details, including who Cavill himself will play, soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, condensing the vast scope of Warhammer 40,000 into films and TV shows while sticking to a reasonable budget may prove a challenge. Warhammer 40,000 is a highly detailed setting with multiple factions, thousands of years of war played out on a galactic scale, and, at the heart of it all, enormous Space Marines who often fight against even bigger monsters. We’re talking space battles that can last hundreds of years, gargantuan land battles that can consume entire planets, and the Warp, a place so unknowable that it can be pretty much anything you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that context, what story will Cavill tell? Does it need to be more grounded than a big galactic epic? We’re left with scraps to mull over, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be"><u>recent comments from Dan Abnett about NDAs and upcoming books</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-hes-enjoying-the-challenge-of-creating-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-it-is-a-tricky-ip-and-a-very-complex-ip-and-thats-what-i-love-about-it"><u>Cavill himself touched on the “complexity” and “trickiness” of adapting the Warhammer 40,000 IP</u></a>. But, he insisted, he’s loving the challenge, which for fans will be great to hear. Bringing Warhammer to life "is a dream come true," Cavill said, "but it's different from what I've done before, in the sense I haven't had my hand on the tiller of things before. It's wonderful doing that. It is a tricky IP, and a very complex IP, and that's what I love about it. The challenges that come with putting this on the page in a way that is doing justice to that complexity, that trickiness, and that nuance, is a challenge I'm enjoying enormously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Rountree did have one solid bit of news to deliver: a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode is in the works. Age of Sigmar is the fantasy portion of the Warhammer universe, as opposed to Warhammer 40,000's far future setting. This new episode follows on from the hugely popular Warhammer 40,000 episode for Amazon’s animated anthology series Secret Level, which starred Titus from Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like there’s more to come from a potential Secret Level Season 2. “After a successful collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios and Blur for Secret Level (a high-end animated anthology show), we are now meeting with writers to determine our next step to continue the momentum gained from that episode,” Rountree said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the meantime, work is almost complete on a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode. Again, for Prime Video. We will update you further when we have more significant milestones to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. Its core business is selling miniatures and box sets that are used by fans to play these games, but there are a number of other creative aspects of the hobby that Games Workshop invests in, such as book selling, art sales, and animation production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">Displate was forced to deny that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI</a>, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253-1768309174083.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.
