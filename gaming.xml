            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161071/doctor-who-steven-moffat-boom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="78nCF5">You could probably consider it a law, like gravity: Any popular entertainment fortunate enough to amass a fandom will eventually find said fandom at odds with at least some of its creative team. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-trek">Star Trek</a> probably invented it (what the hell, it’s invented every other <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033366/star-trek-sexiest-episodes-ranked">modern pop culture quirk</a>), but most every fanbase has experienced it. In the realm of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/10/5/17938178/doctor-who-tardis-black-fans">21st-century <em>Doctor Who </em>fandom</a> specifically, this nexus of passion and ire is centered around writer Steven Moffat.</p>
<p id="Jz8fPz">Mostly known at the time for the BBC sitcom <em>Coupling</em>, Moffat very quickly began to establish a reputation as one of the most exciting writers working under then-showrunner Russel T. Davies’ 2005 revival of <em>Doctor Who</em>, a guy who would drop in every season for a standalone episode or two-parter that reliably brought the house down. When Moffat took over as <em>Who </em>showrunner in series 5, at the start of Matt Smith’s tenure as the Eleventh Doctor, it didn’t seem like there was a better pick. </p>
<p id="0uPsqG">The grass is always greener though, and while the man responsible for two-thirds of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/5/18127351/tumblr-ban-content-memes-community">SuperWhoLock era of internet fandom</a> had amassed a zealous following, he had a rockier go of it as the man in charge. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23172599/steven-moffat-tv-doctor-who-sherlock">Moffat fell out of favor</a> as audiences tired of his recklessly plotty vision and smug voice, and <em>Doctor Who</em> entered a fallow period — only to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979689/doctor-who-the-star-beast-review">brought to vibrant life by Davies once again</a>. And so an old dynamic re-asserts itself, 20 years later, with Russel T. Davies steering the ship, and — surprise — Steven Moffat back as his ringer. </p>

<p id="EW93Iu">“Boom,” the third episode (fourth if you count <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24016644/doctor-who-christmas-special-review">the Christmas special</a>, which Disney Plus does) of the Davies 2.0 era of <em>Doctor Who </em>is such a return to form for Moffat that it is genuinely astounding. With the exception of a brief prologue, “Boom” is a bottle episode in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-club-33-movie-darren-lemke-shawn-levy-1235904632/">the truest sense of the word</a>, taking place on one set and revolving around a very simple problem: The Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) has stepped on a sci-fi landmine on an alien world and cannot move without setting it off. </p>
<p id="hKiPvA">What makes “Boom” such a gripping hour of television is the way that it takes its premise and adds layer after layer of thematic and dramatic tension, loading its dilemma with nigh-unbearable levels of stress. The planet the Doctor and companion Ruby Sunday are visiting? It’s embroiled in a never-ending war. The soldiers are Anglican Marines, a faction of religious soldiers <em>Who</em> fans will remember from Moffat’s tenure as showrunner. They will never stop fighting, even if they don’t know why, and there’s <em>definitely</em> reason to doubt why. A girl’s father goes missing, and she thinks the Doctor knows where — whoops, now that’s a life imperiled, because she doesn’t realize the Doctor’s predicament. Making matters even <em>worse </em>is a small fleet of AI-piloted robots designed by an arms manufacturer to keep the battle running smoothly and <em>profitably</em>. </p>
<p id="gQwAhO">In “Boom,” Moffat’s long-established tics — showy, caustic dialog and an inclination towards sentiment — are once again strengths here. Like a lot of the best <em>Who</em> writers, Moffat understands that the Doctor feels most special not when he’s merely being smart, but when he’s <em>communicating</em>; when he’s talking his way out of trouble by showing empathy, not just by being clever. In Moffat’s worst moments of excess, this results in a Doctor that is self-satisfied at being the cleverest in the room, arrogant in his own intellect. At his best though, in the hands of a talented, emotive actor like Ncuti Gatwa? It’s remarkable theater, as a man desperately tries to connect with people who have no reason to listen to him, who have been <em>conditioned</em> against everything he might have to say. </p>
<p id="NttD3F">And, of course, there’s a bit of classic Moffat devilishness to the affair, a joke and a dare in the episode’s very premise: An alien who can travel to all of time and space, stuck in one spot. Will we still watch? </p>

The base Hero Mastery mode, which creates hero-specific obstacle courses that have been rolling out in waves since September, will continue, with more hero courses expected in future seasons. The full message reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As we prepare for Season 11, we’ve taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played. Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn’t resonated with players in the ways that we hoped. With this in mind, we have decided to discontinue Hero Mastery Gauntlet as a permanent mode, and it will not be available to play starting in Season 11.</p><p>Players have until the end of Season 10 to complete the Lifetime Challenges for Hero Mastery Gauntlet and compete on the mode’s Top 500 leaderboards.</p><p>Thanks to all of you who jumped into the Gauntlet.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-claims-on-what-%E2%80%9Cxbox-on-every-screen%E2%80%9D-means.878286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-claims-on-what-xbox-on-every-screen-means/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>For the past few months and years, Microsoft has been talking a lot about bringing Xbox to “every screen”. While details on that remain both scarce and confusing, a new claim from journalist Jez Corden of Windows Central gives a bit of insight into what they looks like.</p>



<p>In speaking on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93N7Uu3-9s&amp;t=5409s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden spoke about what he’s heard about the cocept.</p>



<p>“I actually have some details on exactly what Xbox on every screen looks like now,” he said. “And I think what it is, is that every Xbox game will have a consistent social UI across all the games, so like if you’re playing Sea of Thieves, for example, on the PlayStation, you will be able to bring up a mini Xbox guide, or something like that. Kind of like Battlenet, sort of.”</p>



<p>Corden then added that it’s at the point in development that it has a codename within Xbox called Roseway.</p>



<p>Obviously this is likely just a small part of Microsoft’s larger plan for an “Xbox on every screen”. The company is still working on next-gen hardware, a possible handheld device, and even improvements to its cloud gaming offering.</p>

            <p>
Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has a new CEO.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, it was announced that Shams Jorjani - who was previously part of the team that published Arrowhead's game, Magicka - will take over the leadership role at the company, replacing founder Johan Pilestedt. 
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt will remain in a leadership position following this change, and will now serve as Arrowhead's chief creative officer and chairman.

<p>
"We were both at a stage where we're wondering what's next in our careers," Jorjani told Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">GamesIndustry.biz</a> today. "And we realised we probably couldn't quite get to those places if we didn't have the other one to help us get there."
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt added: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how we are going to take Arrowhead into the future."
</p>
<p>
The pair likened themselves to Frodo and Sam from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy making their way to Mordor. "The oblivious approach of 'we'll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come'," Pilestedt said, adding the "strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other".

<p>
Elsewhere in the conversation, the duo also touched on any potential acquisitions following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">the huge success of Helldivers 2</a>. For now, the plan is for Arrowhead to remain an independent studio. "I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard," Pilestedt said. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, while the focus for the team remains on Helldivers 2 for now, Arrowhead is also looking to the future and what may come next. 
</p>
<p>
"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt shared. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani added Arrowhead's goal is to "make really great co-op games", and ultimately turn the company into a "flagship studio, where people who want to make these kinds-of games say to themselves: 'I want to work at Arrowhead'". 
</p>
<p>
The newly-appointed CEO stated this does not mean the studio will suddenly begin employing 500+ members of staff. "We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself," he said. "We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."
</p>
<p>
"We don't run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist," Pilestedt closed.
</p>

</p>
<p>
"We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches," Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard explained on Discord. "We feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios has appointed a new CEO, but don't worry; former CEO Johan Pilestedt isn't going anywhere.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, ex-Paradox and Hooded Horse exec Shams Jorjani will step into the CEO role at Arrowhead, while Pilestedt will remain the studio's CCO (chief creative officer) and chairman.</p>

<p>Pilestedt says that appointing a new CEO will allow him to focus more on the creative side of game development. He says that having a "reluctant CEO" at the head of Arrowhead would not "turn out that well", and that this decision was made "for the success of the business but also myself".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=0eLEkLek 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=mZCkFcpU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a new CEO in town at&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>studio Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as looking after the health of Arrowhead, it's possible that Pilestedt's decision to appoint a new CEO was inspired partially by the recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PlayStation ID controversy.</p>

<p>If you missed out on that, here's a quick refresher. When&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>launched on PC, it was originally intended to require a PlayStation ID linked to your Steam account to play, but that requirement was temporarily postponed owing to technical problems.</p>

<p>After a few months, it was announced that Arrowhead and Sony would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">once again</a> require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PC players to have a PlayStation ID to play, and the community responded with outrage and fury, review bombing the game on Steam in droves.</p>

<p>The requirement was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">eventually rescinded</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s user reviews returned to normal, but not before&nbsp;the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">delisted in a number of countries</a> that don't allow PSN accounts to be created.</p>

<p>It's possible this incident contributed to spooking Pilestedt into dealing with the appointment of a new CEO sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Despite that, Jorjani says he doesn't want Arrowhead to be a "500-person company", describing that possibility as "quite painful in a lot of ways".</p>

<p>Instead, Jorjani says he wants growth at Arrowhead to be "a means to an end" and says the studio has no plans to go public. Pilestedt adds that the Arrowhead team isn't running the studio for profit, but "the desire to just make great games".</p>

  <p id="LuZ4Jq">Who is <em>IF </em>for? Looking at any of the film’s marketing or the trailer, the answer seems easy: kids. But after seeing <em>IF</em>, written and directed by John Krasinski (a considerable departure from his <em>A Quiet Place</em> movies), that answer stops seeming so simple. This “family comedy” isn’t particularly family-friendly, or particularly comedic. There are, at most, a handful of lines resembling jokes. Judging by the restlessness of the children in my screening, it isn’t for them at all.</p>
<p id="Jh5cyU"><em>IF </em>feels more like a film targeted at millennial parents: It’s overflowing with symbols of millennial childhood. Characters listen to music on cherished vinyl records, and tap into their memories not on iPhones, but on old video cameras. Cellphones aren’t part of this world. Everything from the carnival rides to the furniture seems to come from the 1990s. </p>
<p id="6G0D6u">Plot-wise, that focus on millennial nostalgia makes sense. <em>IF</em> centers on 12-year-old Bea (Cailey Fleming), who recently lost her mother, and may soon lose her father (John Krasinski) as well: He’s about to have heart surgery. Bea discovers she and her neighbor Cal (Ryan Reynolds) can see other people’s abandoned imaginary friends, and they launch a quest to reunite these “IF”s with the kids who imagined them, in order to keep the IFs – and people’s imaginations — alive. </p>

<p id="QDba6t"><em>IF </em>is all about how comforting and wonderful nostalgia is. This is an extremely familiar theme in current culture. Marketing trends have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfriedman/2016/08/02/why-nostalgia-marketing-works-so-well-with-millennials-and-how-your-brand-can-benefit/?sh=5007b5ba3636">pushing the nostalgia agenda</a>. The same thing is happening in pop culture, with popular ’80s and ’90s films and shows from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22280848/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-curse-of-the-shadows-review"><em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Rugrats</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645071/oscars-2023-avatar-the-way-of-water-top-gun-maverick-new-sincerity"><em>Top Gun</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/22/18682634/toy-story-4-ending-spoilers-forky-sequel"><em>Toy Story</em></a> being rebooted and reimagined. This constant refreshing of the old is known as nostalgia-bait. Even ostensibly new shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> are kept alight by the warm, enticing glow of nostalgia. </p>
<p id="mklcFZ">While it can be exhausting to exist in a world that seems terrified of anything new, the rampant obsession with and reliance on nostalgia does make sense. Millennials have faced <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-april/index.html">endlessly increasing costs</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/01/22/why-career-stability-is-overrated-in-todays-world/?sh=471a4c1b6e55">poor job stability</a>, and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-half-gen-z-millennial-103546494.html">climate crisis</a> with no end in sight, making it seem impossible to get a leg up. We’re the first generation to be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/11/politics/millennials-income-stalled-upward-mobility-us/index.html">worse off than the one before</a>. Wanting to retreat backward into familiar, comforting childhood wish-fulfillment is a logical next step. </p>
<p id="IodGIr">Krasinski’s film, however, employs nostalgia-bait in the worst imaginable way. Instead of rehashing familiar iconography to create new ideas, <em>IF </em>employs a barrage of fluffy, calorie-free whimsy, encouraging audiences to retreat backward into themselves and cling to the imaginary creatures from their childhood. The real world, it argues, is simply too hard, too painful.</p>

<p id="DDALP0"><em>IF</em>’s human characters are incapable of facing reality. Bea’s father is obsessed with using fantasy to make things easier for Bea. When we first see him in the hospital, he’s playing with his IV bag, which he’s dressed up with a wig to make it more appealing for his daughter. This infantilization — Bea constantly reminds him that she’s not a child, in a plea for an honest conversation — prevents her from being able to cope with the potential reality of losing both her parents at age 12. That’s a truly horrifying prospect, but <em>IF </em>treats Bea’s father like a hero, and is warmly receptive to both her retreat into the imaginary and the film’s eventual reminder that the past is exactly where she belongs. </p>
<p id="s8MEqI">Given that <em>IF</em> purports to celebrate the infinite nature of imagination, it’s telling that every IF in the movie is a generic variation of readily available toys, like stuffed animals, robots, and astronauts. Even the film’s primary IF, giant purple furry Blue (Steve Carell), is little more than a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23761120/mcdonalds-grimace-shake-game-boy-birthday-pride-memes">Grimace</a> knock-off. Some IFs are, conceptually speaking, even lazier — a bubble, a banana, a sunflower, a giant gummy bear, a literal ice cube in a glass. </p>
<p id="DCfgAJ">In fact, the one solitary chuckle I let out over the course of the movie’s 104-minute run time was when said ice cube (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reveals that his kid imagined him during a moment of thirst. The surprise factor on that line got me to laugh, but the joke is alarmingly hollow, and it gets to the root of the film’s problem. The best this kid could come up with to satisfy their thirst was <em>a glass of water with an ice cube in it</em>? Not, say, an infinite fountain of all their favorite flavors of lemonade and soft drinks, including flavors not yet conceived? Perhaps a free vending machine full of tantalizing, Willy Wonka-esque magical beverages? Or at least a glass of apple juice?</p>

<p id="XMKfda">If <em>IF </em>was a smarter movie, I’d take this parade of overly obvious, unimaginative imaginary characters to be a comment on how infantilized this forced obsession with nostalgia has become — a warning that our nostalgia-coddled minds are incapable of conjuring any legitimately original images, relying exclusively on variations of familiar themes. The most subversive interpretation of this movie is that Krasinski is actually saying all we can do is revel in our past, which is deeply concerning. But believing that would mean completely misunderstanding what <em>IF </em>is so blatantly <em>meant</em> to say.  </p>
<p id="0iiDXn">[<strong>Ed. note: </strong>From here, major <em>IF </em>spoilers.]</p>
<p id="S7JIbq">The reunification between adults and their childhood imaginary friends is a key aspect of <em>IF</em>. A pivotal scene finds Blue discovering his creator-child Jeremy is now an ineffectual, anxiety-ridden adult (played by Bobby Moynihan), preparing for a big business meeting. Jeremy is deeply unhappy, you see, because he’s an adult, and there’s no joy in that. He can only find any semblance of joy in this unfeeling world when Bea and Cal help Jeremy remember Blue. The whimsy hits toxically high levels as Jeremy and Blue glow with an orange hue, and Michael Giacchino’s constant, over-the-top score signals that finally, Jeremy is at peace. As Jeremy retreats into his own childhood, he’s able to crush the meeting he was so worried about. </p>
<p id="m1Nz5v">If the message wasn’t abundantly clear then, it becomes unavoidable in the film’s big reveal: Cal isn’t Bea’s neighbor, he’s her own childhood IF. The fact that our protagonist imagined a generic adult man as her imaginary friend really exposes how lazy this film thinks childhood imaginations are.</p>

</p>
<p id="S5VI5D">But it’s more sinister than that, <em>IF </em>suggests: The only reason Bea was able to process her complicated feelings and the potential loss of her father was that she retreated from adolescence and dove head-first into the recesses of her early childhood. The film’s final sequence backs this up further, as the lost IFs are reunited with their adults, all of whom seem instantly transformed to see the creatures they created as kids. The resulting montage of loving, happy faces is meant to be tear-jerking, but it feels ugly — an absolute repudiation of reality and adult life, in favor of the emptiest, most imagination-drained fantasies possible. </p>
<p id="2HjSqP">Instead of nostalgia-bait, <em>IF </em>has created a nostalgia trap. This is a movie that vehemently rejects one of life’s greatest features — growth and development — and encourages us to live inside our pasts. It isn’t really any safer there. But as far as Krasinski and the filmmakers are concerned, at least pretending it is feels comforting. </p>

<p>MADFINGER Games has pushed out Gray Zone Warfare’s first major patch, addressing hundreds of issues in the game and improving stability across the board. Since it was suddenly released on April 30, GZW has taken the extraction shooter world by storm, giving players a vast open-world environment to explore either alone or with teammates, searching for loot and completing more than 150 tasks.</p>



<p>Now, the game’s first major patch is live and ready to be downloaded on Steam.</p>

<p>As it’s a live service game of sorts, Gray Zone Warfare will receive continuous patches and updates designed to tackle the title’s biggest issues.

Despite those teething issues, Gray Zone Warfare has proven to be a phenomenal game with remarkable potential.</p>

<p>For now, Arrowhead plans to remain independent and it doesn't foresee a massive increase in its workforce. "We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "We have to see what the future holds, but there's nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p><p>Jorjani added that the studio still aims to make "really great co-op games" and transform Arrowhead into a big name in the games industry. "When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that," Jorjani said. "But that doesn't mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."</p><p>Pilestedt added that the two don't run the company for monetary gain, as the "humbleness and the desire to just make great games" is the driving force behind them.</p><p>Helldivers 2 has been very successful on PC and PS5, as Sony revealed that the game sold 12 million units at launch to become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. This eclipses the previous record set by God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-5-million-copies-in-a-week-becomes-fastest-selling-first-party-playstation-game/1100-6509445/" data-ref-id="1100-6509445">which sold 5 million copies in the first week</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 is the best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>.</p>

A new teaser shows what looks like Snooty Steppes featuring a post-apocalyptic makeover, plus confirms that the T-60 power armor will appear in the battle-royale game soon with Chapter 5 Season 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Fortnite account <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1793056269177360818" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) posted a brief 2-second clip that was packed full of small details. For instance, there are several color styles of Fallout's power armor on display. One character uses some sort of new item, like a nitro juice that can splash onto teammates. Additionally, the short video seems to showcase a variety of weapons: the laser rifle, mini-gun, harpoon gun, and repeater.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-teases-fallout-crossover-ahead-of-post-apocalyptic-season-3/1100-6523546/" data-ref-id="1100-6523546">Fortnite teased the Fallout crossover</a> for a rumored post-apocalyptic theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/#3" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Chapter 5 Season 3, which should begin this weekend</a>.

<p data-characters="312" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After 15 years of running Arrowhead Games Studio, Johan Pilestedt has confirmed he will no longer serve as its CEO. Going forward, that position will be filled by one Shams Jorjani, an industry veteran who previously worked at fellow Swedish company Paradox Interactive as its chief business development officer.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Does this mean Pilestedt is leaving Arrowhead altogether? No, as he explains in this interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he will remain as the studio’s chief creative officer and chairman. The change in leadership is so Pilestedt can dedicate himself to game creation once again; something he hasn’t been able to do as much as CEO.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">“I realised that running an organisation of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track,” says Pilestedt. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">“Over the last year going to launch of <em>Helldivers 2</em>, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realise I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.”</p>
 <p data-characters="734" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was a pivotal release for Arrowhead, what with it being its first game since the original <em>Helldivers </em>launched in 2015. Not only was this a sequel fans had waited years for, but it was also set up as one of the PlayStation 5’s few major exclusives for 2024. And with it becoming more popular than anybody expected (even becoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>), Arrowhead needs strong leadership in order to keep its playerbase appeased and potentially grow the studio. As such, Pilestedt believes him stepping back from the CEO position is ultimately for the best, not just for himself but for Arrowhead: “Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>
 <p data-characters="654" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">With Pilestedt getting to be more hands-on with <em>Helldivers 2</em>, the aforementioned Shams Jorjani will handle, in his own words, “a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.” Aside from his time at Paradox, Jorjani has served as the chairman of Hooded Horse, the indie game publisher which released another surprise success of 2024, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/manor-lords-surpasses-devs-wildest-expectations-with-more-than-2m-copies-sold-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Manor Lords</em></a>, just last month.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Time will tell if this winds up being the right move for the company, but I can understand why Pilestedt would want to leave business side of things to someone else. No matter the field, creatives want to, well, create things, and you don’t really get to do that if you’re too busy running a company to make sure it stays afloat.</p>

Fortnite's new season - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">which includes a Fallout collaboration</a> - kicks off on Friday, and we've now gotten a glimpse of how the T-60 Power Armour will look in-game. 
</p>
<p>
A brief snippet of gameplay footage - our first from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-estimated-release-date-9406">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</a> - shows the iconic armour as seen in the Fallout games and recent TV series, stomping towards the camera. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite fans may note this location is a much-changed version of Snooty Steppes, wrecked by the upcoming arrival of an enormous sandstorm. 
</p>

<p>
The footage also shows an array of new and returning weapons set for use in the new season, including a new flamethrower weapon and gun with a harpoon on the end, a laser rifle and some kind of Mad Max-style area-of-effect healing item that grants a speed boost.
</p>
<p>
Returning weapons for next season look to include the minigun and ranger shotgun, meanwhile. Here it is to watch:

<p>
Back to the Power Armour, it looks like there will be multiple types on offer, with theming consistent to Fortnite's own Red Knight and Black Knight styles (as spotted by FortniteLeaks).
</p>
<p>
It's possible the Power Armour is offered as some kind of power-up for any character, though it seems more likely the armour is its own skin, with different variants available to unlock. 
</p>
<p>
The new Fortnite battle royale season is set to go live this Friday morning, with previous leaks pointing to upcoming Metallica, Monster Trucks, Pirates of the Caribbean collaborations - plus even more Marvel.
</p>
<p>
Last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">mini live event saw vengeful Greek god Zeus enact his revenge</a> - and an ominous-looking sandstorm unleashed on the Island's horizon.
</p>
<p>Head in-game now and you'll spot the area of the Island closest to the sandstorm is now experiencing the storm's first effects, with dirt and leaves blown around. It's a nice touch. Look further out towards the storm and you can also make out an enormous boat on its way, painted to look like a shark's head. I wonder if that'll be a new location on the Island when it arrives?
</p>

			<p>Someone has turned Bethesda's Starfield into an open-world Star Wars game with over 100 mods.</p>
<p>We are still eagerly waiting for the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-creation-kit-modders-make-their-own-planet-stories-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Creation Kit</a> from Bethesda, but a dedicated player has basically made a Star Wars total conversion package for last year's sci-fi title. As said, this open-world Star Wars conversion uses over 100 mods, including several popular Starfield mods as well as custom mods and files. As mentioned by creator 'DeityVengy', this is still a work in progress, and each day, additional mods are being discovered that are being added to the package. "This is still a huge work in progress", the creator writes. "Every day I discover a mod or two to add to this as well as new mods releasing every day. I can't wait to see what the future holds with Bethesda's upcoming creation kit."</p>
<p>We've included a video showing off this impressive Star Wars conversion for Starfield below. The main mods included are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mandalorian Suit</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aliens</em></li>
<li><em>UC Empire</em></li>
<li><em>Freestar Rebels</em></li>
<li><em>Shadow Collective - Crimson Fleet Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Purge Troopers</em></li>
<li><em>Hugin's Ecliptic Bounty Hunters</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aurebesh Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Starfield HD Overhaul</em></li>
<li><em>Boostpack to Jetpack</em></li>
<li><em>Unified Camera</em></li>
<li><em>Slightly Better Weapon Icons</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed instructions on how to install the mods can be found on <a href="https://github.com/DeityVengy/Ultimate-Star-Wars-Conversion-Modlist-for-Starfield/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github here</a>. There you'll also find the full list of mods used.</p>
<p>Starfield is available for PC and Xbox Series X|S now. As expected, this Star Wars total conversion is currently only available for the PC version. Here's what we wrote about Starfield in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year: "With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hunt: Showdown Won’t Work on PS4 or Xbox One From August]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-won%E2%80%99t-work-on-ps4-or-xbox-one-from-august.878220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently revealed by Crytek that an impending upgrade to CryEngine – which was the engine used to build Hunt: Showdown – will take the extraction shooter offline on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from August 15, 2024. Once this update has been applied, the game won’t even load on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles – but it’s not all bad news.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upgrade-for-free">Upgrade for Free</h2>



<p>Those impacted by the shutdown will be able to update to the next-generation version of Hunt: Showdown for free, Crytek revealed. In a video posted online to celebrate the upcoming upgrade, it was said that player accounts and all entitlements for Hunt: Showdown will port across from the older version of the game with ease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Your player accounts and entitlements to Hunt: Showdown and all related DLCs carry up to the new version at no additional cost when you’re ready to make the hardware transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been promised that a ‘new era’ of Hunt: Showdown will emerge in the summer with the arrival of CryEngine 5.11. For this ‘new generation’ of Hunt: Showdown, the team is working intensively on the game’s anti-cheat system, a new user interface, a recruitment and prestige system, and tweaks to the game’s Hunter mechanics. </p>



<p>There’s an inbound overhaul for the game’s core map, which will incorporate new locations and fresh threats – but only on the next-generation version of the game.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793267296682520846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> from Johan Pilestedt, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has appointed Shams Jorjani as its new CEO. </p>



<p>Following this change in leadership, Pilestedt also confirmed that they are “taking the role of Chief Creative Officer”. As a result, they plan to “spend more time with the team and 100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Big update, I've decided to hire <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShamsJorjani</a> as the new CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArrowheadGS</a>!

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesIndustry.biz</a> today, Pilestedt elaborated on the decision to hire a new CEO. They explained that “I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side.”</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that “I will have to follow my heart,” and that “having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>



<p>Jorjani stated that “what I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership,” citing their experience with Paradox.</p>



<p>Although Helldivers 2 recently faced a lot of backlash over its PSN updates, the team responded swiftly.

    <p><span>A decision of company founder Johan Pilestedt, who will remain chief creative officer and chairman.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has appointed former <a title="Companies > Paradox Interactive [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox Interactive</a> executive Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role, the company announced. <span id="more-884076"></span></p><p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman of Arrowhead Game Studios. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he explained that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on game creation versus the business side of things.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we’re going to be making, and running the organization beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,” Pilestedt said. “I realized that running an organization of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.”</p><p>He continued, “Over the last year going to launch of <em>Helldivers II</em>, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realize I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p><p>“So I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p><p>“After some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It’s not only right for me, but it’s also right for the organization. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Jorjani was at Paradox Interactive for more than 12 years, serving in roles such as chief business development officer, vice president of business development, and vice president of products. He is also a chairman of the board and investor in independent publisher <a title="Companies > Hooded Horse [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hooded-horse">Hooded Horse</a>, and an investor in <a title="Companies > CULT Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cult-games">CULT Games</a>.</p><p>“When you’re talking to creatives like Johan, it’s not like he wants to retire,” Jorjani said. “<em>Helldivers II</em> isn’t the highlight of his career. Hopefully it’s the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance… all the things that led us here.</p><p>“What I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was… it was about organization, leadership and business focus. It’s a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p><p>“Bethesda has Todd Howard, <a title="Companies > Kojima Productions [548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kojima-productions">Kojima Productions</a> has Kojima, Remedy has Sam <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a>… but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director… you can’t name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.</p><p>“So that’s the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more <em>Helldivers</em>, and what I bring is a structure around that.”</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios is an independent game developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you act fast, you can grab the coolest Nerf blaster from the Halo franchise for its lowest price ever at Amazon. <strong>Normally $100, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HMWZ6F3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-edition Needler Nerf blaster</a> is on sale for only $67.18</strong>. The iconic weapon wielded by The Covenant in Microsoft's Halo series is part of Amazon's current batch of Lightning Deals. At the time of writing (morning on May 22), just over 50% of the blasters have been claimed--this deal won't be available for long. </p><p>The Nerf Needler replica fires Nerf darts and comes with 10 Nerf Elite darts as well as a display stand to show off the item. The needs on the gun light up when you grip the handle. Note that the gun requires six AA batteries, and they are not included with the blaster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4282490" data-ratio="1" data-width="550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4282490"></a><figcaption>Nerf Halo Needler Dart Gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg"></figure><p>It has a 10-dart rotating drum that fires off the replica needles like it would in the video game series.

        <p>Streaming site will now blur or hide livestreams involving gambling, drug use or sexualised content</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Twitch has updated its site to allow users to filter out content they do no wish to see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-now-lets-you-filter-out-and-blur-unwanted-sexualised-content">Eurogamer</a> reports the new option builds on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-introduces-new-content-classification-labels">the Content Classification Labels that were introduced last year</a>, allowing streamers to tag their broadcasts for the inclusion of sexualised content, drug use, gambling, and more.</p>
<p>The changes to Twitch means that, depending on users' preferences, any streams tagged with this labels will be filtered out and hidden.</p>
<p>Alternatively, users can set it to blur the thumbnails of streams that feature sexual content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/We-re-Giving-Viewers-More-Control-Over-Their-Twitch-Experience?language=en_US">blog post</a> detailing the changes, Twitch's VP of community products Jeremy Forrester wrote: "Our goal with these changes is to make it easier for you to have a Twitch experience that’s right for you and to choose the communities that you want to be a part of. We recognize that everyone’s viewing preferences differ, and you should have more control over what you encounter when you come to Twitch."</p>
<p>Forrester also emphasised that streamers must label their content correctly, or Twitch will add the appropriate labels and make them irremovable.</p>
<p>The changes come after years of criticism around the content found on Twitch. The site has frequently been compelled to update its guidelines on what constitutes 'sexual content', although <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-sexual-content-crackdown-causing-confusion">not without inconsistencies</a>.</p>
<p>Twitch streamers broadcasting from lingerie to hot tubs became so popular, the site even <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-adds-over-350-new-tags-related-to-gender-race-mental-health-and-hot-tubs">added it as a category</a> when expanding its tags system in 2021. Earlier this year, there was even a trend where streamers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-once-again-updates-community-guidelines-prohibiting-sexualised-content">use buttocks, groins and breasts as green screens</a>.</p>
<p>Gambling has also been an issue for Twitch, prompting f<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-updates-gambling-policy-will-no-longer-allow-streaming-of-unlicensed-sites">urther changes to the site's policies in 2022</a>.</p>

Here’s everything you’ll need to get him there.</p> <h2 id="h-character-ascension" data-injectable="false">Character Ascension</h2> <h3 id="h-perpetual-caliber-aeonblight-drake" data-injectable="false">Perpetual Caliber – Aeonblight Drake</h3> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s world boss is the Aeonblight Drake in western Sumeru. Defeat the Aeonblight Drake to obtain Perpetual Calibers.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">You’ll need 46 Perpetual Calibers to Ascend Wanderer to level 90. This means defeating the Aeonblight Drake about 18 times, which equates to spending around 720 Resin at World Level 8.</p> <h3 id="h-rukkhashava-mushrooms" data-injectable="false">Rukkhashava Mushrooms</h3> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Despite being from Inazuma, Wanderer uses <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-rukkhashava-mushrooms-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rukkhashava Mushrooms</a> from Sumeru. You can find these <a href="https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=402&amp;center=3001.17,-3853.47&amp;zoom=-1.50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scattered around Sumeru</a>, primarily in Mawtiyima Forest and Apam Woods. Wanderer’s ability to fly is pretty handy for gathering mushrooms in the branches, and if you have Tighnari in your party, he will mark their locations on your minimap.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">It takes 168 Rukkhashava Mushrooms to fully level Wanderer. They take 48 hours to respawn after harvesting, and you may need to clear out your world multiple times in order to obtain enough.</p> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-handguards" data-injectable="false">Handguards</h3> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s common enemy drops are handguards, which can be obtained from any Nobushi or Kairagi. There are many of these <a href="https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=209&amp;center=5688.01,1490.09&amp;zoom=-2.00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scattered around Inazuma</a>, though their locations are somewhat inconvenient for farming. I found farming to be more enjoyable in co-op.</p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">For a level 90 Wanderer, you will need 18 Old Handguards, 30 Kageuchi Handguards, and 36 Famed Handguards. These figures don’t include handguards needed for Wanderer’s Talents.</p>
 <h3 id="h-vayuda-turquoise" data-injectable="false">Vayuda Turquoise</h3> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Like other Anemo characters, Wanderer uses teal-colored Vayuda Turquoise gems to Ascend. The Aeonblight Drake does not drop Vayuda Turquoises, so you may need to convert some from another element. You can do this at any alchemy bench using Dust of Azoth.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Wanderer will need a total of 1 Vayuda Turquoise Sliver, 9 Fragments, 9 Chunks, and 6 Gemstones.</p> <h2 id="h-talent-levels" data-injectable="false">Talent Levels</h2> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The material and Resin totals below are for maxing out all three of Wanderer’s Talents. If you need to choose, prioritize his Normal Attacks, then Skill. Wanderer’s Burst, if used at all, accounts for a small portion of his damage, so you can skip leveling his Burst if necessary.</p>
 <h3 id="h-praxis-books" data-injectable="false">Praxis Books</h3> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s Talents uses Praxis books to level up. These can be obtained from the Sumeru Talent domain on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.</p> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">For a triple crowned Wanderer, you will need 9 brown books, 63 silver books, and 114 gold books. This equates to about 2,480 Resin, depending on your drop luck.</p> <h3 id="h-handguards-1" data-injectable="false">Handguards</h3> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Handguards can be obtained from any <a href="https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=209&amp;center=5688.01,1490.09&amp;zoom=-2.00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobushi or Kairagi</a> enemies in Inazuma.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">To fully level Wanderer’s Talents, you will need 18 Old Handguards, 66 Kageuchi Handguards, and 93 Famed Handguards.</p>
 <h3 id="h-daka-s-bell-scaramouche" data-injectable="false">Daka’s Bell – Scaramouche</h3> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s weekly boss materials are Daka’s Bells, obtained from the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom (aka Scaramouche). His boss domain is found under Sumeru City and can be unlocked after completing the Sumeru Archon Quests. However, if you haven’t unlocked the domain, you can still access the challenge from the Adventurer’s Handbook.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="false">Maxing out all three of Wanderer’s Talents will require 18 Daka’s Bells. This will take about 8 weeks of farming at the highest difficulty level.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fallout-crossover-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>There’s a new teaser available online that showcases the impending Fortnite x Fallout crossover coming to the popular battle royale game next season. It lasts just two seconds and reveals exactly how this integration will work, with a squad of Brotherhood of Steel members in T-60 Power Armor suits walking across a battlefield with an array of weapons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-they-re-little">But They’re Little</h2>



<p>My biggest gripe with the uber-short teaser trailer is that it shows the characters in the T-60 Power Armor to be far too small. There’s something impressive and daunting about a suit of Power Armor, one of the most recognisable elements from the Fallout franchise, but Fortnite (understandably) slims them down for this collaboration.</p>



<p>In the two-second trailer (below), we see five suits of Power Armor, all of which boast a unique aesthetic. It’s hard to see at first blush, but it looks as though there are no custom weapon skins – or weapons – to celebrate the crossover event. It’s just the Power Armor skins.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More may be revealed soon as the new season comes closer – there’s no way this crossover event is restricted to a two-second teaser trailer, especially given the recent success and popularity of the Fallout franchise in general.</p>



<p>We’ll report more when we know it.</p>

<p>According to claims in a new report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, Sony is planning another Days of Play event for May 29, 2024, and will “last until June 12, 2024.” The event does usually last about that long.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker billbil-kun also mentioned details about the potential offers coming to the new Days of Play. They expect the likely return of a PS Plus promotion across multiple tiers, possibly repeating the same discount from last year.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Dealabs further claims that “PS5, PlayStation VR2 consoles as well as DualSense” will be among the hardware sales. The report projects some of the pricing in Europe, such as DualSense Controllers being available for 49.99 euros. </p>



<p>Last week, Sony released a financial report confirming that PlayStation 5 sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped 29% YoY</a>. Further, Sony even expects console sales to continue declining.</p>



<p>Dealabs could not confirm many games coming to Sony’s Days of Play event. However, it did mention the event should feature God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn for just 9.99 euros.</p>



<p>Fans are currently waiting for Sony to announce a God of War PC version. Fortunately, Dealabs also made claims earlier this month suggesting that something official is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-announcement-coming-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming this month</a>. It could very well appear at the rumored PlayStation showcase expected in May 2024.</p>



<p>Dealabs has successfully leaked a variety of previous announcements and details, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-death-stranding-2-news-imminent-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 announcements</a> in January.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not officially confirmed anything regarding the new Days of Play event or promotions.</p>

        <p>Company founder Johan Pilestedt remains chief creative officer and chairman</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Arrowhead Games Studios has named Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role.</p>
<p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman. The move follows the smash hit success of Helldivers 2, which has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-full-year-revenues-rise-to-275-billion-but-narrowly-misses-ps5-sales-target">sold 12 million copies since it launched on PS5 and PC in February.</a></p>
<p>Jorjani is a games business veteran and spent 12 years in senior leadership roles at Paradox Interactive. He’s also served as chairman of indie publisher Hooded Horse, and acts as a senior adviser for various games businesses.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Pilestedt explains that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on his love for game creation, while giving the company the structure and leadership it needs.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we’re going to be making, and running the organisation beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,” he tells us. “I realised that running an organisation of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.</p>
<p>“Over the last year going to launch of Helldivers 2, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realise I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p>
<p>“So I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p>
<p>“After some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It’s not only right for me, but it’s also right for the organisation. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: “When you’re talking to creatives like Johan, it’s not like he wants to retire. Helldivers 2 isn’t the highlight of his career. Hopefully it’s the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance… all the things that led us here.</p>
<p>“What I’ll be bringing to the table is organisation and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was… it was about organisation, leadership and business focus. It’s a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p>
<p>“Bethesda has Todd Howard, Kojima Productions has Kojima, Remedy has Sam Lake… but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director… you can’t name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>“So that’s the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more Helldivers, and what I bring is a structure around that.”</p>

            <p>Nobody expected the success of Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The co-op third-person shooter, which was published by PlayStation and developed by Arrowhead Games, was released in February and has gone on to sell 12 million copies in three months. It is now PlayStation's fastest-selling game – bigger than God of War, or Spider-Man or Uncharted.</p>
<p>"Depending on who you are, you’ll always point to different things [as to why it was successful]," says Arrowhead's chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt. "If you’re a business exec at a major publisher, you’d say it is the live service element that keeps players coming back, and the cheaper price point. If you’re a game designer, you’ll point to the systematic nature of the game. If you’re an artist, you’ll talk about the day and night cycle, the destructible environments and the beautiful worlds. It’s the balance between all these elements.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>"But speaking personally, I would say it’s the fact that we’re doing something with Helldivers that is outside of the inflection point that the games industry is heading towards. What you’re seeing through these cycles in the industry is people taking inspiration from each other, and building upon that. But that means people are building towards a single point, because you lose something through each iteration.</p>
<p>"With Helldivers, we made the strong decision that we’re not going to go with the status quo. We’re going to place ourselves outside of that by making a lot of mechanics that are generally not seen in games. We have friendly fire on, always. I think people are surprised that we make games this way. They’re surprised that the responsibility to not blow up your friends is on you."</p>
<p>For Pilestedt personally, the success of Helldivers 2 was the realisation of a dream he has had since he was eight years-old.</p>
<p>"I asked my dad ‘how do I make a video game company?’ And he said ‘Get really good grades’. Of course, that was a lie," he laughs.</p>
<p>The problem with realising a dream (albeit a good problem), is working out what to do next.</p>
<blockquote>"We pride ourself on being an independent studio." <cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Helldivers 2 put me into a strange mode of contemplation," he admits. "Because the problem with achieving such wild success, achieving your calling, is you have to choose your next chapter. It doesn’t come from within like knowing what you wanted to do since you were eight."</p>
<p>This led Pilestedt to Shams Jorjani. Jorjani's history with Arrowhead stretches back to the start. He was one of the organisers of the Swedish Game Awards, which Arrowhead won with its game Magicka. Jorjani then joined Paradox Interactive, which had just signed the game, and he was assigned to the project. He helped launch that and then Arrowhead's second (and significantly less successful) game, The Showdown Effect.</p>
<p>"We then had an intense negotiation over Magicka 2, which was finally resolved in an Icelandic hotel room overnight," Jorjani said. "Both of us were drunk at the time and we decided that ‘no, we won’t do that project’."</p>
<p>But the two stayed in touch. And then in 2021, Jorjani left Paradox.</p>
<p>"I had a bit of ‘big company PTSD’," he continues. "Paradox was 800 people, ten studios in six countries and a public company. After leaving Paradox, I came to Johan and said ‘let’s do something together. We might end up killing each other, but we’ll have fun’. And Johan, as wise as he is, told me to 'f off', because he had a game to ship."</p>
<p>That game was Helldivers 2. Eventually, Jorjani did start advising Arrowhead and then, with Helldivers 2 out the door,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo"> Pilestedt asked him to become CEO.</a></p>
<p>The move means Jorjani will take over the day-to-day running of the business, allowing Pilestedt to focus on game creation.</p>
<p>"We were both at a stage where we’re wondering what’s next in our careers," Jorjani says. "And we realised we probably couldn’t quite get to those places if we didn’t have the other one to help us get there."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how are we going to take Arrowhead into the future."</p>
<p>Jorjani again: "My job is to enable him and the other creative people to be able to do more games. And that’s also what matters to the players. I play Helldivers and I hear my friends ask… ‘are we going to get more stuff?’ And I’m like ‘yes, soon, because Johan will have more time to do it’. ‘We want more enemies!’ I’ll tell Johan."</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/helldivers2_Yk9zYyw.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest selling game of all time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Part of Jorjani's role will be to help Arrowhead navigate the impact of Helldivers 2's success. The firm was a successful developer already. The first Helldivers game sold four million copies, while Magicka was also a breakout hit. "They were all massive games in their genres," Pilestedt observes.</p>
<p>But Helldivers 2 is on a different level. And right from the start, the team has had to contend with a series of issues, beginning with "the servers burning to a crisp".</p>
<p>"We tried to fan that… but you shouldn't fan flames," Pilestedt says. "I told people to not buy the game until we can manage the servers… but that actually increased the amount of users, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Then there was the issue around adding the need to log-in to PlayStation Network to play the game, which resulted in a backlash from fans and Helldivers 2 becoming unavailable in certain markets. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">Sony eventually backtracked on the requirement.</a></p>
<p>Plus, there are other general live-service issues, too, such as concerns around game balancing.</p>
<p>"This is something the organisation has seen before," Pilestedt tells us. "We had the horrible launch of Magicka, which was really buggy, and me and Shams recognised that we had to interact with the community, talk to them in an honest way, and tell them what’s going on as much as we could. And then take action immediately to resolve the issues. So we’ve seen and been through it before, albeit at a much smaller scale. It is higher stakes this time."</p>
<blockquote>"The big difference is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community"<cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite> </blockquote>
<p>He adds: "When we look at the challenge ahead of us, we feel like Frodo and Sam going towards Mordor. The oblivious approach of ‘we’ll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come’. The strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other. We know that whatever we’re going through, we’re there for each other and we will be able to take on any challenge, almost, and come out stronger on the other side."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that the experience so far has been "extremely enjoyable and a little bit daunting". Helldivers was inspired by Dragons &amp; Demons (Sweden's answer to Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and the team has enjoyed playing the game master role with its community.</p>
<p>"Our game design is about transitioning our love for pen and paper RPGs into games that don’t necessarily have dice rolls and stats. A lot of these pen and paper sessions are based on a serious premise, which dissolves into farce. We’re seeing this with how the community interacts with Helldivers 2, but also how we interact with them."</p>
<p>But with 12 million fans, there's been some challenges with the community that the team hasn't experienced much before.</p>
<p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt says. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that frustration is part of the essence of the Helldivers: "If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs." And although this is something that is understood by more hardcore players, when you're reaching 12 million people, it's not something everyone is going to appreciate.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Shams.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Arrowhead’s philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one'," Jorjani explains. "That is the company slogan. It’s how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it’s one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p>
<p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought – Sony, us, everyone – what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself"</p><cite>Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Valve is supposedly launching a new PVP game, and I am sure they’ve put in hundreds, if not thousands of hours into how to handle toxic players, because they have that experience from DOTA and Counter-Strike. It’s ingrained into their product development and they can just lift those systems. All of that investment and process we’re learning painfully now will carry through to the next thing, whatever that may be."</p>
<p>It's something that's also a bit of a learning process for PlayStation. Sony isn't the most experienced publisher when it comes to live service products, although it's starting to invest in this area through new games and acquisitions of companies like Bungie.</p>
<p>"It’s been a great partnership and we’re learning together, and they’re recognising that Arrowhead can be the spearhead in learning how to do [live service] better in the future," Jorjani says. "It’s just great to have somebody there with you as you figure this out."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "We’re always chasing our tail in one way or another. We have to lay the tracks as the train moves forward. There are optimisations and workflow improvements we can make. We’re going in and tuning the organisation to have the team work at a reasonable rate. Because, right now, to some degree, we’re burning the candle at both ends. And we want to get to the point where we’re producing as much candle as we are burning."</p>
<p>The focus today is on Helldivers 2 and getting that balance right. But the studio is feeling confident, it is a strong financial position, it has strengthened its leadership team, and is now looking ahead to what's next.</p>
<p>"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt says. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ss_487d792377661b10a8ed2a5765cfcfc6893f7dbb.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The first Helldivers was very different, but still sold four million copies</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean growing its headcount exponentially, or being acquired, or going public. For Pilestedt and Jorjani, it's all about what's needed to make the games they want to create.</p>
<p>"We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt says. "We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: "The goal of the studio is to make really great co-op games. We really want to turn Arrowhead into a flagship studio, where people who want to make these kind-of games say to themselves: ‘I want to work at Arrowhead’. When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.</p>
<p>"But that doesn’t mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don’t have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>
<p>Pilestedt concludes: "We don’t run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-tac-50-loadout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-best-tac-50-loadout<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">weapon choice</a> is of importance in <em>XDefiant</em>, how you use those weapons matters. Both the technique as well as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/">your loadout</a> play a huge part in whether each gunfight is won or lost by you. Given the rather daunting nature of loadouts however, you might want a little help here and there. </p> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="49" data-injectable="false">Here’s the best Tac-50 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-attachments-and-gear-for-the-tac-50-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best attachments and gear for the Tac-50 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">The Tac-50 is similar to the AWP in Counter-Strike in that it enforces a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. It’s a one-shot kill to the body but features slow ADS time, low mobility, and a ton of recoil. If you’re good at hitting your shots it’s an absolute beast, but those who miss will find it tough to get enjoyment out of it. This loadout helps to reinforce that playstyle and give it a bit of assistance. For your attachments, you’ll want to take the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Rapid Fire</li> <li><strong>Optics:</strong> Variable Zoom</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Grip Tape</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Many of these attachments lower the ADS Speed considerably, but trade that with Fire Rate, Recoil Control, and Recoil Recovery. The Variable Zoom is added in since the default 12x zoom isn’t the most convenient. You’re also forced to use a scope anyway, so you may as well improve it.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">For your Secondary Weapon, you’re best running the <strong>M1911</strong> since it provides good firepower and is great for those close-range encounters when you get surprise attacked. Slap a Compensator, Quick or Fast Mag, and Fabric Rear Grip on it, and it’ll be great in a pinch. A <strong>Proximity Mine</strong> goes very well with this playstyle to help cover a crucial flank.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-pairs-best-with-the-tac-50" data-injectable="false">Which faction pairs best with the Tac-50?</h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As for the best faction, you’re looking at either running a <strong>Phantom with Mag Barrier or Echelon with the Digital Ghillie Suit</strong> since they can both give some cover as you take your potshots at enemies across the map. Cleaners are a decent option as well with either ability but they don’t synergize quite as well.</p>

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>XDefiant</em>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/">weapon choice</a> is only half the battle. You also need to consider the attachments, gadgets, and sidearms to bring along for the ride. This is a lot of choices to make with plenty of tweaking to be done, so it can help to have some assistance to get there. Here’s the best AK-47 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-loadout-when-using-the-ak-47-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best loadout when using the AK-47 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">The AK-47 is a mid-range <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">powerhouse</a> that offers high damage with a low rate of fire. It’s perfect for lasering targets, though falls off at longer ranges with some rough recoil and especially tough handling in full auto. As such, we want attachments that help reinforce its position at mid-range, while also giving it some help for those longer ranges. With those goals in mind, you should choose the following attachments:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Recon</li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Optics: </strong>Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Heavy Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">If you feel comfortable with the Iron Sights, then you can <strong>swap the Reflex Optic out for the Quick Mag</strong> in the Magazine slot. Otherwise, this build adds a ton of Horizontal Recoil Control that should make its recoil more predictable and easy to account for. Some ADS bonuses are added in so you can strengthen the mid-range gunfights the weapon is known for.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Secondary Weapon, we’re looking to take <strong>the iconic M1911</strong> to help with those short-range encounters thanks to its firepower. A Quick Mag for the Magazine and the Fabric Rear Grip assist this thanks to the improved ADS and Reload Speed. Finally, we want to round things out with an <strong>EMP Grenade</strong> for any Shields from the Phantoms.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-is-best-with-the-ak-47" data-injectable="false">Which faction is best with the AK-47?</h2> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="false">The best factions for this playstyle are easily the <strong>Cleaners and Libertad</strong>. The Cleaners can provide some extra damage in a pinch with the Firebomb especially, while the Libertad’s BioVida Boost will save you in a pinch. If you’re more intel-oriented, the Echelon with the Intel Suit ability can help you orient your surroundings too. It’s just more meant for the start of fights rather than in the spur of the moment.</p>

			<p>Sony's annual PlayStation promotions for this year - Days of Play 2024 - is expected to kick off next week on May 29.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-days-of-play-2023-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous years</a>, Sony will be kicking off special PlayStation promotions, and <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> renowned deals leaker 'Billbil-kun', this year's Days of Play will start next week and is expected to last between 10 to 14 days. For reference, last year's Days of Play promotions lasted for ten days across PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Gear, direct.playstation.com, and PlayStation Store, along with additional offerings available at participating retailers. Official details about this year's deals haven't been shared just yet, but the leaker did <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1793247331313148222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage to find</a> the new logo for Days of Play 2024. You can find this image at the top of this article.</p>
<p>As said, no official details have been shared just yet, but it's expected that Sony will be offering discounts on all PS Plus tiers of around 25%. "If the promotion valid during the Days of Play 2023 is repeated this time,&nbsp;the annual subscription&nbsp;should have an&nbsp;immediate discount of around -25% which would concern all Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe tiers", the leaker writes.</p>
<p>Other deals include savings on PS5 consoles, PS5 DualSense controllers, and select software titles. The following deals are to be expected (in Europe):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>50 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS5 Slim Standard consoles, for a&nbsp;final price of 499 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>50 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS5 Slim Digital&nbsp;consoles&nbsp;(without disc drive), i.e. a&nbsp;final price of 399 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>100 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS VR2 consoles, for a&nbsp;final price of 499 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>All&nbsp;DualSense controllers at 49.99 euros.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If true, Sony will likely officially announce this year's Days of Play promotions in the coming days. We'll update you as soon as more information comes in. What kind of deals would you be interested in this year? Will you be picking up a new PS5 slim console with a discount? And what about the more recent PS5 titles?

                <p>Basketball legend LeBron James is widely considered to be the greatest player to ever step into the court, but just how well would he fare against one of the mightiest Pokemon of all time? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stephen-a-smith-chooses-his-starter-pokemon/1100-6520630/">Pokemon starter expert</a> and sports commentator Stephen A. Smith was asked who he'd pick to win in a basketball game between LeBron and Mewtwo, and the TV personality believes that the genetically engineered Pokemon would actually stand a good chance of beating the NBA MVP in a game of 21.</p><p>"He's shorter than LeBron but he weighs more," Smith said in a serious analysis of Mewtwo's stats. "He can anticipate moves and stuff like that. Yeah, maybe he could pull it off. From the looks of him, he might scare LeBron. LeBron might want to shoot more jump-shots, might not want to come near him. That long tail, you never know. Might trip him. I'm not saying it definitely would happen, but it's possible. It's possible, let's go with that."</p><p>As Smith noted, Mewtwo is pretty tall, and as a Psychic-type, Pokemon he has several advantages. As demonstrated in the first Pokemon movie, Mewtwo probably wouldn't have a hard time taking control of the ball, predicting what LeBron would do next, or reflecting on the contest with <a href="https://youtu.be/UQoGyeeT2pw" rel="nofollow ">Shakespearian eloquence</a>.

		<p>When <em>Dualshockers </em>reported that Creative Assembly is developing a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/?ref=remapradio.com"><u><em>Star Wars </em>version of their <em>Total War </em>series</u></a>, the most common reaction I saw was one of skepticism. At first glance, <em>Star Wars</em> does not seem to lend itself to the combat of massed armies and close, linear formations that has been <em>Total War’s</em> bread-and-butter since its inception.</p><p>At a glance, <em>Star Wars </em>appears to be a setting where warfare is analogous to World War 2 combat: soldiers carry automatic or semi-automatic blasters, walkers function like tanks, starfighters are basically WW2 airplanes and a lot of them are carried aboard capital ships that act like aircraft carriers. By contrast, the <em>Total War </em>series has always handled pre-gunpowder armies best, and its forays into the 18th and 19th centuries have been uneven. (Why that is the case is a topic for another day.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's just a catapult! </span><i><em>Total War </em></i><span>can handle a catapult. Which is more than can be said for the Droid Army.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more <em>Star Wars </em>battles we have gotten to see, however, the less they fit that “World War 2 in Space” paradigm. Throughout the <em>Clone Wars </em>cartoon, ground combat between the Separatist Droid Army and the Grand Army of the Republic is defined by massed formations exchanging laser fire at close range. Is this in large part dictated by the limitations of the cartoon’s animation capabilities? Almost certainly, but it is also following the template Lucas established in <em>Phantom Menance </em>and <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, where the former is basically a battle of Roman legionary armies, and the latter is a point-blank melee as masses of droids try and shatter walls of clones and Jedi defenders. </p><!--members-only--><p>Hoth, likewise, doesn’t much resemble a World War 2 battle so much as a World War 1 battle or perhaps something even earlier. The AT-AT walkers are more capable than World War 1’s first tanks, but they share similar drawbacks: they are devastatingly effective at shattering an enemy line but also slow and unmaneuverable. (Their performance gets even less impressive if you read Danger Room’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>analysis of Rebel defensive tactics on Hoth</u></a>, or this piece <a href="https://cimsec.org/re-fighting-the-battle-of-hoth-an-engineers-perspective/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>re-imagining how the Rebels could have deployed the same resources</u></a> to keep the Imperials at bay, which is coincidentally a good primer on how armies evolved tactics to mitigate the threat of armored breakthroughs.) The biggest ground battle we get in the original trilogy is an assault on a besieged fortress, frankly the kind that happened a lot more <em>before </em>the World Wars than after.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ralph McQuarrie's concept painting for the Hoth Battle, displayed at Disney World</span></figcaption></figure><p>If there is any one battle that looks different from what Total War is usually about, it’s the Umbara campaign in <em>The Clone Wars. </em> Perhaps the most impressive depiction of battle in the entire series, the landings on Umbara resembled a combination of the paratroopers going into Normandy and helicopter-led US air assault tactics in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p><p>The Umbarans rely heavily on area-denial weapons, plus disruptive long range firepower that inflicted major losses on the Clone Army before they can get into small-arms range of Umbaran forces.  When the clones finally get into range of those forces, the Umbarans are piloting advanced vehicles with no support.  Effectively, it's a mechanized monster fight—and we've seen lots of monster fights in the <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>series. </p><p>(Plus, the Republic’s tactics were hindered in this battle by the fact that the Jedi in command was a turncoat. Did our glimpse of the Umbaran campaign look so different from other battles because it was truly a different tactical paradigm, or was it just that the commanding general was intentionally inflicting attrition on his forces?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Diagram of a shipboard mass driver cannon in </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><span>Battles That Changed the Galaxy</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>What of space? That’s a little harder to make guesses about. Naval warfare is something the <em>Total War </em>series has struggled with over the years, but if it could be said to have worked at all it was with games like <em>Empire </em>and <em>Fall of the Samurai</em>, where you’re basically dealing with the 18th and 19th century naval tactics—<em>Master and Commander </em>type stuff. </p><p>The thing is, that’s basically what we see in the largest naval battle in the <em>Star Wars </em>films. Lando Calrissian’s solution to the ambush at Endor is to have Ackbar bring his capital ships into point-blank range with the Imperial Star Destroyers surrounding the Second Death Star, while he and his strike craft fly cover until they can attack the Death Star itself. Unlike in real-world history, the development of strike aircraft didn’t render the battleship obsolete, and so most naval battles appear to be decided by the presence of capital ships fighting well inside visual range of one another using actual cannons with heavy artillery shells like warships used from the 16th through the 20th centuries. The biggest naval battles we see in the prequel trilogy follow similar logic, and the glimpses we get of the Imperial Navy on the fringes of the Empire in <em>Andor </em>and <em>Rebels</em> indicate that the fleet is predominated by small patrol craft and light carriers, and that the almost-invulnerable Imperial Star Destroyer is as scarce as a sight as a Ship of the Line on the far frontiers of 18th century empires.</p><figure><figcaption><span>A naval battle diagram for the Battle of Endor of the kind that is very familiar to anyone who appreciates the age of fighting sail.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final thing I would note is that Jedi, Sith, Force Witches, and even the types of special units that emerge from within the conventional armies of <em>Star Wars</em>—like the coldly competent Tactical Droids, elite combat commanders like Rex and his badass buddy Fives—are basically hero units and both <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>and <em>Three Kingdoms </em>showed that Creative Assembly is capable of putting special units like that into game system without making it fall apart. Personally, I think the way it approached hero units in <em>Three Kingdoms </em>is a bit more in keeping with <em>Star Wars</em> (there’s only one Anakin Skywalker just like there’s only one Lu Bu) but you can see it working a few different ways.</p><p>So it isn’t hard to imagine Creative Assembly depicting battles that feel authentically <em>Star Wars</em>. The films have never been particularly interested in convincing military tactics as much as they have privileged packing a frame with scenes of awesome combat. The <em>Total War </em>series has always been similar: its battles look like movies or military paintings more than actual combat as related by participants, where war is always harder to perceive and understand in the confusion of battle. You can very easily imagine a lot of typical <em>Total War </em>battles unfolding with the types of armies we see throughout <em>Star Wars </em>films and television.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Like this has never happened to you in a Total War game.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more doubtful thing, at this stage in Creative Assembly’s life as a studio, is whether it can make a game that feels authentic and interesting with the wildly varied source material of <em>Star Wars</em>. The studio’s model has increasingly shifted to DLC—to the point that a lot of folks have come to believe <em>Total War </em>can only work if a setting can support dozens of factions—and it isn’t hard to imagine a Star Wars game that feels like a thinly reskinned Total War game of the type we’ve seen countless times before, with variation coming via fanciful DLC packs that start to resemble the goofy <em>Star Wars </em>action figures and playsets of the past. I think if this comes to fruition we have every chance of seeing a surprisingly good <em>Star Wars </em>game at launch… and then two years later playing an increasingly poorly-balanced and buggy version of the same game as we try out the new Hutts of Hoth Expansion and await <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the inevitable blog post</u></a> titled “An Apology and a Roadmap for the Hutts of Hoth”.</p><p><em>P.S. Because some folks are going to miss the link in the caption: the stills throughout this piece are from </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Battles That Changed the Galaxy</em></a><em>, which is quite a lot of fun as a work of fictional military history, in the form of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Battles-World-War-I/dp/B000KT4W7I?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>exactly the kind of history book</em></a><em> that set me on course to be whatever the hell I am today.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/returning-multiversus-players-get-season-1-premium-battle-pass-and-jason-voorhees-for-free<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>MultiVersus developer Player First Games has outlined the game’s new launch plans, including the content of its premium battle pass, and revealed how monetization will work.</p><p>Warner Bros.' Smash Bros.-style brawler launches proper on May 28 after it was brought offline following what is now called the open beta period.</p><p>In a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Player First Games said returning players who log in by June 11 get the Season 1 premium battle pass for free. This means they also get playable character Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th for free.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/jason-1920-1080-1536x864-1716374436634.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Player First Games revealed a first look at the battle pass interface, which gives off strong Fortnite vibes. “We’ve increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers by adding more ringouts, character variants, taunts, and currency,” Player First Games said.</p><p>You can now earn the premium currency (Gleamium) through both tiers, which can be used to buy various in-game items, whether it’s for new characters or saving to use towards the next season’s premium battle pass.</p><p>Jason Voorhees is part of the premium battle pass, as are more variants, ringouts, taunts, and currency. The premium battle pass also lets you earn enough Gleamium to get the next premium battle pass, Player First Games confirmed. Jason Voorhees will also be available via character tokens or in-game currency when the pass is over.</p><p>At launch, the Season 1 battle pass will last for eight weeks, and the final tier of the pass will be repeatable, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you reach the end of it early.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/image-63-1536x842-1716374462561.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Returning players who already have existing character tokens in their inventory can still use them to unlock characters, but MultiVersus will not offer new character tokens from launch. Neither will it offer new battle pass tokens, but if you already have some you can still use them to unlock the premium battle pass tier.</p><p>Player First Games has introduced new replacement currencies “to focus more on specific reward types.” Fighter currency can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters. “Keep in mind, Fighter currency is different from character tokens, and it cannot be exchanged for character tokens,” Player First Games warned. Players can also try out new characters through the weekly free character rotation, which will work the same way as it did during the open beta.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, there is a separate Perk currency you can use to get perks. And there’s a Prestige currency that “rewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters.” Each cosmetic item you get awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity. Eventually, you’ll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game, Player First Games explained. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency. </p><p>“When we launch, all returning players will receive an allotment of Prestige currency based on the number of cosmetics they acquired during the open beta as a reward for all previous purchases and unlocks,” the developer added.</p><p>That’s four separate virtual currencies for the free-to-play brawler. It’s all a bit confusing, so hopefully the below image adds some clarity:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/mvs-currency-redux-5-1536x864-1716374479417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Gold currency previously available is no more. Player First Games said it will dish out commemorative cosmetics that correlate to a player’s Gold earned during the open beta. These are exclusive items that can’t be earned any other way.</p><p>And finally, Player First Games will reset all perks from the open beta. As mentioned, perks are now unlocked using the Perk currency, attainable through playing the game, and all players will receive an allotment that correlates to the number of perks unlocked from the open beta. Player and account mastery tracks will be set to level one at launch. “Mastery tracks are a great way to give you both short-term and long-term goals when starting out, and ultimately, we want to give all players the chance to earn lots of items,” Player First Games said.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-jason-voorhees-from-friday-the-13th-and-agent-smith-from-the-matrix">Warner Bros. revealed two new playable characters for MultiVersus</a>: the aforementioned Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix. Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith join the MultiVersus roster alongside DC Super-Villain The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy. Jason Voorhees is available at launch, while Agent Smith will release later in the season.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

While AngryCatster admits there are several issues with the port, such as some "funky" geometry, imperfect terrain textures, and the possibility of falling off the map, it's perhaps the first step in a full recreation of The Witcher inside The Witcher 3.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-announces-a-remake-of-the-witcher-in-unreal-engine-5">Fool's Theory is recreating the game in Unreal Engine 5</a>, of course, but that will be a complete reimagining instead of just a straight port like this mod.
