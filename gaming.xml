            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kai Cenat has beaten his subscriber world record, racking up more than 580,000 concurrent Twitch subscribers during his Mafiathon 2 superstream. He has easily stormed past all previously set records, and since November 2, his channel has been live 24 hours a day. There’s no sign of the subathon slowing down.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the superstar streamer found himself in hot water following a bit on his broadcast that saw him and his friends ‘hang’ someone, prompting Kai to be concerned about getting banned from Twitch for what was later revealed to be a planned prank.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-kai-hang-someone">Did Kai Hang Someone?</h2>



<p>On social media, clips of the event are being circulated like wildfire, showing a topless man hanging from a high bar on Kai Cenat’s stream. A rope is pulled and the man, whose hands are bound, hangs for a few seconds, kicking his legs, until he’s brought down from the noose.</p>



<p>He’s then tended to by a medical team.</p>



<p>At first blush, Kai and his team seemed to be shocked and perplexed about the event. They’d strolled out into Kai’s garden not knowing what to expect, then they found a man willing to be hoisted <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2311951387?t=4h29m49s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">up in a noose live on stream</a> – for clout and content, of course.</p>



<p>As a preface, it was revealed that the man being hung was Max Major, a YouTube ‘magician’ with a professional penchant for tricks like this. Later on, Kai shared a video, in which Major explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don’t know is that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight, but the choices that you made since the day that we met. </em></p>



<p><em>Since the first time we met, you pushed me, you challenged me, and you wanted to see me fail. And I thought tonight, I’ll give you exactly what you asked for.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>By that point, Kai had already beaten his Twitch subscriber record, but the stunt was able to push him even further and put him in a high-ranking position on various social media platforms as a trending topic.</p>

That said, Advent Children's highly detailed CGI quality was lauded upon release, and even today, it stands as a testament to Square Enix's powerful tech--especially this 4K Blu-ray edition.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$11.89 (was $31)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has a notorious reputation as a failure that cost Square Enix (at the time Squaresoft) millions of dollars and eventually led to Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi leaving the company, it's still worth checking out for die-hard Final Fantasy fans--especially when the 4K edition is on sale for this low--click the coupon box on the listing to get the full discount.</p><p>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within looks and sounds unlike most other Final Fantasy properties, especially of the era, taking place on Earth in the distant future, and featuring a hard sci-fi plot with only the most tenuous ties to the rest of the franchise. Nevertheless, it deals with similar ideas as Sakaguchi's other work--namely the exploration of Gaia theory and ideas like life forces connecting living things--and it features surprisingly gorgeous CGI for the time.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$13 (was $16)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV fleshes out the story of Final Fantasy XV, giving fans a look at events that were not shown in-game.

While he was executive producer on early games like C<em>rash Bandicoot: Warped</em> and <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em>, he later moved into leadership role across the business group, eventually becoming president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide studios. </p><p>He told the PlayStation podcast that <em>Journey</em>’s release in 2012 on PS3 as a download-only indie hit that went on to win Game of the Year was a career highlight. “But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life,” Yoshida said. “The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p><p>The executive was also well know for his own development experience and design sense. In one pivotal moment during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_R-K_IoUc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_R-K_IoUc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentary about the making of 2018's <em>God of War</em></a></span>, Yoshida’s harsh criticism of an in-development build of the game becomes a make-or-break moment for the now-acclaimed reboot. He eventually stepped down from being the head of Worldwide studios in 2019, at which point then-Guerrilla Games studio head Hermen Hulst stepped into the role amid a reshuffling of PlayStation leadership. Hulst is now co-CEO of PlayStation alongside Hideaki Nishino.</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement marks the second major departure from PlayStation in under a year, after previous Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan retired last spring. It will also leave the console maker without one of its most high-profile execs and visible faces in the community, with a long track record of popularity among fans. He’s perhaps best known for his part <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the infamous 22-second E3 2013 clip</a></span> demonstrating how games are shared on the PS4, a stunt that kicked off Sony’s current high-end console dominance. </p><p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement comes on the eve of PlayStation’s 30th anniversary on December 3. In addition to the release of a retro line of PS5 consoles and accessories to celebrate, fans are also wondering if Sony might be teasing additional reveals or even a mini-showcase before the year is out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>

Because codes weren’t available early and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game">unexpected turbulence</a> at takeoff made it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flight-sim-2024-players-getting-stuck-in-hours-long-loading-screens-xbox-says-its-working-on-the-issue">literally impossible to play</a> for the first 24 hours, I’m still working on my up and coming aviation career, as well as this review. For now, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has some extraordinary features to set it apart, but its impact is also falling short of how blown away I was by the last edition, and I really wanted to be blown away. Instead, I'm "merely" impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right off the rip, the biggest new addition to Flight Simulator 2024 is its career mode. You pick a starting airport as your home base, get hired by a fictional aviation company, and begin progressing through your career as a pilot. It all plays out like a traditional video game skill tree: after you master the beginner missions, you open up new options, and completing them opens up further opportunities still. So you can get a tail wheel endorsement, for example, after you complete the requirements for a commercial pilots license, which then opens up options for newer planes and jobs like search and rescue, or you can get certified in rotor craft (helicopters) which leads to stuff like operating a sky crane. Which, to me personally, elicits a "hell yeah." Each new certification or endorsement also opens up different jobs you can pick from, ranging from simple stuff like flightseeing, to more complex operations like, well, anything to do with the helicopters, basically.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Real-World Locations</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually you earn enough money and reputation to throw off the bonds of your employment and start your own aviation company. I haven't gotten that far yet, but I am moving along with my fixed wing endorsements at a pretty good pace. To what end, I haven't yet decided, but I'm looking forward to opening my own company and taking the lion's share of the profits. Those profits are used to further grow your business, and I can’t wait until I can afford my own fleet of aircraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first few missions in career mode are just basic flight training, meant to familiarize you with the ins and outs of flying a plane. What I found disappointing is that the flight training is pretty much identical to the tutorials from 2020. All the training missions take place at the same airfield in Sedona, Arizona as 2020 and the actual tasks are exactly the same. The only real difference is that the AI-generated instruction and on-screen advice is a little more clear about what's expected of you in any given mission. I do appreciate the default tooltips in 2024 because there are about a million different buttons that do a million different things, and I used to have to go to Google whenever I'd forget how to release my parking brake. (I don't even think I'll end up turning them off like I did in 2020, just because I'm a forgetful fellow.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The further you get in career mode, the more mission types open up.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After the initial training missions, you do a few flights to get enough hours in to test for your commercial pilot's license. Taking the tests costs in-game currency, but you only need to pay for it once and you can retake it as many times as you need. You also need to have enough experience and do well enough in the training missions – but if you are already an experienced pilot, you can just jump right into the test and skip the lessons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The further along you get, the more missions and mission types open up. What I thought was a little strange, however, was that they don't all open up near your home airport. I picked a small airfield in the deepest parts of eastern Maine, KMVM Machias Valley Airfield, but after my initial missions, I was being sent to Europe to complete aircraft delivery and skydive missions. It's not something that bothers me too much, but it did come across as odd, which pulled me out of the “career” illusion I had built up for myself. Lousy imagination!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, I'm actually really loving career mode. In 2020’s iteration, I would make-up little missions for myself, like delivering pizza by air from Knox County Regional Airport in Owl's Head, Maine to the remote Matinicus Island 20 miles off the coast (a real thing that happens, by the way). Having structured reasons to better familiarize myself with the aircraft and patterns in the sky is going to keep me on course, so to speak, and stealthily make me into a better sim-pilot. So far it's my favorite part of Flight Simulator 2024 and I'm looking forward to starting either my own airline or a helicopter sky crane company. Or both! I've got time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition is the challenge league. This mode is the most game-y of them all, but retains all the simulation flight models and physics I love. There are three challenges each week, as well as leaderboards, which I am a huge fan of because I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the three available in the first round, my favorite is the F/A-18 rally race through the Grand Canyon. You fly Maverick's modern jet of choice through a section of the canyon, slaloming gates in a hunt for pure speed. Since it's still the same flight model under the hood, that’s not as easy as it seems – but holy crap is it fun as hell. It took me a lot of tries to get to my final score of around 1 minute 54 seconds, and that's not even a <em>good </em>score: it only put me in the Bronze league. But the satisfaction of seeing my time raised up above the Xbox Live Gamertag of someone who I don't know at all, but is unknowingly my arch-nemesis, is great. I'm looking forward to revisiting the challenges each week. The previous Flight Simulator had landing challenges with leaderboards, too, but as fun as those were, they didn't quite hit the dynamism of flying a fighter jet through one of the world's seven natural wonders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Take Your Pic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the things I liked the most about the last Flight Simulator was how it let me visit places I'd either never been before or would almost certainly never visit again. In Flight Simulator 2024, sightseeing has been placed front and center in the photo challenges mode. You visit famous landmarks and places around the world and take photos of them. The type and criteria of the photos changes with each landmark. For example, in the first photo challenge, you need to take a picture of the Great Sphinx while the sun is above its right shoulder on the equinox. Oh, and you need to do it on foot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's one of the biggest and coolest new features: you can land, get out of your plane, and walk around. However, it's not quite as elegant as I had hoped it would be. First of all, your walking speed is paced realistically, just like the rest of the simulator, (who would have guessed?) so if you've been playing first-person video games all your life, walking at an actual human's pace feels almost painfully slow. Secondly, the level of detail is going to depend on a whole bunch of different factors, like the power of your PC, the strength of your internet connection, and the health of the cloud servers, so your mileage can (and probably will) vary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in spite of some weirdly GoldenEye-esque objects around the Great Pyramid complex, the up-close terrain itself is really detailed. The sand and desert rocks look incredibly realistic, and the ground in general now seems to look more like how ground is actually supposed to look around the world. If you taxi through tall grass at the end of a rural runway, for example, the tracks from your wheels remain even when you return later. Same thing with snow or mud. Mud will even stick to your wheels and supposedly have an effect on your aerodynamics, although I can't speak to how true that is on account of never having flown an actual plane with mud-caked tires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also way more animals now. Instead of static points on a map telling you "there is a giraffe here," animals now pop up in the places you'd expect them to be. I very much felt like I was actually at an airfield in Maine when a bull moose plodded its way across the airstrip as I held short of the active runway. I haven't seen any other animals myself, but I know they're there because Flight Simulator 2024 uses an open-source database of animal locations to put them where they're supposed to be – so with some luck, I can go to Africa and see some lions before long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Graphical Improvements</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when you lift your head up from the ground, Flight Simulator 2024 can look much better than its predecessor across the board (with an emphasis on <em>can</em>). The improvement is especially stark in a place like the Grand Canyon, which I visited many times in 2020’s Flight Simulator. Whereas before it looked very obviously like a smooth, texture-mapped computer model up close, now it looks amazingly like the real thing. I am currently running Flight Simulator 2024 on a pretty beastly PC: it has an i9-13900K processor, a Radeon RX 7900XT GPU, and 64GBs of DDR5 RAM (disclosure, the RAM was provided by Corsair). With that setup, this year’s Flight Simulator looks and runs way better. Mostly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem comes from the fact Flight Simulator 2024 is streamed from the cloud, and so far they haven't ironed out all the issues. In career mode, I did a flightseeing mission around Venice, Italy, and St. Mark's Basilica was a purple-checkered polygonal model with no textures whatsoever, while the rest of Venice was rendered in perfect detail. I honestly would rather have something like the world map packs of 2020’s Flight Simulator living on my SSD and only stream the boring parts. Right now, though, there's no way to do that, and the reliance on cloud streaming was something the Flight Simulator team really hammered on the importance of leading up to launch, so I'd be surprised if they switched to some kind of hybrid model at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in spite of everything looking really good on my beastly PC, it's worth noting that my GPU is running at 100% capacity at the recommended settings in order to make that happen. When I turned the graphics down to the next lower preset, it only brought GPU usage down to 98%. That ain't good. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Current Thoughts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of what can reasonably be described as a catastrophic launch, I'm already pretty much in love with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – I'm just not blown away like I was five years ago, when I first found myself faced with the opportunity to fly to literally any place on Earth. That option remains, of course, and it's been vastly improved by some smart new features, but it doesn't have that same impact, either. As we move away from the rocky launch, I'm encountering fewer and fewer issues, which gives me the chance to focus on what I love about Flight Simulator. Usually that’s flying around aimlessly, but this time career mode is also giving me real reasons to take off, as well as a better understanding of the world of commercial aviation. I'm going to keep at it before I render my final verdict, but right now, in spite of its initial problems, I think Flight Simulator 2024 is pretty damn great, even if it hasn’t caught the lightning in a bottle that was the last Flight Simulator once again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love [<a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>], I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida joined Sony Interactive Entertainment, then Sony Computer Entertainment, when it was still just a department under PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi.</p><p>“Ken’s team was doing the development, and there was another team under <a title="Companies > Sony Music Entertainment Japan [246 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-music-entertainment-japan">Sony Music Entertainment Japan</a> making games for Super <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a>, and that was another small team preparing to make games for PlayStation,” Yoshida said. “So the two teams merged, Ken’s team under Sony and Sato-san’s team under Sony Music Entertainment Japan, to create Sony Computer Entertainment in November 1993. When the company was established as a joint venture, we held a party and everybody was in one room at the hotel [laughs]. I remember we had about 80 people total. We were very small.”</p><p>Yoshida’s job was to talk to publishers and developers in Japan, making phone calls and visits in hopes that they would make games for PlayStation. Yoshida eventually became president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, today known as PlayStation Studios, before stepping down to lead Sony Interactive Entertainment’s indie games initiative.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“When I was managing [PlayStation Studios] working with big studios, making AAA games was great,” Yoshida said. “However, when I went to events like E3 or Gamescom, I always went to the indie game area. And I found games that I liked, and oftentimes the developer was there showcasing it. So I’d take a photo with the developer, trying to help promote these games.”</p><p>As for what the future holds, Yoshida said while he has no plans yet, he <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1861562394251825531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would like to stay in the industry</a>, helping independent game developers.</p><p>“I have a couple of events to visit. The Game Awards are in December. I have commitments to the Taipei Game Show in January and <a title="Companies > DICE [231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/dice">DICE</a> Summit in February, because I’m on the board… so that I’ll continue to do. But other than that, I have no plan. I enjoy my free time… I would like to continue to help indie developers or indie publishers if they need me. So I’ll probably continue to help these creative, talented indie teams in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Ops 6 features classic CoD Zombies, marking a true return to form. The series has seen a litany of iconic Zombies maps down the years, but Tranzit is highly regarded, and much loved, and rumors abound the legendary locale could be ready for another round in BLOPS 6. </p>



<p>It’s been a joy to play both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> in Black Ops 6 Zombies. They each possess characteristics and sport trademarks of the great Zombies maps of yore. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a> on the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies fans are being spoiled.</p>



<p>With three Zombies maps already confirmed, the internet is already rife with speculation about a potential fourth. If gossip is to be believed, the fourth—or any subsequent maps—may turn back the pages of history and welcome back Tranzit to a new audience.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-tranzit-come-to-zombies-in-black-ops-6-dlc-rumors">Will Tranzit Come to Zombies in Black Ops 6? DLC rumors</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No time for food. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no confirmation of Tranzit returning in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and nothing has leaked via data mining at this moment.</strong></p>



<p>Anything you read about Tranzit returning in Black Ops 6 is pure speculation and conjecture. There is genuinely nothing to substantiate this rumor, but there is a reason why the Tranzit conversation continues to lurk around every undead corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tranzit-rumored-for-black-ops-6">Why is Tranzit rumored for Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Tranzit rumor is based on the <strong>“Black Ops 6: ‘The Truth Lies’ – Live Action Reveal Trailer”</strong> launched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s official YouTube channel</a> back on <strong>May 28</strong>.</p>



<p>Several references pertaining to Tranzit pop up during the 57-second trailer. You can see the footage in its entirety below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Ops 6: 'The Truth Lies' - Live Action Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V08UPqchVgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Interestingly, one of Call of Duty’s leading social media personalities, where Zombies is concerned—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrRoflWaffles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrRoflWaffles</a>—broke down why they think Tranzit is destined for a revisit in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>They found several familiar-looking objects and locations in the trailer, and went as far as to say a “<strong>Tranzit-inspired remake</strong>” could be on the cards, but stressed it’s only a “<strong>theory</strong>.”</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Again, this is all we have on the Tranzit rumors right now. Trust me, I want to see the map return just as badly as many of you reading this right now do. </p>



<p>If you’re a newer CoD player, Black Ops 2’s Tranzit has a special place for many due to its unique map design—featuring a moving bus taking you to several mini-locations all within the overall confines of the map. You could also customize and upgrade the bus mid-round, and it’s still one of the most original Zombies maps to date.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as you never, we may find official information confirming or shutting down the Tranzit rumor.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly working on an Animal Crossing-inspired game called Alterra. In the game, players will build their home on an island inhabited by NPCs called "Matterlings." Players can leave their home to discover new biomes, Matterlings, and materials out in broader environs.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> first reported on Alterra's development. According to the report, the game will use voxels to generate its world. For the unfamiliar, voxel graphics display cubes on a grid, a la Minecraft. Alterra is also set to feature building and crafting mechanics, letting players construct items and locations out of materials they find out in the world. The report claims Alterra was developed from a cancelled project which also used voxel graphics.</p><p>Insider Gaming claims they have seen images of Alterra's NPCs. The Matterlings are reported to resemble Funko Pops, i.e. cartoon figures with large heads, albeit in a voxel style. Some Matterlings resemble fictional creatures like dragons, others real-world animals like birds and polar bears.</p><p>The report asserts that Alterra is under development at Ubisoft Montreal. Patrick Redding (formerly lead on Gotham Knights) is the project's creative director. Fabien Lhéraud--who has worked as a marketing, brand, and media manager at Ubisoft for over 20 years--is Alterra's lead producer. The report indicates that the game has been in development for 18 months and is likely still years away.</p>

They asked people to share their photos of seeing <em>Wicked</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hundreds of people did</a></span>. It was all very depressing and frustrating to see. It then led to even more people calling out the initial post and getting into online debates.</p><p>The arguments that the people taking photos usually trot out include things like, “I had my screen dimmed and only took one or two pictures!” or “I paid money, I’m allowed to use my phone!” or even “I want to chat with my friends while watching a movie.” </p><p>All of these arguments are dumb. </p><p>I don’t care how dim your device’s screen is, you taking a photo is annoying. I’d also wager that anyone willing to hoist their camera up—possibly blocking other people’s view of the screen—to take an image of the movie in a packed theater is likely the kind of person who might also start singing or talking loudly, ruining the experience for other people trying to enjoy the film.</p><p>Also, you paid money for a ticket to watch a movie. That’s it. That ticket doesn’t magically make you more important than anyone else or absolve you from following the same rules that apply to all moviegoers at your theater. How many fucking ads and videos begging you to turn off your phone and be quiet do you need to see before the movie starts? </p><p>And if you want to chat with your friends or text or video call them or whatever, why are you doing that in a theater? If you are trying to reach someone because of an emergency, step outside. If someone you really want to talk to DMs you, step outside. If you get a phone call, please, step outside! </p><p>One time while at a movie, I got a phone call from my father. I had my phone set to vibrate and when I got the call, I looked down, saw he called, got up and texted him from the hallway. It wasn’t an emergency, so I told him I’d call back later, put my phone away, and went back to my seat. It’s really that easy. </p><h2 id="h134362"><a id=""></a>Stop ruining the  experience</h2><p>As for taking photos or videos of the screen for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-tiktok-ban-baldurs-gate-3-genshin-impact-1851335795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-tiktok-ban-baldurs-gate-3-genshin-impact-1851335795">TikTok or whichever social media platform</a></span> you prefer, just don’t do it. Perhaps you don’t care about the experience of seeing a movie in a dark theater, but a lot of people do. A lot of folks pay money, not a small amount these days, to eat some popcorn and enjoy a movie on a big screen in a room where we all collectively agree to be quiet and focused on one thing: the movie. </p><p>It’s a truly amazing and magical experience. </p><p>That might sound corny or like I’m taking movies super seriously, but I’m just being honest. I think you should watch movies however you want at home. Watch the latest arthouse flick on your phone. Binge the same MCU movies over and over and claim they are true cinema. Fine! But when you are in public in a theater, you have to act better. You have to have good movie manners. </p><p>And look, I get it. I’m far too online. My job forces me to be online all the time. My phone is with me 24/7. I check the news at 2 a.m. and work on my vacation. I understand it might be hard to disconnect. But what I love about seeing a movie in a theater is that it forces me, for a few hours, to truly disconnect from reality and all the stresses of living online and just... disappear into a movie. Take advantage of this one rare moment where society (mostly) agrees on disconnecting and being quiet. </p><p>When some jackass starts using their phone, it breaks all of that, especially if the screen is bright or they are being loud. I don’t want to hear your text message notification noise. I don’t want to see your phone’s glowing screen in the corner of my eye. I just want to watch a movie in a dark, quiet room on a giant screen for like three hours, and I paid money to do so. Don’t ruin that. </p><p>If you can’t stop using your phone or talking, then go watch a movie at home and do whatever you want. That’s fine! Just leave theaters for people able to keep their phones in their pockets, muted and mostly forgotten, for a few precious hours. Please. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's Switch might be nipping at its heels, but PlayStation 2 continues to hold the record as the best-selling console of all time - with Sony now confirming the machine has shifted a whopping 160m units since launching all the way back in March 2000.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard that figure, of course; former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan casually claimed a total of 160m PlayStation 2s had been sold during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/03/29/official-playstation-podcast-episode-481-heres-to-you-jim/">farewell edition of PlayStation Podcast</a> earlier this year, but Sony has now updated its <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">PlayStation history page</a> to reflect that number, finally making it <em>officially</em> official.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 2's last major sales milestone was trumpeted back in 2011, when Sony revealed the console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-2-ships-over-150-million">surpassed 150m sales</a> - although it only took another year for that number to jump up by a further 5m. So while sales have undoubtedly slowed - not exactly surprising seeing as Sony hasn't produced a PS2 since January 2013 - the fact the console has successfully managed to shift another 5m units in the interim is still pretty wild.

<figcaption>And now for something a bit more recent.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzdV8lR82N4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
To put that into some sort of perspective, PlayStation 5 is currently at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">65m lifetime sales</a>, while PS4 has sold 117m units, PS3 is at the 87m mark, and PS1 was snapped up by 102m Vib-Ribbon fans. Nintendo's DS handheld <em>almost</em> came close to matching PS2's previously announced figure, shifting 154m units, but it now trails someway behind. As for Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">currently at 146m sales</a>), it could still reign victorious if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> doesn't get in its way.
</p><p>
For all this competitive chatter, 160m PS2s sold is still an impressive achievement, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article">read more about the console's success elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>. It's not Sony's only cause for celebration, of course, given the entire PlayStation brand is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">marking its 30th anniversary</a> in exactly one week's time. And all this because of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultra-rare-nintendo-playstation-prototype-sells-at-auction-for-gbp230-000">falling out with Nintendo</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-the-hell-does-stalker-2-go-on-my-pc.1046103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/stalker-2-ssd-hdd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have come into possession of <em>Stalker 2</em>, a game people keep telling me I would like. I’ve actually never played a <em>Stalker</em>, but I do like the idea of the series a lot. The problem I have now is that I have no idea where to put it on my PC.</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way: I’m not the most <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC-savvy guy</a> out there. Since first building (or, being party to the building of) my PC in 2014, I’ve upgraded it in little bits. One part I’ve largely neglected is my drives: at some point, my most competent friend added an SSD to boot from, while I keep all my games on a much bigger hard drive. This has served me pretty well, even if my PC-building role model Kirk Hamilton thinks it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kirkhamilton.bsky.social/post/3lbj6khewbc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdated</a>, and even as more and more games claim they require an SSD.</p><p>But here comes <em>Stalker 2</em>, requiring a whopping 160 GB and <em>demanding</em> an SSD. At first glance, neither of my drives had the space for it, which was honestly a bit perplexing. What the fuck is on here? And which drive should I prioritize clearing–does it <em>really</em> need an SSD, or is this just the intimidating kind of thing games tell you more and more these days? Comparison videos on YouTube haven’t been entirely helpful–I’m willing to sit through long load times, but there are so many other system variables that it’s hard to get a clear sense of how the game would run on my HDD. Meanwhile, people in the forums are engaged in heated debates about the SSD requirement, with some saying the game ran fine on their HDDs, and others calling people idiots for even asking.</p><p>I took a trip through both my drives, trying to understand why they’re so full. It’s like the world’s worst guessing game: Is <em>Cyberpunk</em> still on here, hidden away in wherever the hell the GOG launcher is? How many times have I installed and uninstalled <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, and what could my Rockstar launcher password be? Is <em>Overwatch </em>in here somewhere? <em>Apex Legends</em>? Are they on Steam or Epic or in their own launchers? Can I live without <em>The Witcher 3</em> on my computer? Should I just finish that <em>Dishonored 2</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealth run</a> instead of all this, which would explain why the game is still installed?</p><p>Other discoveries were just baffling. How did 2020’s <em>Tell Me Why</em> get on my SSD? Why do I still have the <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> beta from 2016? When did I own a flight stick, such that I have flight stick software? Is Xsplit even still around? When was I so into pixel art that I have <em>three</em> different programs for it? What the fuck is a virtual cable, and why do I have so many?</p><p>This is the problem with having owned the same drives for so long: all that digital detritus piles up, until it’s an unfathomable tangle of things I have no idea how to go about cleaning out, especially with my shaky PC knowledge. Some of these mysterious programs are probably badly-named but foundational, while others are just junk. How do I even start figuring this out? And is all of this even worth it for a game I might not like?&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve managed to clear <em>just enough</em> space on my SSD, and much more space on my HDD, which has now led me back to the first question of where I should put <em>Stalker 2</em>. Is it exactly 160, or does it need some headroom, meaning my HDD would be the better choice? Is this question itself a fundamental misunderstanding of disk space? My gut is to just put it on my HHD and see how I get along, because I’ve always considered the SSD the sacred space where the most important workaday stuff goes (a category I guess<em> Tell Me Why</em> fell into?), and also because now I want to know for sure how essential an SSD truly is. But also, I only have so much time in my day, and on this planet. I am also, despite being an anarchist, a stickler for the rules; if the game demands an SSD, is it folly to fight it?</p><p>The obvious solution here is to join the current decade, get my PC-building friend to take me to Microcenter, buy an SSD which are now cheap and plentiful, and solve this problem once and for all. But they’re currently out of town, and the thought of shopping on Black Friday is a bit chilling. Damn you, <em>Stalker 2</em>. You’d better be worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It just became way less of a hassle to launch 2K games from your Steam library. The publisher has officially removed its launcher from every game that used it on Steam (and the Epic Games Store). The removal went through on November 18, but a follow-up update to ensure the Launcher was fully removed dropped on November 25.</p><p>Many games, including Bioshock Remastered, Marvel's Midnight Suns, and The Quarry, will now launch directly through Steam. Other games used the launcher for additional functionality. Those games will now launch a small submenu before opening the game itself.</p><p>For example, XCOM 2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad used the 2K launcher for mod management. Now, launching the game will open a small menu which will let you open the mod launcher or the selected game directly. For both games, this change lets you install and use mods on Steam Deck, though the Chimera Squad menu may have some graphical and interface glitches on the portable device.</p><p>Some files from the launcher may remain. The 2K launcher folder has been replaced with a text file entitled 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. You can also search for remaining files in your Windows search bar with the following text: "%localappdata%\T2GP Launcher" and "%appdata%\T2GP Launcher." You can find a more detailed tutorial for deleting the launcher's files on the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2K support site</a>.</p><p>This update follows confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-wont-require-2k-launcher-on-pc/1100-6525824/" data-ref-id="1100-6525824">Civilization 7 would not require the 2K launcher</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-gamescom-first-look-and-qa-a-crpg-about-magic-vs-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style of game</a> that New Arc Line was shaping up to be, it had some pretty big boots to fill. I wasn't sure what to expect with my time with New Arc Line, but I found that for the vast majority of my playthrough of the cRPG that is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available in early access</a>, I was pleasantly surprised. The game has a lot of potential but still needs just a little bit more fine-tuning to really make it shine.</p>
<p>Diving into the game, you are greeted with character creation, as with any proper roleplaying game. While it doesn't quite live up to the extensive customization options featured in Baldur's Gate 3, there is enough variety to still make your character yours. What I found disappointing was the chance to choose between only two classes. Whether this was just for this early access or a permanent feature, I'm unsure at the moment. Regardless, instead of choosing the tech themed class, I went for the Voodoo class. Anything with magic or necromancy is always up my alley, and I won't pass up an opportunity to play it. The other main gripe I had with character creation was the inability to zoom in on your character's face, meaning you can't tweak the fine details exactly how you'd like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Getting into the prologue of the game, I was stunned by how beautiful the game was. It felt like a mix between BioShock Infinite and Disco Elysium, and I was all here for it. It reproduced the entirely underrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steampunk fantasy setting</a> through a highly immersive dystopia. However, while I did enjoy the world-building throughout my time with New Arc Line, I would understand if people stopped playing during the prologue. It's a bit of a grind to get through, as your character shuffles about at a snail's pace, and there is a rather wide region to explore, especially if you like getting all the knickknacks as I do.</p>
<p>I was continuously impressed by the finer graphical details. The water was so beautifully animated and had sparkles in all the right places, which helped add to that utopia versus dystopia vibe, especially when you're first entering the New World. I liked that, to find out which of the nearby items was interactable, I could just hold down Alt, and it would highlight them, similar to the system in Baldur's Gate 3. On the flip side, the hitboxes were a little bit off. You had to have your mouse a fair amount of space away from the marker to be able to collect anything or speak with someone. During battles, this made it far too difficult, and this is where I started to lose interest.</p>
<p>The voice-acting felt fitting to New Arc Line, but it was also a tad confusing trying to guess which messages would be voice-acted. Sometimes, I was expecting the paragraph to be narrated, and it simply wasn't, with other insignificant paragraphs being narrated instead. The narration and voice-acting felt very inconsistent, as if they couldn't decide which parts should be narrated and which should be left for the player to read themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it came to battling for the first time, I didn't really enjoy the UI layout. It felt very small and cramped, and it was easy to miss details beneficial to the fight. Additionally, the hitbox issue proved to cause a lot of problems during the battle and led to my companion dying on the docks because of this. I would try to target one of the enemies, and it would very clearly hover over that specific enemy, only for my character to attack the other enemy. This happened multiple times throughout, which is what led to my companion dying, as he was taking unnecessary hits from an enemy that should have already died.</p>
<p>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed, and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. This game has a lot of potential, and you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm excited to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> studio Ubisoft Montreal is reportedly working on a new Animal Crossing-inspired social sim featuring Minecraft-like building elements, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> creative director Patrick Redding said to be at the reins.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, which claims the title - currently codenamed Alterra - has been in the works for around 18 months. Alterra is said to have risen from the ashes of an earlier Ubisoft Montreal project, canceled after four years of development, with the two games supposedly sharing a focus on voxel creation.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming's source describes Alterra as an  "Animal Crossing-inspired social sim" in which players inhabit a home island populated by NPCs known as Matterlings. These Matterlings are "somewhat like Funko Pop figures", sporting large heads and designs blending fictional and real-world creatures, from polar bears to dragons.

<p>
Alterra's social aspect is reportedly combined with that aforementioned voxel creation element, featuring building mechanics "somewhat similar" to those seen in Minecraft, with players able to fashion items using resources found out in the world beyond their home.
</p>
<p>
Here, it's claimed they'll encounter different biomes containing specific resources and different Matterling types, as well as unique enemies, materials, and more - with one example given being an ice biome, inhabited by snow-ice Matterlings, where players can create objects from snow and ice. It'll apparently be possible to encounter other players out in the world too.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming adds Ubisoft veteran Fabien Lhéraud is serving as lead producer on Alterra, and that the project's launch is "likely still a few years away".
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's release slate is, of course, a bit fuzzy beyond next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anno-117-pax-romana-is-taking-the-economic-city-builder-to-ancient-rome-next-year">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, although the publisher <em>has</em> confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">new Rayman project</a> is currently in the "exploration phase". That's alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">very long in the works Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> and Ubisoft's troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the latter now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">targeting a 2026 release</a>. In more recent news, Ubisoft has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k">launched its first-ever blockchain game</a>, featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> figurines costing up to £50k.

This third-party <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> supplement has come to Wizards of the Coast's digital TTRPG platform, bringing this adaptation of Middle-earth to more players worldwide.</p>



<p>According to an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1859-venture-into-middle-earthtm-with-free-league" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, buying <em>Lord of the Rings Roleplaying</em> on the platform conveniently provides players with rules and lore steeped in JRR Tolkien's fantasy world and built on the gameplay foundations of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</p>

It is a <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e conversion of their award-winning TTRPG, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The One Ring</a>. </em>They are a respectable TTRPG publisher thanks to a strong body of work including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-updated-dragonbane-path-of-glory-adventure" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragonbane</em></a>, and official TTRPG adaptations of <em>Alien</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>.</p>

<p>The post goes into light detail on how <em>Lord of the Rings Roleplaying</em> alters the game. First, it states that Middle-earth tales are more grounded than D&amp;D's high-fantasy heroics. In addition, player options and progression have been altered. Callings replace classes, Heroic Cultures replace species/backgrounds, and Virtues replace Feats.</p>

<p>There are also Patrons, characters that can take players under their tutelage, providing knowledge, influence, and resources. These patrons include Bilbo Baggins, Tom Bombadil, and Gandalf The Grey.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-iiis-new-dlc-launching-december-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Creative Assembly made the announcement that Total War: WARHAMMER III's newest DLC will be launching on December 12. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This DLC is named Omens of Destruction</a> and will include a ton of new content for players to get stuck into. This includes faction expansions, a new Legendary Lord, and much more. Now, let's dive into the nitty gritty about what you can expect from Total War: WARHAMMER III's DLC, Omens of Destruction.</p>
<p>Omens of Destruction focuses on expanding the factions of Khorne, Greenskins, and Ogre Kingdoms by adding new lords, heroes, and units. In addition, there will be new gameplay mechanics for players to utilize and master in Immortal Empires.</p>
<p>In addition to this content, as part of Patch 6.0 of Total War: WARHAMMER III, the 100th Legendary Lord will be added to the game as free content. This Legendary Lord is Arbaal the Undefeated, the champion of Khorne. As part of the patch, players will also see a faction update arrive in the game for the Ogre Kingdoms, Khorne, and Orcs &amp; Goblins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving on to the paid DLC content, there are three significant updates to the factions being added. First is Skulltaker, the Hero Slayer, Khorne's immortal champion and the best of all Bloodletters. With the addition of Skulltaker comes a Cloak of Skulls, which is a campaign feature. Skulltaker is tasked with seeking out enemy lords and defeating them. They excel in dueling and hunting. Along with Khorne's new champion, there will be new units to experiment with. This includes two legendary heroes named Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Orcs &amp; Goblins, players will get to play as Gorbad Ironclaw, the Brutal Unifier. He is one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses. The campaign feature for Gorbad is named Da' Plan, where you have to experiment and try to utilize unique battle tactics for your armies. Compared to Skulltaker, his playstyle is rather different. He rides into battle on his Warboar named Gnarla. He is able to close the gap between him and his enemies by charging in and using his hefty axe in close combat.&nbsp; There are new units, including the legendary hero Sngla Grobspit, as well as warriors like the Savage Orc Great Shaman and Night Goblin Big Boss.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Golgfag Maneater, the Mercenary. They are one of the most successful Ogre mercenaries of all time. In their campaign feature, you have to take on mercenary contracts where you help out your clients across the expansive Warhammer World to help settle their disputes with enemies. When Golgfag is in battle, he uses a wide variety of barbaric weaponry to secure the kills. Of course, there are also new units for the Ogres, which includes the Legendary Hero Bragg the Gutsman, as well as the Ogre Paymaster and Bruiser.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the expansive iceberg, and there are plenty more units for you to explore and utilize on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the battlefield</a> in Total War: WARHAMMER III's upcoming DLC. You don't have long to wait, as it's set to release on December 12. Make sure to check out the trailer above to see some of the content in action.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Sony launched its 30th Anniversary website for PlayStation. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website goes through</a> the console’s history from the original PlayStation through the current PlayStation 5 (PS5). It also gave confirmation of an updated number on the best-selling video game console of all time, the PlayStation 2 (PS2).</p>



<p>According to Sony, the PS2 has sold over 160 million units  since its launch in 2000. Prior to this update, the last known sales total for the console was 158.3 million units.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>The sales include original versions of the console as well us various models, including the PS2 Slim that launched in 2004.</p>



<p>At 160 million units, the PS2 widens its gap as the best-selling console ever. Behind it in the home console space is the Nintendo Switch, which as sold 146 million units. If we were to add handheld systems to the total, the PS2 sits just just six million ahead of the 154.02 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its life cycle.</p>



<p>What made the system so popular were not only the games, but the console’s ability to play DVDs as well. An all-in-one system during a time when DVDs became the norm for movie and TV show purchases made for an enticing buy for players. Obviously, the move paid off. </p>



<p>As far as the current Sony console, the PS5, Sony says that it has sold over 65 million units in its four years on the market.</p>

<p>Like a lot of children of the '80s, my early gaming nostalgia has a huge hole where the Atari 7800 might have lived. While <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">practically everyone I knew had an NES</a> during my childhood—and a few uncles and friends' older siblings even had an Atari 2600 gathering dust in their dens—I was only vaguely aware of the 7800, Atari's backward compatible, late '80s attempt to maintain relevance in the quickly changing console market.</p>
<p>Absent that kind of nostalgia, the Atari 7800+ comes across as a real oddity. Fiddling with the system's extremely cumbersome controllers and pixelated, arcade-port-heavy software library from a modern perspective is like peering into a fallen alternate universe, one where Nintendo wasn't able to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/war-stories-how-nintendo-sold-the-nes-to-a-skeptical-country/">swoop in and revive a flailing Western home video game industry</a> with the NES.</p>
<p>Even for those with fond memories of Atari 7800-filled childhoods, I'm not sure that this bare-bones package justifies its $130 price. There are many more full-featured ways to get your retro gaming fix, even for those still invested in the tail end of Atari's dead-end branch of the gaming console's evolutionary tree.</p>
<h2>7800HD</h2>
<p>Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-new-atari-2600-doesnt-justify-its-plus-sign/">last year's Atari 2600+</a>, the 7800+ shell is a slightly slimmed-down version of Atari's nostalgic hardware design. This time, Atari took design inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_7800_games#/media/File:Atari-7800-wControl-Pad-L.jpg">the rainbow-adorned European version of the 7800 console</a> (which released a year later), rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_7800_games#/media/File:Atari-7800-Console-Set.jpg">the bulkier, less colorful US release</a>.</p>

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>The 7800+ plays any of the 58 officially licensed Atari 7800 cartridges released decades ago, as well as <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/359092-atari-7800-homebrew-games-releasedcompletedwip-in-2024/">the dozens of homebrew cartridges</a> released by coders in more recent years (some of which are now being sold for $30 each by the modern Atari corporation itself; more on those later). The data on those cartridges is run via <a href="https://gstanton.github.io/ProSystem1_3/">the open source ProSystem emulator</a>, which seems more than up to the job of re-creating the relatively ancient 7800 tech without any apparent slowdown, input lag, or graphical inconsistencies. The 15 to 30 seconds of loading time when you first plug in a new cartridge is more than a bit annoying, though.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The HDMI output from the 7800+ is the updated console's main selling point, if anything is. The sharp, upscaled images work best on games with lots of horizontal and/or vertical lines and bright, single-colored sprites. But blowing up decades-old low-resolution graphics can also hurt the visual appeal of games designed to take advantage of the smoother edges and blended color gradients inherent to older cathode ray tube TVs.</p>
<p>Atari's new console doesn't offer the kind of scanline emulation or graphical filters that can help recreate that CRT glow in countless other emulation solutions (though a hardware switch does let you extend the standard 4:3 graphics to a sickeningly stretched-out 16:9). That means many of the sprites in games like <em>Food Fight</em> and <em>Fatal Run</em> end up looking like blocky riots of color when blown up to HD resolutions on the 7800+.</p>
<p>Beyond graphics, the 7800+ also doesn't offer any modern emulation conveniences like save states, fast-forward and rewind, slow-mo, controller customization, or high-score tracking across sessions. Authenticity seems to have taken precedence over modern conveniences here.</p>
<p>Much like the original Atari 7800, the 7800+ is also backward-compatible with older Atari 2600 cartridges and controllers (re-created through the able <a href="https://stella-emu.github.io/">Stella emulator</a>). That's a nice touch but also a little galling for anyone who already invested money in last year's Atari 2600+, which the company is <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-2600-plus">still selling</a> for roughly the same price as&nbsp;the 7800+. Aside from the nostalgic styling of the box itself, we can't see any reason why the less-capable 2600+ still needs to exist at all at this point.</p>
<h2>A mess of a controller</h2>
<p>In the US, the original Atari 7800 came with <a href="https://nfgworld.com/atari-7800-proline-controller-review/">an oddly designed "ProLine" joystick</a> featuring two buttons on either side of the base, designed to be hit with the thumb and index finger of your off hand. For the 7800+, Atari instead went with a controller modeled after the CX78 joypad released with the European version of the console.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This pad represents an odd inflection point in video game history, with a hard plastic thumbstick sticking out above a standard eight-way D-pad. Years before analog thumbsticks would become a console standard, this thumbstick feels incredibly fiddly for the console's completely digital directional inputs. In a game like <em>Asteroid Deluxe</em>, for instance, I found turning to the right or left frequently led to thrusting forward with an accidental "up" push as well.</p>


<p>The CX78 pad was also the first packaged Atari controller with two face buttons, a la the familiar NES controller. Unfortunately, those buttons are spaced just far enough apart to make it extremely awkward to hit both at once using a single thumb, which is practically required in newer titles like <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest</em>. The whole thing seems designed for placing the controller in front of you and hitting the buttons with two separate fingers, which I found less than convenient.</p>
<p>The Atari 7800+ does feature two standard Atari console plugs in the front, making it compatible with pretty much all classic and revamped Atari controllers (and, oddly enough, Sega Genesis pads). Be wary, though; if a 7800 game requires two buttons, a lot of single-button Atari control options will prove insufficient.</p>
<p>The CX78+'s included wireless receivers (which plug into those controller ports) mean you don't have to run any long cables from the system to your couch while playing the Atari 7800+. But a few important controls like pause and reset are stuck on the console itself—just as they were on the original Atari 7800—meaning you'll probably want to have the system nearby anyway. It would have been nice to have additional buttons for these options on the controller itself, even if that would have diminished the authenticity of the controllers.</p>

<p>Since I've never owned an Atari 7800 cartridge, Atari sent me eight titles from <a href="https://atari.com/collections/physical-cartridges?srsltid=AfmBOorngOOExe1LBDCSw3h34Zn0aefTqRMjv9ZBhi9kTKh8p8N8u33B">its current line of retro cartridges</a> to test alongside the updated hardware. This included a mix of original titles released in the '80s and "homebrew elevation" cartridges that the company says are now "getting a well-deserved official Atari release."</p>
<p>The titles I had to test were definitely a step up from the few dozen Atari 2600 games that I've accumulated and <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">grown to tolerate</a> over the years. A game like <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> on the 7800 doesn't quite match the vector graphics of the arcade original, but it comes a lot closer than the odd, colorful blobs of <em>Asteroids</em> on the 2600. The same goes for <em>Frenzy</em> on the 7800, which is a big step up from <em>Berzerk</em> on the 2600.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn't help but feel that these arcade ports are better experienced these days on one of the many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/mame-for-the-masses-legends-arcade-cabinet-could-thread-that-needle/">MAME-based</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/flurry-of-firmware-updates-makes-analogue-pocket-an-even-better-retro-handheld/">FPGA-based emulation boxes</a> that can do justice to the original quarter munchers. And the more original titles I've sampled mostly ended up feeling like pale shadows of the NES games I knew and loved.</p>
<p>The new <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest</em> (which is included with the 7800+ package) comes across as an oversimplified knock-off of <em>Adventure Island</em>, for instance. And the rough vehicular combat of <em>Fatal Run</em> is much less engaging than the NES port of Atari's own similar but superior <em>Roadblasters</em> arcade cabinet. The one exception to this rule that I found was <em>Ninja Golf</em>, a wacky, original mix of decent golfing and engaging run-and-punch combat.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not really the target audience here. The ideal Atari 7800+ buyer is someone who still has nostalgic memories of the Atari 7800 games they played as a child and has held onto at least a few of them (and/or bought more modern homebrew cartridges) in the intervening decades.</p>
<p>If those retro gamers want an authentic but no-frills box that will upscale those cartridges for an HDTV, the Atari 7800+ will do the job and look cute on your mantel while it does. But any number of emulation solutions will probably do the job just as well and with more features to boot.</p>

                <p>Activision continues to stock the Call of Duty in-game store with new bundles, and the latest lets you become a legally distinct version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Rocket Raccoon. Or at least that's what people are saying about the new "Cash Bandit" store bundle that went live today, November 26, for Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p>The bundle comes with the "Raccoon Goon" skin for Niran, along with the "Debt Collector" weapon skin for the Sirin 9mm special weapon that was recently released. There is also a "Vault Security" GPR 91 assault rifle blueprint included with the bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962"></a><figcaption>This is not Rocket Raccoon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg"></figure><p>The raccoon skin also includes a weapon reticle called "Cash Flow," along with a finishing move labeled "Disarmed." What's more, the bundle includes a raccoon-themed decal and weapon charm, as well as a one-hour double XP token. This DLC bundle costs 2,800 COD Points, which is about $20 USD.</p><p>This isn't the first Call of Duty store bundle that bears a resemblance to a Guardians of the Galaxy character.

This is more than just a brand-new map for Zombies in Black Ops 6, as Citadelle des Morts represents a key development in the ongoing Zombies narrative, as it merges some of the existing Treyarch storylines that had previously been unconnected. Here's what you need to know before the map arrives on December 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The final storyline cutscene for the Terminus map throws a bunch of names at you, and if you haven't played Black Ops 4 or Vanguard Zombies, these mentions may not mean anything to you, but for longtime fans this connects all of the stories in an intriguing way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Citadelle des Morts Zombies Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some spoilers ahead:</strong> The final Terminus cinematics reveals that Edward Richtofen has been seeking Prima Materia and the Sentinel Artifacts, which are the main elements of Treyarch's Chaos storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 introduced a completely new set of Zombies characters for the Chaos storyline, which, until now, has been unconnected to the Aether storyline that involves the original Zombies cast of Edward Richtofen, Takeo Masaki, Tank Dempsey, and Nikolai Belinsk. Black Ops 4's cast of Chaos characters chased down Sentinel Artifacts, which were relics created by an Earth-mined substance known as Prima Materia.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 4, Prima Materia is revealed as a substance that brought so much power that it corrupted and destroyed whole civilizations. It's no shock that Richtofen is seeking this kind of power, but it could have a catastrophic outcome if he gains possession of a Sentinel Artifact. It's also revealed that a Sentinel Artifact might be able to harness the power needed to bring back Samantha Maxis from the Dark Aether. Samantha Maxis sacrificed herself in the final cutscene for Black Ops Cold War Zombies in order to seal the Dark Aether breach and stop the Zombies boss called the Forsaken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957"></a><figcaption>The Terminus cutscene's mention of a Sentinel Artifact</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Terminus cutscene also tells us that Richtofen hired a French syndicate to help him find a Sentinel Artifact. This syndicate is led by Franco Moreau, and he has employed the help of Sergei Ravenov, who has abducted a man named Gabriel Krafft to interrogate for knowledge on the artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">This part of the cutscene drops some interesting names, yet it's also a little confusing. Chronologically, Sergei Ravenov was last seen helping members of the Terminus crew stop the Outbreak incursions in Black Ops Cold War. Gabriel Krafft, on the other hand, was a demonologist in Vanguard Zombies who studied these Sentinel Artifacts. He was shown as a very old man during the time of World War II, so it will be interesting to see how the story explains he is sill alive in 1991. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861441696099115196" rel="nofollow ">Treyarch even teases this</a> for the trailer reveal, referring to Krafft as "the man who should not be alive." Maybe Kraftt has resorted to using some kind of relic for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">The mystery of Kraftt's survival and the chase for a Sentinel Artifact makes Season 1 of Black Ops an exciting time to be a Zombies fan. We'll now be playing as the Terminus crew, who are headed to a castle in Europe to rescue Vanguard's Gabriel Krafft from a dangerous syndicate in order to help locate Black Ops 4's Sentinel Artifact before the powerful relic gets in the hands of Edward Richtofen. The Terminus crew not only wants to stop Richtofen, but now they're looking to use the power for themselves in order to bring Samantha Maxis back.</p><p dir="ltr">The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">cinematic trailer for Citadelle des Morts can be viewed here</a>, which shows the Terminus crew have now fled the prison island, and they've reconnected with Sergei Ravenov. They ask him to turn against the French syndicate, explaining to him that Krafft might know how to bring Samantha back.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more story and map details closer to launch. In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include Perk-a-Cola, a new field upgrade, a new ammo mod, and more Augments to unlock. The map's main story quest will also go live simultaneously with the launch.</p>
