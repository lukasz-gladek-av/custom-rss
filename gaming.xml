		<p>CI Games has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> Version 2.0, a huge update to the game that brings improvements to combat, characters, adds shared progression in co-op, and also introduces a free Friend’s Pass scheme to the game.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone update, the game is at steep 67-72% discount through the PlayStation Spring Sale until 23rd April, until 24th April on Epic, and until 1st May on Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - VERSION 2.0 (Free Friend’s Pass, Shared Progression Co-op) | PC, PS5, Xbox X|S" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the free Friend’s Pass, you need to purchase just one copy of the game in order to play co-op, inviting any other person that you like to join, much like the same scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction</a>. A special Friend’s Pass version of the game is now available across PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5, giving offline access to the tutorial and character creator, and also allowing for full crossplay co-op.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the shared progression in co-op now saves all main story progress for both players that start a new game together, so long as you’ve defeated a similar number of main bosses. Both players retain their loot, 100% vigor and can revive one another in an online session. The previous co-op progression style is also retained, if you prefer that.</p>

<p>Read more about the nitty-gritty of how this works in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLordsOfTheFallen/comments/1k1g6bk/lotf_v20_coop_faq/">FAQ on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>These are already pretty significant additions, but CI Games has continued to iterate on the gameplay since the last update, version 1.7, was released in December. Version 2.0 has revamped combat and movement with smoother animations, weapon response, lock-on, evasions and more. There’s now a dedicated jump button for improved platforming, too.</p>
<p>The character creator has been overhauled, leading into an improved tutorial, and there’s a modernised UI and HUD through the game as well.</p>
<p>“Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates” said Marek Tymninski, CEO of CI Games. “The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.”</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen underwhelmed upon its original release in 2023, despite having its intriguing twinned world mechanic and looking to be a more distinctive game than the 2014 title that it supplanted. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review/">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, Jason said, “I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</p>
<p>A sequel is in development, with an expected release in 2026, so it’s high time that CI Games wrap up the continued support of this title and put their full focus onto the next game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/what-we-played-atomfall-south-of-midnight-my-friend-peppa-pig/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While we all look ahead to gorging ourselves on chocolate eggs in a few days time, the short week and extra long weekend will also give plenty time for playing more games than usual. That’s what the future holds, but what about the past? What have we all been playing the last seven days?</p>
<p>There’s been an awful lot of Blue Prince being played in my house, but not by me outside of when I helped with a light switching puzzle. Instead, I’ve made the smallest of starts on Xenoblade Chronicles 2, finally getting round to a game that I must have bought about 6 years ago now, and I’ve touched on a couple games for preview in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Dom’s been away all week on holiday, taking his Switch and 3DS along for company – no doubt hoping to snag a StreetPass visitor or two on his travels – though he’s not actually told me what, if anything, he’s managed to play. So I’m going to suggest that they’ve spent the whole week playing Mario Party games.</p>
<p>Aran has found himself managing Promise Mascot Agency, and as he nears the end of the story, he says that Pinky is likely to go down as the best supporting character of this year – something that Pinky and the Brain fans would certainly agree on.</p>

<p>Sticking with the A’s, Ade has played more Atomfall while he takes a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He’s had fun playing a spot of “Danger Cricket”, as I’m calling it, knocking away thrown grenades with his cricket bat, and generally having a lovely time in the Lake District. He’s also made a return to Helldivers 2.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, has not taken a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, eliminating a few more targets from&nbsp;Yasuke and Naoe’s naughty lists – “I’m not particularly fond of the game’s ever-expanding objective board which seems to sprout new quests every time you look away, though it does give me plenty to do while travelling between story mission markers.”</p>
<p>Alongsdie that, his daughter is getting more interested in video games, so they’ve been playing My Friend Peppa Pig and Cars 3.</p>
<p>It’s been a bit of Hogwarts Legacy and Terraria for Gamoc, as he’s now wrapped up the main story of the former, while Miguel has been playing&nbsp; Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, a bunch of The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, and a little pinch of Blue Prince.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with Steve:</p>
<p>“This week I have played through South of Midnight which I absolutely loved, and took your advice by downloading the soundtrack which has got plenty of repeat plays. I also continued my Sisyphean quest to 100% Lego Skywalker Saga which is ongoing (perhaps eternally). Got lost in Metroid Dread so waiting til I can play it docked for a clearer view of the map. Did manage to deflect one EMMI attack which made me feel like a boss until I got myself stuck in a dead end and was killed immediately after… Finally, I’ve played a couple of small indie games for review.”</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What have you played this week, and what do you have in store for the doubly long weekend?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polaris Quest, a Chinese development studio owned by Tencent, has published a new gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram, the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks a bit too much like Guerrilla's Horizon franchise</a>. Truth be told, there are some gameplay differences. Whereas the Horizon games are action/adventure titles with some light RPG elements thrown in for good measure, Light of Motiram is mostly a survival game where players must establish a base and defend it. The building system will be based on a realistic physics engine.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a lot of emphasis on taming the over a hundred types of 'Mechanimals'. Each comes with unique skills and growth potential. Players can assign Mechanimals different combat modes and production traits. Combat itself also seems more centered on melee with dodging, blocking, and counterattacking moves. Moreover, Light of Motiram includes seamless cooperative multiplayer throughout the whole game, something that Horizon games have lacked so far - although Guerrilla Games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on Horizon Online</a>, a co-op game that is the Dutch studio's next big thing. Sure, it's hard to shake the visual similarities, which are definitely more than just inspirations.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | Outcast Forest Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vi-jR03vkPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, it won't be long before Light of Motiram becomes available for everyone to check out. Polaris Quest plans to launch it in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android as a free-to-play game. You can find the system requirements below.</p>

			<p>During the Galaxies Showcase, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms published a new trailer for the Painkiller reboot. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late March at the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024 for a release scheduled later this year.</p>
<p>In the new Painkiller game, players will use these seven weapons to slay all sorts of demons and foes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrodriver: Barrage enemies with rapid-firing shurikens that bounce off hard surfaces.</li>
<li>Stakegun: Hurls high-damage stakes that can impale foes from long-range.</li>
<li>SMG: Unleashes loads of ammo in short, rapid-fire bursts.</li>
<li>Handcannon: Decimate enemies from long range with deadly precision.</li>
<li>Shotgun: Spits destructive pellets at short range that can damage and stagger multiple foes.</li>
<li>Rocket Launcher: Discharges a rocket projectile with a devastating blast radius that can stagger even heavy enemies.</li>
<li>Painkiller: a versatile weapon with a brutal melee attack that hooks onto enemies, shreds them to pieces, and refills your ammo.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dUKtbucEOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this reboot, players must choose between four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. Each comes with unique perks and boosts to energy, health, power, or damage. Tarot cards can be used to enhance character abilities and even combined with those of other players. Indeed, the addition of cooperative multiplayer is arguably the greatest change compared to the original. We'll have to wait and see if the game can retain its signature gameplay even when playing with others.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-fantasy-action-game-covenant-gets-new-trailer.1167654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-fantasy-action-game-covenant-gets-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Showcase, independent developer Legion Studio shared the second official trailer for Covenant, an upcoming first-person dark fantasy action game. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Covenant is being developed by a 12-person team with industry credits in big franchises like Call of Duty, DOOM, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Destiny, and Halo.</p>
<p>Players will step into the role of a warrior angel sent from the Heavens into Creation to follow in the steps of the fallen angel Malach. According to Legion, this mythical land is designed to be fully interconnected, just like in a Soulslike game. Because of this, puzzles, riddles, platforming, and exploration are going to be part of the player's journey. Discovering shortcuts and seeking out hidden paths will be the key to uncovering every secret.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is the core of the game. The developers said they have put a lot of emphasis on melee combat, which was inspired by fighting games (Tekken, Smash Bros), immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Dishonored), and action games (Dark Souls). There are even different stances that change the player character's entire fighting style, down to the way they run, jump, kick, and slide. Each of the stances drastically modifies the play style. Magic will also play a key role in complementing the build crafting, strategy, and creativity that players will be able to exhibit.</p>
<p>Covenant will support co-op multiplayer as well as competitive multiplayer in dedicated 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game is said to be still in early development. Legion said they'd like to avoid going into early access, but it may become necessary at some point if the studio needs financial help (they are currently seeking a publisher). They would also wish to port their game to consoles, but for now, they can only promise the PC version, which can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Why settle for one kind of horror story when you can explore them all? That's the TLDR behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/video-ghastlies/" data-ref-id="5000-672518">Video Ghastlies</a>, an upcoming horror game that sees players pulled into many different eras of horror movie history, from 1930s gothic horror and Carpenteresque body horror to Giallo slashers and even modern styles like found footage. The game doesn't have a release date just yet, but it'll debut on PC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SZc_Y6ULv8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5SZc_Y6ULv8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Video Ghastlies is set in 1990s Scotland, casting players as the sibling of a missing brother. To find him, you'll explore illegal VHS tapes, with each one pulling you into a different horror story. In between, your apartment acts as a safe haven where you can put clues together and try to solve a multilayered mystery. </p><p>The game doesn't intend to be a defenseless horror game akin to Amnesia or Outlast. Instead, you'll be equipped with weapons befitting of each era and genre you're pulled into, with puzzles to slow you down and enemies staring back at you.</p><p>Video Ghastlies can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3399290/Video_Ghastlies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted on Steam</a>.

Thoughts might be turning toward <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> 2 - and developer FuturLab has now shared a fresh look at its recently announced hose-'em-up sequel - but the original also just got another free update, letting hardened sprayers unload their nozzle somewhere new.
</p>
<p>
Starting with PowerWash Simulator 2, FuturLab's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH6DJo5Ou3E">latest trailer</a> provides a whistlestop tour of the sequel's new features, which include a fruity truck, a new furnishable HQ, split-screen co-op, and more. It doesn't say much we didn't already know, admittedly, but once you've watched the trailer you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">delve a little deeper into the sequel</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
But if you're looking for something new to hose in the more immediate term, there's The Muckingham Files 5. This latest free update for the original PowerWash Simulator introduces Muckingham's Dessert Parlour, where players will be assisting Gemma Smetana by bringing the building's sugar-blasted interior back to a gleaming sheen.

<p>
"You'll be tasked with tackling this sticky mess of cake, ice cream, and jam," FuturLab explains, "to transform this local hangout to its former treat filled glory."
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free The Muckingham Files 5 update - which follows on from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1290000/announcements/detail/542229141158625303">February's paid Wallace &amp; Gromit DLC</a> - is available now on all platforms. And despite the looming presence of PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently set to arrive later this year, FuturLab still isn't done with the original. According to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1290000/announcements/detail/542229141158625303">studio's 2025 PowerWash Simulator 1 roadmap</a>, two free updates are due this year, meaning we're one down and one to go.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe stayed atop the Nintendo Switch sales charts undefeated for years, and still stands as the top-selling game on Switch and in the Mario Kart series. Nintendo is clearly trying to capture that lightning in a bottle again for its follow-up console, with a new Mario Kart ready to speed off the starting block alongside the system. And with that premium offering comes a premium price: $80, a price tag that leapfrogs over the somewhat expected $70 price for next-gen games.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo took the wraps off of Mario Kart World as part of its Switch 2 presentation, the price was a major point of conversation. And more specifically: What made this game demand such a high asking price? When asked, Nintendo's answer was essentially that the proof was in the pudding--that once we saw all it had to offer, the reason behind the increased price would become apparent.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World - Full Gameplay Overview Nintendo Direct Presentation | Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We'll look at varying prices and things like that for software based off of just how robust the experience is," Nintendo's Bill Trinen told us in an interview in early April. "People will get to learn more about that game. And I think that as they start to learn more about that game, they're going to be pretty excited about the content that's offered there."</p><p dir="ltr">In that same answer, he even specifically pointed out that a special Nintendo Direct was coming focused solely on Mario Kart World. So now that the Nintendo Direct has debuted, it's fair to ask: Did the presentation deliver on the value proposition? Did the features of this new game retroactively justify the price tag?</p><p dir="ltr">How you spend your gaming dollars is a personal decision, so answers will certainly vary. But it's difficult to say that today's presentation, positioned as the place to "learn more about the game" and open our eyes to the value proposition, made a particularly strong case that this Mario Kart game has a much larger scope than others in the series, or even much beyond what we already knew from the first hands-on session at the Switch 2 reveal event.</p><p dir="ltr">At the reveal event, we learned that Mario Kart World features a huge open world that you can freely explore in Free Roam mode, and that in addition to the standard Grand Prix there would be a new Knockout Tour mode that eliminates players progressively along checkpoints. The roster is bigger to accommodate the new larger player count, 24 racers at a time, and racers can unlock a wide variety of costumes to greatly vary their looks. Mario Kart World is also positioned as a showpiece for the new GameChat feature, which has been featured heavily as friends hang out and trash-talk as they explore the races.</p><p dir="ltr">So what did we learn about Mario Kart World today? We learned that in addition to the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battle-mode-is-back-in-mario-kart-world-two-minigames-confirmed/1100-6530930/">Battle Mode is coming back</a> with two competitive modes. We learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/">Free Roam will have collectibles and secrets</a> to find, though how you're rewarded for finding them is still a little unclear. And we got a look at some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/">new characters</a>, got more clarity on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-how-eating-meals-and-unlocking-costumes-works/1100-6530926/">how to unlock costumes</a>, and learned about new tricks and abilities like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-lets-players-rewind-if-they-make-a-mistake/1100-6530929/">rewind feature</a>. The presentation even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-roads-return-in-mario-kart-world-is-all-but-confirmed/1100-6530927/">teased the return of Rainbow Road</a> as a reward for finishing the other Grand Prix races, which isn't exactly surprising but does pique our curiosity. What will this new version of the iconic track look like? All in all it was a good, comprehensive overview of a big launch game.</p><p dir="ltr">But in terms of new content, there just wasn't much there. Battle Mode is a nice addition but it was never the main draw of Mario Kart games. The Free Roam missions could be hiding more depth than we realize, but it's hard to tell based on what we learned today. There was no sense of an increased scope with more Grand Prix races or a live service approach to post-launch content. Our understanding of Mario Kart World isn't significantly different today than it was yesterday, so it's hard to conclude that this presentation answered the lingering questions we all had when we first heard the price.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems the most likely explanation for the price is the one given by Serkan Toto shortly after the announcement: Nintendo is pricing Mario Kart World at $80 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-80-because-thats-what-people-will-pay-for-it-analyst-says/1100-6530715/">because people will pay $80</a> for it. It's a big launch game, it looks gorgeous, it's the successor to one of Nintendo's top-sellers, and it will continue to sell for years into the Switch 2 lifespan. Nintendo is pricing it aggressively, but not beyond what consumers are probably willing to pay. That's capitalism, baby.</p><p dir="ltr">And in fairness to Nintendo, it is offering consumers a break if they wish to take it. The Switch 2 bundle with a digital copy of Mario Kart World is only $50 more than the standard bundle, making it significantly less costly than buying a new game a la carte, even on the original Switch. That <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/">bundle is only available through the end of the year</a>, though, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">preorders haven't opened yet in the US</a>. We'll have to see how readily available the bundle will be.</p><p>To be clear, Mario Kart World looks great. It's visually stunning, the open-world aspect seems ambitious, the roster is a delightful who's-who for longtime Nintendo fans, and most importantly, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/">just a blast to play</a>. I'm going to get it as soon as I can, and I'm going to play the hell out of it. All of us Nintendo fans will, and that's just the point. Nintendo is charging a premium for a great-looking game because it knows it looks great. The Nintendo Direct didn't deliver some shocking degree of content that suddenly makes the $80 make sense, because it doesn't really need to. It's Mario Kart's world, and we're just living in it.</p>

Pricing starts at just $5, and gets you two games: <strong>Gato Roboto</strong>, which sees you exploring a high-tech facility as a mech-piloting cat, and <strong>Monster Sanctuary</strong>, which mixes Pokemon-inspired monster taming and turn-based battles with Metroidvania-style sidescrolling exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">At $10, you'll get three more games, including <strong>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</strong>, which is the fifth game in the Shantae series and notable for its hand-drawn in-game visuals and cutscenes. You'll also get the <strong>Islets</strong>, a charming adventure set in a world of floating islands, as well as <strong>Astalon: Tears of the Earth</strong>, which is inspired by side-scrolling action RPGs of the late 80s like Legacy of the Wizard and Xanadu--an often overlooked segment of the Metroidvania genre's history.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $14, you'll get the full eight-game bundle, which gets you all of the previously mentioned games, plus the Dark Souls-inspired <strong>Grime</strong>, the fast-paced action platformer <strong>Berserk Boy</strong> (which we should note is closer to Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero than a true Metroidvania), and <strong>BioGun</strong>, which is a 2024 release with a vibrant art style reminiscent of Hollow Knight and gameplay inspired by classic 2D shooters.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4478710-biogun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4478710" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4478710-biogun.png" data-ref-id="1300-4478710"></a><figcaption>BioGun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4478710-biogun.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">All eight games are delivered as official Steam keys. Almost all of the games are fully playable on Steam Deck, too, with the sole exception of BioGun--it's <em>playable, </em>but has very noticeable performance issues and requires tinkering with the controls.

            <p>
As part of tonight's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, developer Remedy Entertainment has shown off a little more of its upcoming three-player co-op Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, with a more substantial reveal now confirmed to be airing next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak, for the uninitiated, casts players as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak division, a team of volunteer first responders charged with roaming the ever-changing Oldest House and keeping its unconfined paranatural anomalies in check.
</p>
<p>
When last we saw FBC: Firebreak, Remedy was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">showing off a mission involving a rampant spread of sentient Post-It notes</a>, but its latest trailer - which maintains the same quippy tone - goes all in on rampaging furnaces and an outbreak of pink exploding goo (AKA Exogenic Mass) as players attempt to regain control of the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector.
</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
These are just two more of the otherworldly hazards players may face as their team embarks on new Jobs at the behest of FBC uppermanagement, each chaotic mission taking them to different areas of the Oldest House - some familiar and some new - and featuring different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak already looks to offer a promising extradimensional twist on the co-operative shooter - and one mercifully free of time-sucking live-service trappings, at that - and it's set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this "summer". However, those eager to learn more about Remedy's latest can tune into a <a href="http://twitch.tv/remedygames">special Twitch livestream</a> at 6pm BST/10am PDT next Thursday, 24th April, when the studio is promising "brand new content and exciting news".
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak isn't the only game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">currently in the works at Remedy</a>, of course. It's also collaborating with Rockstar to remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2, and there'll be more opportunity to revisit the Oldest House away from FBC: Firebreak thanks to fully fledged sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.

            <p>
Look, I'm sorry, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> has the best hook of any game ever. As the headline notes, this is a game where music is illegal, and you do crimes. It's a rhythm game, no less, which it couldn't really be anything else but that, right? I've been waiting for it for about four years now, since the Kickstarter launched, and unfortunately it's still not quite ready yet. However! As of today, the next best thing is here: a demo.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"A demo? Doesn't Unbeatable already have one of those?" I hear you ask. Yes, it's had a couple in fact, but this one's a proper one, the kind that actually lets you play a vertical slice of the game so you can really get a feel for it. Earlier demos were mostly about trying out the game's rhythm mechanics, whereas this one, which was paired with yet another incredibly sharp new trailer, lets you roam around a bit. There is some rhythm gaming to be done of course, just not only to songs.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwKFOZeJukA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
There's a couple places in the demo where you can just jam out to the sound of the beat of the world, making improvised songs to the beat of a vending machine, or the sound of seagulls. You'll also make and hang-up posters to plaster across police recruitment flyers, and, oh, you do fight cops too, because they suck (and again, music is illegal, you do crimes, etc.). There's a baseball minigame for heaven's sake! I'm not sure if I need to explain much more how compelling this demo is.
</p>
<p>
But I will anyway, because the cherry on top is that there's a Y2K as hell arcade mode now too, completely focused on the rhythm game side of it all, which I'm infinitely obsessed with already. Who knew games could look this good!
</p>
<p>
It's a really comprehensive demo that, if I weren't already positioning this as my future game of the year, would absolutely convince me to pick it up at launch. No go, be away with you, commit a felony to some sick tunes, that's an order, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> to make things easier for you.

<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Covenant casts you as a warrior angel, coming down to exact martial arts vengeance on those who stand in your way, creatures from fallen empires that remain.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of blurb:</p>
<p><i>Experience Creation through the eyes of the last living messenger – a warrior angel sent to carry out the will of the Composers. The oldest of your kind, Malach, has fallen to the abyss – leaving in his wake a trail of destruction. You must follow in the footsteps of his final days in order to uncover the nature of his fall – and in doing so, reveal the slumbering forces hidden within Creation.</i></p>

<p>Featuring an interconnected Soulslike world that is punctuated by major boss battles, the hook here is that you’re playing in first person, using different fighting stances, spells and weapons in battle. Adaptability is key here, where different stances completely overhaul your fighting style, down to the way that you jump and kick, which is mixed with the variety of weapons available to you. These can, similar to Bloodborne, be used in a 1-hand and 2-hand form, making you more powerful but less mobile.</p>
<p>Player progression comes from crafting and applying upgrades in ring slots, while weapons are upgraded, spells grow stronger and new stances are discovered.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting sounding game with a mix of Soulslike and first person quite a distinctive one. We’re keen to see how this comes together.</p>
