The feature, powered by Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, provides two 30-minute trial sessions per week to Discord users who don’t have Fortnite installed on their PC.</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> trial will be available until October 30th, with sessions updated every Tuesday at 9:59AM ET, according to Epic’s announcement. You can access the demos by <a href="https://fortnitetrial.fortnite.com/en-US/">clicking the sign-up link</a> on Epic’s announcement page, which will then redirect you to Discord. Availability is limited to PC players in the US, UK, Mexico, Canada, and several European countries. However, it’s worth flagging that myself and another UK-based colleague were unable to launch the experience in Discord without using a VPN that connected to the US.</p><p>There are no requirements to install <em>Fortnite</em> to play the demos, but users need to be signed into both their Discord and Epic Games accounts to connect them for the trial. Epic says that it doesn’t share players’ data with Nvidia or Discord, but notes that the companies “may independently” collect it. The <em>Fortnite</em> trials are the first of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760894/play-instantly-on-discord-fortnite-will-be-nvidia-try-before-you-buy-geforce-now">Nvidia and Discord’s instant game demo experiments</a>, which may enable Discord users to instantly try out other titles in the future.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/795897/epic-fortnite-discord-instant-game-demo-availability]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-1-600-robot-vacuum-is-now-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-quietly-clearing-out-all-its-stock.1319419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums have evolved far beyond the basic “bump-and-spin” models that once dominated store shelves at budget prices. Roborock has firmly planted itself in the luxury segment of this market, where several of their flagship models now command $1,500 or more. These aren’t machines you can compare to the $200 to $400 entry-level options still available at big-box stores. The difference becomes obvious the moment you watch one work:<strong> genuine autonomy, intelligent navigation, and cleaning performance that replaces human effort</strong> rather than simply supplementing it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Saros 10R</a> embodies everything that separates premium robot vacuums from their cheaper cousins, handling everything from self-emptying to obstacle avoidance with sophistication that justifies its positioning. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Prime Big Deal Day has brought this model down to $1,199 from its standard $1,599 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes luxury-tier automated cleaning more accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering Excellence That Cleans Deeper</h2>
<p>The Roborock Saros 10R’s 3.14-inch ultra-slim profile represents a fundamental design shift enabled by the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0, which eliminates the raised LiDAR dome that makes traditional robot vacuums too tall to fit under most furniture. This<strong> system uses 3D sensing technology to map your home with precision</strong>, even navigating under narrow-legged furniture and suspended cabinets where dust accumulates undisturbed for months in typical homes.</p>
<p>The VertiBeam lateral obstacle avoidance system illustrates the intelligence gap between this vacuum and low-end robots: It <strong>recognizes and avoids 108 distinct types of obstructions</strong>, including charging cables that would futilely entangle low-end models. It can also vacuum along cords without the need for you to prep your floors, and removes the ironic task that is cleaning before your new robotic vacuum can vacuum.</p>



<p>Cleaning power comes from <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction that pulls embedded dirt from carpet fibers</strong> and extracts debris from tile grout lines with equal effectiveness. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush solves the persistent problem of hair wrapping around rollers, a design that handles long human hair and pet fur without creating the tangled mess that forces you to manually cut away accumulated strands.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm</em> riser technology introduces <strong>extendable side brushes and extendable mops</strong> that reach into the corners and edges, beyond the reach of the fixed-position tools that leave messes behind. As the robot senses the presence of a corner or edge, the arms extend automatically to sweep and mop the spaces that would have had to be done manually. This dynamic response closes the cleaning gaps that leave cheaper robots incomplete.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis represents industry-first engineering that Roborock pioneered, and <strong>allows the robot to climb obstacles up to 4cm high</strong> including door thresholds and navigate around U-shaped furniture legs that trap conventional robots. When carpets are detected, the dual spinning mops and their bracket lift automatically to prevent soaking your rugs, then lower again on hard floors for mopping.</p>
<p>The dock 4.0 handles the unglamorous but essential maintenance tasks automatically: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water that dissolves grease and sanitizes the fabric, then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew. The <strong>60-day automatic dust collection</strong> means you empty the dock’s collection bin roughly six times per year instead of after every cleaning session.</p>
<p>At the price of $1,199 for Prime Day on Amazon, you’re spending money on everyday convenience that is truly luxurious, although <strong>this Prime-member exclusive offer ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is nearly over, but that isn’t stopping fans from arguing about whether multiplayer is better with Open or Closed Weapon classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and the four-company team at Battlefield Studios will let loose their new entry in the large-scale military shooter series this Friday, October 10, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed">find out when, exactly, here</a>). Along with a new campaign, guns, gadgets, and maps, the developers behind Battlefield 6 have told fans to look forward to a return to form following the disappointment that was Battlefield 2042.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta and Battlefield Labs players have largely come away excited for what Battlefield 6 promises, but the debate surrounding Open and Closed Weapons is the main thing on fans’ minds just two days out from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation picked up when players went hands-on during the August Battlefield 6 beta tests. While many past Battlefield games feature Closed Weapons – a design decision that locks classes to a specific set of guns – many were surprised to see the new Battlefield game add and prioritize an option for Open Weapons, which largely removes gun restrictions between classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Open style is similar to the system used in Battlefield 2042, but it’s not the bad taste in players’ mouths that has them bickering. Closed Weapons defenders argue these restrictions encourage players to not only think on their feet but also rely on teamwork, a key element for many longtime fans of the series. The system could also pour cold water on meta gameplay strategies that could result in an unbalanced number of players relying on one particularly powerful gun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those on the other side of the fence feel Open Weapons offer players of all skill levels more freedom to craft a loadout that fits their playstyles while rewarding those who choose specific loadouts. Though perhaps not quite as vocal, there are plenty of players who feel Open loadouts are the way to go – and BF Studios agrees.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Studios Says Players Prefer Open Weapons</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Debate continued up to earlier this week, when BF Studios offered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-day-one-patch-includes-changes-to-movement-weapon-recoil-rush-and-more"><u>a pre-release breakdown for its Battlefield 6 launch day plans</u></a>, previewing the contents of its day one patch for those looking forward to in-game changes following post-beta feedback. It came hand-in-hand with confirmation that data pointed to “a vast majority of players” preferring the Open system more than the Closed system after trying both options between different playlists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6,” the message from BF Studios says. “At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter how loud fans of the Closed method are, BF Studios is adamant that players mostly gravitate toward an Open system, even if Battlefield 6 will continue to support both options. Meanwhile, many have used this latest update only as fuel to continue their mission to see this week’s new Battlefield game shift its focus to the Closed system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their argument revolves around the notion that open beta players only favored Open Weapons because relevant playlist options are the first to appear on the Battlefield 6 multiplayer menu screen. So, the idea is, if your average player, who is unfamiliar with the discourse, boots up the game, they’ll need to dig for a Closed option, resulting in skewed data.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a criticism many are leaning on that EA and BF Studios have already stepped in to stomp out. Lead Battlefield producer at DICE David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975264910285459695" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> to explain how the team came to their conclusion. He addresses the argument that Closed playlist options were hidden from players, reminding displeased fans that playlist and mode tiles often moved around, and their data accounted for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes they moved around alot, as you may have noticed,” Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975266470260273583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said in response</u></a> to a fan asking for clarification. “We did this to all tiles, [Conquest] vs [Breakthrough] etc. See how much tile placement impact pick rates and how single mode vs playlist with multiple modes differed, etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland’s explanation still hasn’t quite quelled the uproar, as one third of the Battlefield 6 community demands more answers while another third is voicing their support for Open playlists more than ever. That final third mostly just wants the fighting to come to an end.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Brutal truth:</p><p>Casuals won’t care about Closed Weapons. Or Open Weapons. Or even what weapon they’re using most of the time.</p><p>They just wanna play Battlefield 👍 <a href="https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl</a></p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1975283650351800824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Preparing for Launch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As BF Studios and EA barrel toward the launch of Battlefield 6, disgruntled fans continue to take to comment sections across social media to ask the developers to give Closed playlists more time in the spotlight. Complaints and memes poking fun at the situation have flooded Reddit, in particular, with many replies from users calling out debaters as simply being a vocal minority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would be surprised if the open vs closed weapon debate represents more than 10% of players,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4jbd3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment said</u></a>. “I think 10% is being very generous lol,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4qvr5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6, Open vs Closed <a href="https://t.co/hffyEz2npw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hffyEz2npw</a></p>— IT'S REAL.

At the time, senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said the team didn’t want to “make a decision or really pigeonhole” how players experience Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s ongoing, and I think it’ll continually evolve, but again, from a design side, we don’t want to make a decision for the player base at the end of the day,” Nickerson added. “We want to support both moving forward, and again, a key mantra for Battlefield 6 is, ‘Play Battlefield how you want to,’ so we’re making sure we support both open and closed systems. We just don’t want to make the decision for the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if EA and BF Studios have any plans to address the Open vs. Closed Weapons debate further ahead of the launch of Battlefield 6. With the recent acknowledgment reaffirming its commitment to the Open system while reassuring players that Closed options will remain available, it seems unlikely BF Studios will change course anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on our time with the Battlefield 6 beta, we’ve got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Battlefield_6_Beta_Beginner%27s_Guide_and_Tips">BF6 Beginner’s Guide and Tips</a>, plus the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Best_BF6_Loadouts">best Battlefield 6 Loadouts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Range_Finder_Explained">how to use the Range Finder</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Deploy_Bipod">deploy the Bipod</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Turn_Off_Haptic_Feedback">how to turn off Haptic Feedback in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Of course, all of these goodies do ramp up the price slightly, so you're looking at $79.99 for the Full Force Edition. The standard, meanwhile, is a bit more forgiving at $39.99. Limited Run Games has also clarified that this won't be a numbered release, so if you're looking for a full LRG set, missing out on this one won't be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports. What are your thoughts on FIFA 23 shutting down its servers this month? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<figure data-uuid="72fca9445ef7b"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/72fca9445ef7b/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>We had a blast with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> when it arrived on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this summer, but we can all agree that it was missing something, right? Something like, we don't know, bingo?</p>
<p>Well, Marvelous has answered the call and has added exactly that in the new ver. 1.1.0 update. Yes, 'Happy Bingo' is the big addition this time around, giving you the daily chance to fill out an activity card and win a prize. You'll need to have reached 'City Bazaar Rank' or higher to unlock the new mode, but with that out of the way, it's bingo a-go-go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436npowhk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Here's a little more information about the new mode from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2508780/view/499459531596630810">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve updated the game and reached “City Bazaar Rank,” the Nature Sprites will visit during an event cut scene introducing “Happy Bingo.” Each spot on the card features an everyday activity like fishing or petting animals. Players complete these activities to fill spots on their card until they’ve completed a Happy Bingo! Players then turn in completed cards at the Nature Sprites’ stall, Happy Shoppe, on bazaar days to earn a variety of useful items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's not just bingo, either. Marvelous has thrown a handful of other fixes and tweaks into this update, all of which were shared in an update post on Steam. We've collected these patch notes together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Ver. 1.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bingo features added<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue resulting in a rare game crash<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where dismounting from horse would reset bag color to default outfit settings<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where pet food bowl would stop functioning properly after rehoming a pet<br></li>
<li>Adjusted select BGM and sound effect volume<br></li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
<li>Addressed Unity security vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While we had a few small issues with the fishing and sheer number of gameplay systems, we called Grand Bazaar "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 8/10 review</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-about-humiliation-but-the-joy-of-disobedient-flesh">Falling over is the thing</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. Sure, the goal in Bennett Foddy and co's walking sim is technically getting from A to B despite your doughy corpus' best efforts to get in the way, but it's the constant stumbling and hilarious unintended pratfalls which make these sorts of games really sing. You get plenty of that playing alone, but for those who want to take things to the next level, Baby Steps has a multiplayer mod that'll let you slap against your mates and gently bump their mushy forms off course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/babysteps/mods/1?tab=description">Baby Steps multiplayer mod</a> by Caleb Orchard has only just hit Nexus Mods, it's already been through several early iterations on <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client">GitHub</a> and even <a href="https://x.com/bfod/status/1971393914574962710">gotten the approval of Foddy himself</a>.</p>
<p>With it installed, rather than taking on the life of a failson with misbehaving limbs alone, you and a gang of others can run around in a range of different coloured onesies. Your gang of badly coordinated Teletubbies can collide with each other if you enable that setting and as you can see in the video below, the result is the possibility to send someone skidding down a cliff or flying off a ledge with a single well-timed nudge.</p>

<p>Since recording that video, Orchard looks to have worked out how to ensure cutscenes trigger independently for each player's instance of the game, as well as ensuring hats and held items don't only show up for the host.The current version, <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client/releases/tag/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>, has also been through a couple of rounds of bugfixing since its initial 1.0 release last month, meaning it should hopefully be stable and relatively free from the sort of frustrating jank which could impede the intended fun jank.</p><p>As of writing, the modder is working on adding the likes of "dynamic suit muddying and wetness", water/dust particles, and "player sound effects" - which I assume'll be suitably goofy - to an equation which already seems a brilliant recipe for mischief and the occasional ruined friendship.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving that kind of action a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">MelonLoader</a> framework and follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQRWCoEZUk">handy installation tutorial</a> Orchard's put together. For more thoughts on Baby Steps, I direct you to Nic, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-twitch-slop-you-have-simply-let-your-sense-of-wonder-atrophy">reckons Irish comic Dara Ó Briain would dig it</a>.</p>

              <p>External storage needs have exploded as file sizes balloon with 4K video and high-resolution photos that exceed what internal drives can handle. Samsung recently launched their T9 portable SSDs with improved durability features but the performance gap compared to the T7 is minimal for most users while the price difference is substantial.</p>
<p>That makes the T7 SSD the smarter choice for anyone prioritizing value without sacrificing speed or capacity. Prime Big Deal Day<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/"> has pushed the 2TB Samsung T7 down to $129 from its usual $187 price, which marks an all-time low</a> that makes premium portable storage genuinely affordable. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight, giving members just hours to grab what remains the most popular external SSD on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True Speed and Capacity that Matter</h2>
<p>The Samsung T7 PCIe NVMe technology<strong> can read at up to 1,050 MB/s, and write at up to 1,000 MB/s</strong>, translating to transferring a 50GB video project in just under a minute. Compare that with slower external hard drives plodding along at 120 MB/s and you know why creatives have left spinning platters behind. It makes <strong>the T7 roughly twice as fast as Samsung’s own previous T5</strong>, which is a significant leap that affects your workflow every time you transfer large files.</p>



<p>The 2TB size is just the sweet spot for the average user and offers enough storage room for full-scale libraries of videos, massive collections of photographs or complete sets of computer games without requiring frequent housekeeping. With 2TB, you never have the hassle of rotating files around or determining which ones need deleting as new material arrives. Samsung sells the T7 in capacities as high as 4TB, but the 2TB is the best-value-per-gigabyte at current price points.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in direct video recording abilities</strong> turn the T7 from just storage into a production device: Plug it into compatible cameras or smartphones and capture Ultra High Definition 4K video at 60 frames per second directly to the drive. You can use the iPhone 17 Pro’s ProRes video mode to shoot directly onto the T7 and <strong>skip the phone’s small internal storage</strong> and allowing you to capture multiple hours of professional quality video without clogging up your phone.</p>



<p>The T7’s solid aluminum unibody construction provides <strong>shock resistance with drop protection tested up to 6 feet</strong>. This metal chassis serves double duty by acting as a heatsink that dissipates the heat generated during sustained high-speed transfers, preventing thermal throttling that could slow performance. The compact design measures roughly the size of a credit card and weighs just 0,13lbs/58 grams.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility eliminates the typical hassles of formatting drives for other systems: The <strong>T7 is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Android smartphones, and gaming consoles</strong> via the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface without a hitch. Samsung ships the drive with both the USB-C to C and the USB-C to A cable, providing the capability of plugging into both new and old devices without scrambling for adapters. The drive comes<strong> shipped in the exFAT format</strong>, which is read-compatible on virtually all contemporary operating systems without reformating.</p>
<p>At a price of $129 in the 2TB version, you pay approximately 6 cents per gigbyte on storage that reads the data at almost ten times the speed that the mechanical drives read the data. Keep in mind, this Prime Big Deal Day price ends tonight.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is getting a free trial for an entire week, starting 9th October. This free trial for last year's Call of Duty will provide access to the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies game modes - so interested players can play everything Blops currently has to offer.</p>
<p>This on its own would be some nice news for those looking for something to do during this month but with little money in their pocket right now, but an extra interesting layer to this free trial is that it's taking place during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> release.</p>
<p>If this timing is intentional, it would mark the first case of marketing retaliation from Activision in the ongoing public scuffle between the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and Battlefield 6. This scuffle started during the Battlefield 6 Multiplayer reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">where the developers at Battlefield Studios weren't shy about their intentions to stick to sensible military cosmetics, rather than the gaudy out-of-universe skins available in CoD</a>.</p>

<p>Following this discussion about wacky cosmetics' prevalence in Call of Duty entering the zeitgeist, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">Activision soon announced its intention to pull back a bit from its cosmetic approach in Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, EA continued to push this messaging in advertisements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">bringing in celebrities to star in a recent Battlefield 6 live-action trailer in reference to Call of Duty's history of selling real-world figures as in-game skins</a>. The trailer soon blows these celebrities up, with a squad of typical looking soldiers taking their place.</p><p>So the clash over public opinion has been rather one-sided so far, but dropping Black Ops 6 for free during the Battlefield 6 release date is a pretty solid way to strike back, especially given the fact that Black Ops 6 is at the tail end of its lifespan with Black Ops 7 set to launch next month.</p>
<p>For those who do decide to hop into Black Ops 6 during this free week, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-06#Events">they'll be met with a collection of Halloween-themed events and cosmetics</a> to get them into the festive mood. These will transfer over to Warzone but not to Black Ops 7 as part of that aforementioned decision to keep things visually coherent in the new game, so keep that in mind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-in-80-minutes.1319371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Indie Barcelona-based developer Epictellers Entertainment announced that its turn-based cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight met and exceeded the minimum funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Kickstarter</a> just eighty minutes after the campaign opened.</p>



<p>For the record, the minimum goal was €75K, but supporters have already pushed the campaign to around €280K as we speak. With 29 days left on the campaign, it's fair to imagine the developers will be able to get a far greater amount of funding when all is said and done.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is based on Paizo's eponymous science fantasy setting originally introduced in 2017. Players can look forward to a party-based RPG where they will lead a legendary crew, shape their destiny with choices and, most importantly, save the galaxy. It has been described as Divinity: Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>



<p>The premise is that the ship's captain has vanished just as the galaxy is facing annihilation. Players must then assemble a crew of misfits from across the stars. There are six unique companions, from android assassins to mystic prophets, each with personal stories and moral dilemmas. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight adapts the tabletop RPG's second edition and includes the following classes: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. Being a roleplaying game, leveling up and collecting alien gear to become more powerful will be the key.</p>



<p>Epictellers stressed that no choice is forbidden, yet everything has consequences. Factions will remember the crew's deeds, and the companions will judge the player's heart. Branching storylines ensure that no two adventures are alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the 40-60 hours of adventure, players will get to explore neon stations, undead worlds, digital gods, and cosmic dragons. The game features multiple difficulty settings (from a story mode to Nightmare), mod support, and community tools on PC, and a voice cast directed by Neil Newbon (who won multiple awards for his performance as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3).</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is currently targeting a Q2 2026 launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. At that point, the game will feature Act 1 with around 10-15 hours of gameplay. The full release is loosely estimated to happen in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-hits-amd-hard-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-is-now-going-for-50-less-than-the-previous-model-2000633107</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-hits-amd-hard-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-is-now-going-for-50-less-than-the-previous-model.1319368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building (or upgrading) a gaming PC means making smart choices about where to invest your budget and the processor sits at the heart of everything. AMD’s Ryzen 7 9700X occupies that sweet spot in their lineup where you get serious performance without crossing into extreme enthusiast territory. This 8-core chip from the latest Zen 5 architecture delivers the processing muscle needed for modern gaming and content creation while staying within reach for most builders. Right now, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/">can grab this processor for just $250 instead of its usual $359 price</a>, but there’s a catch: <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day offer expires tonight</strong>, which makes this your last chance to secure an all-time low on <strong>one of AMD’s newest desktop chips</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Gaming</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 7 9700X packs 8 cores and 16 threads into your system</strong>, a setup that is no stranger to multitasking and still capable of providing the single-threaded performance that games require. That <strong>5.5 GHz maximum boost frequency means the CPU can increase speed when needed,</strong> accelerating frames in fast-paced games where milliseconds matter. AMD says this part can produce <strong>over 100 FPS in mainstream games</strong> which is supported by the Zen 5 design’s gains in instructions per clock cycle over the previous gen.</p>



<p>The unlockable multiplier gives enthusiasts freedom to <strong>further tune performance through overclocking</strong>. In this manner, you can increase the clock speed beyond the factory level if you have enough cooling, wringing out additional performance from the chip for work that benefits from sheer frequency. The <strong>combined 40 MB cache appears as ultra-fast memory on the very processor die</strong>, and reduces the time that the CPU is sitting idle waiting on data from the system RAM. This amount of cache is key to gaming, as the CPU is always reaching into the texture data, the logic of the game, and the asset files.</p>
<p>DDR5-5600 future-proofs your build by providing support for the newest memory standard. DDR5 has a greater bandwidth compared to DDR4 which translates into more data being transferred between your RAM and CPU per second. It pays dividends on everything from loading times in games through to video rendering, where large data sets require endless shuffling.</p>



<p>Socket AM5 compatibility matters because AMD has committed to supporting this platform through future processor generations. This means you can upgrade to <strong>newer Ryzen chips down the road without replacing your motherboard</strong>, and protect your investment in the platform. The processor <strong>supports PCIe 5.0 on compatible motherboards</strong>, doubling the bandwidth available for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs compared to PCIe 4.0.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 7 9700X is AMD’s mainstream performance option among the Ryzen 7 offerings: It is under the high-core-count offerings like the 9900X and 9950X that target content creators and professionals but over the budget-friendly Ryzen 5 chips that have 6 cores. Where that places the 9700X is in the sweet spot between gamers who want excellent frame rates and have enough oomph left over for streaming or side work like editing video.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 units have been sold in the past thirty days, and <strong>a score of 4.8 stars through virtually 1,500 reviews</strong>, buyers absolutely love what their new CPU is bringing home. You’re saving $109 off the regular price when you pay just $250, but remember that t<strong>his deal ends when the special Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-990-evo-plus-ssd-is-going-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-its-excess-stock-at-a-record-low-price-2000633103</link>

              <p>Storage limitations can kill productivity faster than almost anything else in the digital age. Running out of space means constant file juggling, deleted projects you might need later and that dreaded warning message interrupting your workflow at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>This is where a high-capacity internal SSD becomes essential and today is your final chance to grab an exceptional deal: <strong>Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>, and Prime members can <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/">get the Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD with a massive 4TB capacity for just $199, down from its regular $327 price</a>. This all-time low represents a serious opportunity to supercharge your PC or laptop with professional-grade storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Transforms Your PC Experience</h2>
<p>The Samsung 990 Evo Plus brings performance that really changes the way you work with massive files and intensive apps. It <strong>reads sequentially at up to 7,250 MB/s and writes at up to 6,300 MB/s</strong>, figures that equate to real-world performance gains you can appreciate today. <strong>Moving a 50GB video project that can take a few minutes on a hard drive takes just seconds here</strong>.</p>
<p>Those data-transfer rates derive from Samsung’s latest-generation NAND memory technology which is the pinnacle of storage chip engineering. On the interface side, the drive is compatible with <strong>both the PCIe 4.0 x4 and the PCIe 5.0 x2 interface</strong> which translates into the drive auto-adapting to the capability of the motherboard and always providing optimum bandwidth no matter what gen the system is compatible with.</p>



<p>The 4TB capacity resolves the storage bottleneck that creative professionals and power users experience on a regular basis. Today’s game installs easily surpass 100GB, and the 4K video files and high-def photo libraries devour terabytes before you know it. This much storage on one drive obviates the need for external storage wrangling or the maintenance of multiple small drives. Samsung’s Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 technology streamlines the way the drive approaches large file operations by providing a high-performance buffer that boosts write speed under high-workload conditions.</p>



<p>Thermal management is what distinguishes quality SSDs from the ones that throttle performance when they get hot: The 990 Evo Plus employs a nickel-coated efficiency-specific controller that enables <strong>the drive to reach optimal speed without consuming more power than the earlier generations</strong>. This is crucially important to laptop users whose battery life is critical, as well as desktop builders whoseheat build-up can cause system instability.</p>
<p>Samsung includes with every shipment their <em>Magician Software</em> suite which contains utilities that keep your SSD in top form long after installation. Drive health is monitored through tracking lifetime left and durability-based performance metrics, giving warnings before data loss is possible. Firmware updates also arrive automatically through Magician, ensuring that your drive benefits from Samsung’s newest developments and security patches. More still, the software contains further encryption utilities for safeguarding vital data as well as performance optimization tools that tailor the interaction between the drive and the OS.</p>
<p>More than 9,000 units have been sold in the last month alone and, <strong>following a 4.8-star rating through more than 7,000 reviews</strong>, the 990 Evo Plus has firmly secured itself among intensive users. At $199 per 4TB, you’re <strong>getting approximately 5 cents per gig</strong>, which is brilliant value for such performance. Note that this Prime-member deal is gone after tonight when the Prime Big Deal Day ends, so the price window is very small.</p>

<p>Excitement levels for the Fortnitemares event in Fortnite continue to rise, and further teasers have been shared by Epic Games showing the big collabs fans can expect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Halloween event has become a fan-favorite, with previous years including collabs with Saw, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others, and Epic Games is going big again.</p>



<p>The event, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-fortnitemares-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to kick off this week</a>, is yet to have full official details shared, but we know have confirmation of three major collabs.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-collabs-2025">Fortnitemares Collabs 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Peely-good collabs. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Official teasers were <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1975685374996312433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Reddit</a> by the Fortnite team, showcasing promo art featuring Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O alongside recognisable Fortnite characters and items.</p>



<p>The Scooby-Doo Mystery Crew are depicted surrounded by thorns, likely a nod towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat’s Mother of Thorns skin</a>, alongside a terrified Loot Llama, while Ghostface was shown with the reflection of a terrified Peely on his knife.</p>



<p>Finally, characters from R.E.P.O were shown with long arms and legs in order to fit the Fortnite style, a terrifying look in itself, running away from a zombie.</p>



<p>The build-up to Fortnitemares has already seen the return of several horror-themed outfits to the Item Shop, including Ash Williams, Leatherface, and there’s still more expected to be revealed in the coming days, including a Terrifier collab.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether any skins will be available for free through the event or if they are merely appearing in the Item Shop for purchase.</p>



<p>Usually, Fortnite makes some cosmetic items available to earn for free during Fortnitemares, although last year’s content did not include any free outfits.</p>



<p>What collabs do you want to see in Fortnitemares? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>The recent price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate won't affect existing subscribers in some countries, Microsoft has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last week, the price of the top tier subscription went up by 50 percent, and has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-is-it-time-to-cancel-and-start-buying-games-again">met by criticism</a>. But in some countries, this will only impact new subscribers - at least "for now".</p>
<p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," reads an email from Microsoft sent to subscribers in some regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p>

<figcaption>Is Xbox Game Pass still worth it?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJgWIx5dfT4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Microsoft has further confirmed this in a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>"Our recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We'll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries," says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications</p>
<p>The countries unaffected by the price increase include Germany, Ireland, Italy, South Korea, Poland, and India. The US and UK are not included.</p>
<p>It's been speculated this change is due to local regulation on subscription price changes. The email from Microsoft notes subscribers will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of any price changes - so at the least, this latest increase won't take effect for another two months.</p>
<p>Last week,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year"> Microsoft announced the price increase of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> amid a shake up of its subscription tiers. This comes despite the company making record revenue from subscriptions last year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-a-result-of-microsoft-becoming-too-big-to-care-says-former-ftc-chair">former chair of the FTC</a>, who opposed Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, claimed the Game Pass price increase is due to Microsoft becoming "too-big-to-care".</p>

			<p>With only two days left before Battlefield 6's official launch, the developers <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1975637378636144955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have shared</a> the full, detailed PC system requirements, ranging from Minimum to Ultra++.</p>



<p>As with all Battlefield games since 2008's Bad Company, Battlefield 6 is powered by DICE's own Frostbite engine. However, this time around, the development teams collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have explicitly focused on maximizing performance rather than, for instance, adding fancy visual features like ray tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Indeed, according to the developers, Battlefield 6 won't even need any upscalers before the Ultra++ preset, where they recommended using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to get 4K@144 frames per second at High Settings, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation is needed</a> to achieve 4K@240 frames per second at Ultra Settings. That's on a GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card; notably, no AMD equivalent is listed for the Ultra++ preset.</p>

            <p>As someone from the north east of England, there's a good chance my genetic makeup's some mix of old school celt and one of the many Scandinavian invaders who sailed across looking to conquer back in a time when blokes called Cnut roamed northern Europe. I offer that background in case it helps you understand why, even though I'm not part t-rex as far as I know, the premise of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dinolords">Dinolords</a> very much gets my blood pumping.</p>
<p>It's a hybrid of medieval strategy and action RPG which injects rideable t-rexes into a war between the Danes and the English, and a closed alpha test of it starts on October 31st, ahead of an early access release next year.</p>

<p>For those who gain entry, this alpha'll start with a three-part tutorial to get you up to speed with the game's funky mix of medival siege tactics and dino action. Then, four maps and two game modes will open up to offer a proper taste and test what developers Northplay call your "hack’n’strat skills". There's also the chance to have a crack at setting up a stronghold to try out the likes of base building, combat strategy, and unit control before you get the siege engines rolling.</p><p>"Dinolords is our chance to bring a unique blend of genres to players, and with the Closed Alpha Test, give them a taste of what to expect when the Early Access release launches next year," said Northplay boss Michael Flarup. "We are excited to hear what our player base thinks of the game and look forward to the feedback received to help shape Dinolords into the best possible title it can be." As such, there'll be a questionnaire to fill out in the name of feedback.</p>
<p>If you want an idea of what Dinolords is like to play beyond the quirky premise, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/t-rexes-arent-the-only-twist-that-dinolords-puts-on-medieval-strategy">James was intrigued by what he saw of it at Gamescom last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Enemy raptors can also scale the walls of your town, munching on archers as they go, while Danish T-rexes are apparently bred to specialise in destroying static defences. They’re not just here for laughs, in other words: each dino breed presents a distinct tactical challenge that you’ll need to plan for and counter in different ways, and while your lord is strong, he’s also not quite enough of a Diablo-tier godkiller that you can ignore your more traditionally RTS-y units.</blockquote>
<p>Sign-ups for Dinolords' closed alpha kick off today, October 8th, via the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2587620/Dinolords/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10.1319344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection doesn’t have to drain your wallet and right now might be the perfect time to jump in: The trading card craze has sparked fresh enthusiasm across all generations, from kids discovering these iconic creatures for the first time to adults rekindling their childhood passion. <strong>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day</strong> is wrapping up today, and there’s a standout offer that everyone can grab, Prime member or not: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">this assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards has dropped to just $5, down from its usual $10 price tag</a>. It’s an all-time low that makes expanding your collection incredibly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This collection ships exactly as collectors require without the hassle of searching outlets individually at high-end premium prices. You <strong>receive 50 randomly selected cards taken from the entirety of the Pokemon universe</strong>, <strong>covering every series issued</strong>. You get regular character cards as well as energy cards, which provides usable items suitable for actual play as well as collectibles that fans love.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates will be found in the randomized sets</strong>, but that is part of the trade that collectors appreciate as they trade the excess with buddies or utilize them towards completing certain deck layouts.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Collection Pack Worth Getting</h2>
<p>The true value here is beyond the rock-bottom price: Each lot is like a surprise package as the cards include random series which can have <strong>anything ranging from vintage Base Set designs to recent releases</strong>. Randomization is something that works favorably in the case of <strong>new collectors</strong> establishing a good base without the need to have encyclopedic information on sets that need to be targeted. For parents introducing children to the concept, it is an affordable method of giving enough cards towards building multiple decks and testing out varied strategies.</p>



<p>The 50-card quantity is just the right size for collection expansion: It’s high enough that it is something significant that you can feel like you’ve accomplished something without being too overwhelming that new collectors don’t know quite what to do with them. Advanced collectors will pick these lots up just as a way to fill missing cards they have from past-generation sets or fill out common cards, which are often needed as part of building out a tournament-legal deck. Because the sets span all generations, you’re handling the initial 151 creatures through the latest expansion sets that include recent release games.</p>
<p>At $5 for Prime Day, <strong>you’re getting roughly 10 cents per card</strong>, which seriously undercuts what you would pay buying single cards or even regular booster packs at retail stores. Because today is the final day that the Prime Big Deal Day concludes, these prices will not last.</p>

<p>It took quite a bit of waiting, but we finally know when PowerWash Simulator 2 is set to release. Luckily, you do not have to wait much longer!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new game</a> allows you to spend hours spraying away at all kinds of grime and dirt with friends, with some nice new features on the way.</p>



<p>Here is the PowerWash Simulator 2 release date, along with the exact time you can expect to be able to start playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not too much longer before you can come here. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The PowerWash Simulator 2 release date is set for October 23, just two weeks following the announcement of the release date. It is releasing on all current-generation consoles and PC and will be included in </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-confirmed-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions</strong></a><strong> on day one.</strong></p>



<p>As a continuation of the first game, you will be cleaning all kinds of different buildings and all kinds of various objects covered in some nasty gunk across a total of 38 levels at launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are some new tools</a> you can use for the job, as well as the ability to take stuff to your shop, clean it, and decorate the headquarters with the newly cleaned items.</p>



<p>Friends will be able to join you in the fun as well. While online co-op was available in the original game, there is an added bonus of splitscreen local multiplayer this time. Additionally, people who join you in an online lobby will share the progress made alongside the host as levels are completed and various rewards are earned.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-time-powerwash-simulator-2-releases">Do We Know the Time PowerWash Simulator 2 Releases?</h2>



<p><strong>If we can believe the </strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PlayStation Store</strong></a><strong>, then PowerWash Simulator 2 is set to release in the morning in the United States on October 23. The store page currently says that the game will release at 9 AM CT.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>With the PlayStation Store page being updated shortly after the announcement of the release date, this may not be the perfect evidence that this is the official release time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-vr-no-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, but it’s our best look at the timing as of this moment. If this is the planned timing, you can expect the game to become available at the following times in some major time zones.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Oct 23</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Oct 23</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Oct 23</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Oct 23</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – Oct 24</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The Minecraft crew join the Season Pass</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was released for the Switch at the end of last month, and now in an update, Sega has locked in the first Season Pass DLC release date.</p>
<p>This included a teaser trailer and the confirmation that the paid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Pack is out this week on 8th October 2025. It contains Steve, Alex and Creeper, along with a new track. This is available in the Season Pass and Digital Deluxe Edition, or you can purchase the standalone pack.</p>

<p>This will also be joined by the in-game Minecraft Festival, which will run from 9th October 2025 until 12th October 2025 and is free to join, even if you don't have access to the pack.</p>
<p>This pack will be followed by SpongeBob, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Avatar: Legends.

<p>Legends: Z-A will also be available on the Switch</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>As we've already mentioned, October is a huge month for the Switch 2 (and Switch) with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>So far, there's been some Mega reveals and distribution events announced, and now Nintendo has sunk some of its marketing budget for the game into a commercial featuring the 'Stranger Things' star, Gaten Matarazzo.</p>
<p>The Netflix series is currently in its fifth season, and although there are no links here, Matarazzo is known to be a big fan of Nintendo and has previously teamed up with the company to promote titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this new commercial we get to see the star harness the power of Mega Evolutions, while also highlighting how the Switch 2 is just as playable, when you're out and about, as Nintendo's original hybrid system.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A launches for the Switch 2 and original Switch on 16th October 2025. It's arriving in between an already action-packed month of game releases. The new Pokémon game will also be joined by a new Switch 2 bundle on the same date, which includes a copy of the latest entry.</p>

                <p>Earlier today, developer Teenage Astronauts and publisher No More Robots were preparing to launch their new role-playing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-rocket-lab/" data-ref-id="5000-654308">Little Rocket Lab</a>. Unfortunately for the team, Steam went down just as the game was about to launch.</p><p>Mike Rose--the founder of No More Robots--shared his reaction to this turn of events on social media.</p><p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m2mlu7vudc2h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a follow-up message</a> an hour later, Rose said he was "livid," before <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m2mnh3nqtc2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expressing his relief</a> when Steam went back online. Players can now grab Little Rocket Lab on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Xbox. No More Robots released a trailer for the game as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgWY496AV5U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgWY496AV5U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as a young engineer named Morgan, and her ultimate goal is to fulfill her family's dream of building a rocket ship. Before she can get to that point, Morgan has to rebuild her family home and put her skills to use in her hometown, St. Ambroise, and make life easier on the people who live there.</p><p>Last month, indie developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel shared a letter from Steam acknowledging that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-bug-botched-this-indie-games-launch-now-its-getting-a-second-chance/1100-6534899/" data-ref-id="1100-6534899">had botched the launch</a> of their game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri</a>. Steam offered the developers the visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Steam recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-game-update-reportedly-distributed-malware-and-stole-money-from-cancer-victim/1100-6534915/" data-ref-id="1100-6534915">removed a game</a> called BlockBlasters for distributing malware.

Despite Steam's dominance in the PC realm, a new study suggests that Xbox users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-users-reportedly-play-more-games-than-ps5-or-steam-players-and-theres-one-big-reason-why/1100-6534950/" data-ref-id="1100-6534950">play more games than they do on PS5 or Steam</a> thanks to Game Pass.</p>

<p>We're taking baby steps with this one</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="bc74c5000bab3"><a title="Nintendo Life Image" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc74c5000bab3/nintendo-life-image.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo yesterday surprised <em>everyone</em> with a new animated short called '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-goes-full-pixar-in-strange-new-animated-short-film-close-to-you">Close To You</a></strong>', and it's already led to all sorts of theories online.</p>
<p>We know Nintendo is currently in the process of expanding beyond video games with theme parks and movies (<em>we're looking at you,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>). It's also got its video production company '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/nintendo-launches-official-website-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">Nintendo Pictures</a>' and recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">Mario product line in Japan</a> for younger audiences, made up of rattles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">building blocks with amiibo functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Then there's perhaps the most common claim that this new video is tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>. If you watch the short, it appears there's <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1975553503524458919"><em>something</em> invisible</a> moving all the objects in the scene, and Nintendo enthusiasts online have <a href="https://x.com/RogersBase/status/1975703210863304718">seemingly matched up the music</a> in this trailer with the game series.</p>
<p>We've even got <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/53641-nintendo-drops-close-to-you-animated-short-update">past quotes from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto</a> telling us how Pikmin are "all over our world" and "invisible to the naked eye". So, what do you think? Is this something to do with Pikmin, or do you think it's something completely different? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

But in advance of that debut performance later tonight, the band has released a new song with no fanfare, one that wasn’t featured in the Netflix musical. Or at least that’s what Spotify is currently indicating. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yNNYQBChuox9A5Ka93BIn?si=bD2voW0ITLeASfThiMvk-g">Huntr/x Spotify account</a> posted a song called “Mazatlan By Night” on Sunday, and it’s only accumulated about 6,000 listens so far. Considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">how big <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>has become</a> in the past few months, you’d think a new song from the titular girl group would have exploded in even just a few days. So what’s up with this song? Well, for one thing, it doesn’t seem to actually be a Huntr/x song.</p> <p>Sometimes other artists’ work will appear on a group’s Spotify page if they’re featured or if one of their songs is sampled, but I’ve listened to the <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>soundtrack hundreds of times and couldn’t pick out anything from this piece that would put Huntr/x anywhere near the credits. I tried using the Shazam app, which listens to music and gives you the title, and it couldn’t identify the song as anything, much less a new song by Rumi, Zoey, and Mira. This could have been uploaded to the Huntr/x account in error, or there might be something more nefarious going on. The song’s copyright is for “Diskerux Diamond,” which doesn’t bring up any search results on Google. Well, it might bring up this article now. We’ve reached out to Universal Music Group for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p>  <p>It’s entirely possible the account was hacked and someone uploaded this song to the Huntr/x account without authorization. Or it could have been a technical error that…somehow ended up on the Spotify page of one of the biggest groups in music right now. Sorry to the 6,000 of you that listened to it expecting something new from the girls. But hey, at least we’ll get to hear them performing “Golden” live on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in a little bit.</p>
