Destiny: Rising, the free-to-play mobile version of Bungie's long-running sci-fi shooter series, has been given a release date. It'll officially be whisking players away for some alternate-timeline shenanigans when it comes to Android and iOS on 28th August.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">last October</a>, Destiny: Rising is a collaboration between Bungie and Chinese publisher NetEase, and is officially described as a "shared world" adventure set in an "alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era". It's a result of a partnership the two companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">initially announced</a> - albeit in vague terms - back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
After a period of closed alpha testing that began last November, Destiny: Rising is almost ready for its full launch, which'll see players - in the role of a "fully customisable" Lightbearer named Wolf - embarking on a sci-fi adventure stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift."

<p>
Destiny's familiar looter-shooter action is said to remain at the heart of the experience, and there's talk of "dynamic and challenging" single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, plus various open-world objectives, missions, strikes, PvP battles, and six-player PvE activities. That's alongside customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability for characters to share compatible weapons across their arsenal, a new Mythic rarity gear tier, and more.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to encourage pre-registrations ahead of Destiny: Rising's 28th August release, NetEase is holding a pre-launch event that'll provide special in-game bonuses to anyone that registers their interest ahead of time. More rewards unlock as new registration milestones are crossed, and if that sounds like the sort of thing you want to support, you should direct your attention to <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/c6f53fla">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/kxdnllj3">App Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Daddy Destiny (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, if you must), Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">recently announced its next major multi-year story arc</a>, the Fate Saga. It begins with a new paid expansion, titled The Edge of Fate, that arrives on 15th July alongside a free "core game update" for all players. Weirder is this year's second paid expansion, Renegades, which launches on 2nd December and promises to be "integral" to Destiny 2's new Fate Saga, despite its Star Wars theme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While the Switch 2 is dominating headlines around the world, it’s easy to forget the little guys. There’s plenty handhelds that are out there making people’s lives better without all the pomp and grandeur. Enter the Miyoo Flip, a retro handheld designed for emulation that takes some clear inspiration from one of Nintendo’s most iconic handhelds, the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>This clamshell device brings all the nostalgia to the yard. Picking it up had me reminiscing for days about my red Game Boy Advance SP with Groudon carefully embossed on the cover, and the days I spent playing Pokemon Ruby, Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. The Miyoo Flip feels like the original device, and given that the SP is arguably still one of the best handheld designs we’ve ever had, that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Measuring just over 8cm in either direction and 2.5cm thick when folded shut, it’s genuinely pocketable, though there’s also a very lovely hardshell case in the box that makes it a bit too chunky for your pocket. It easily fits in your bag though, and you don’t have to worry about it getting damaged at all. It’s so small compared to modern handheld PCs and consoles that you don’t need to think too hard about taking it everywhere with you, and our review unit has already been around the world a bunch of times with me without any hassle.</p>
<p>There’s a variety of different colours available, with our review unit arriving in a truly retro black and red livery. It looks like the contents of every kids’ bedroom in the 80s and early 90s, and the lighter plastics used make it feel pretty authentic to the period as well. It doesn’t feel premium, but when it’s priced around £70 you’re probably not expecting it too. What it does feel like is an authentic reimagining of a classic form factor.</p>

<p>It is equipped for more than just Game Boy games though, and the Rockchip RK3566 chipset and the central controls of a D-pad, four face buttons, four shoulder buttons and two inset analogue sticks at the bottom, make it ideal for emulation up to, and including, N64, Dreamcast, PSP and PlayStation.</p>

<p>They’re not the best analogue sticks in the world; not in terms of their actual functionality, but because they’re pretty deeply inset to allow the clamshell to close. They also sit at the foot of the device, which can become pretty tiring for your hands, depending on how you’re holding the Flip. It’s nice to have them though, and they do work well, but I’ve found myself mostly gravitating to the excellent-feeling D-pad, and the console generations that still focused their efforts on them.</p>
<p>Overall comfort is, however, very good. The light plastics make this an easy device to hold for long periods of time, and I do find that I prefer the narrow profile of systems like the Miyoo Flip, Trimui Brick or the classic Game Boy systems, when it’s a smaller device. If you liked the form factor of the Game Boy Advance SP, then.. this is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>The screen is a 3.5mm IPS LCD display with a 640×480 resolution, and it’s bright and colourful with plenty of clarity and decent viewing angles. It’s not ultra-high resolution, but the 4:3 scale means that this is a great device for playing classic titles, whether revisiting favourites like Super Mario World or Guardian Heroes, or checking out titles you haven’t found time to pull out of the cupboard in years. It does mean that PSP games suffer though, with large black bars above and below the wider aspect output. That’s a shame with a system that can readily play the games, but an easy concession given the form factor.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this is the perfect device for revisiting your Game Boy Advance library. Given that it has to be one of my all-time favourite handhelds, that’s a huge benefit, and with the cannily crafted form factor, the Miyoo Flip is a pure shot of nostalgia. No, it’s not a perfect integer scaled resolution for the GBA, but it’s more than good enough to enjoy these games.</p>
<p>Miyoo included both the original and the revised operating software during our review period, and the updated OS made interacting with the Flip just that much easier. It’s simple, clear and straightforward, and while it is more stripped back than some offerings, it runs flawlessly, though I’m pretty certain I’ve heard that background music before. You do also have the option of running EmulationStation if that’s your preferred launcher, and you can opt for a range of its glitzier frontends if you prefer, though it may take a bit more tinkering to get everything working.</p>
<p>There’s a few handy quality of life inclusions here, not least the appearance of a Mini-HDMI out, a second USB-C socket for attaching a wired controller and two Micro SD card slots for adding even more storage. Thanks to that, this is a tiny device that’s capable of holding pretty much every game made up until 2000 and playing them, and that’s pretty special.</p>

<p>Some early builds of the Miyoo Flip were criticised for the build quality of the hinge, but in this V2 iteration it feels rock solid, unleashing a satisfying and solid click every time you open it, and moving through the three different viewing angles. Beyond that, the 3,000 mAh battery is suitable, if not stellar, and you’re going to get a good five to seven hours out of it depending on the games you’re emulating.</p>
<p>You are paying a slight premium for this form factor, with some serious competition from the standard Game Boy-evoking Trimui Brick that certainly feels more solid in your hand, but doesn’t have any analogue sticks, despite having similar processing power to the Miyoo Flip. The overall experience is much slicker with the Flip than budget retro handhelds like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/">Boyhom R36H</a>, but it should be when the Flip costs twice as much.</p>

Now, in 2025, we’ve had two new MCU films — <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts*</em> — that were either critically panned and commercially disappointing, or critically loved yet struggling to make MCU-sized returns. Marvel is in a bit of crisis mode.</p><p>Its movies are no longer the safest bet in Hollywood. The Disney+ shows have started to feel more like homework than appointment television, even for the biggest MCU fans. From where I’m sitting, after being a critic for over fourteen years and a lifelong comic book reader, the issues Marvel Studios is going through are mistakes that Marvel Comics has also made over the last few decades. There’s much .Marvel has done over the decades that are genius and have helped the comic book industry. But the company has also put its comic book arm in peril just as many times.</p><p>The MCU completely redefined not only superhero movies but the idea of movie franchises. All that success made Marvel Studios too comfortable with the audience, even after other studios had failed in their attempts to copy them. Why is it, then, that audiences have been disappointed? Why have the movies this year not been hitting the highs they used to? Why does each show seem like a shooting star that disappears from the cultural conversation almost the instant it airs?</p><p>Here, I’m going to diagnose some of the symptoms that have led the MCU to its current struggle era — and ways it can return to its glory days.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is one you’ll hear the most. Many people felt <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> was a perfect conclusion to the saga that had been told, yet they remained interested in the MCU. Marvel Comics has a history of this pattern. When they hit big with the audience and have a strong group of creators producing stories that resonate, Marvel tended to try squeezing more out of the moment than they should. They flood the shelves with more titles and miniseries, and suddenly every character has their own comic.</p><p> When I bought the <em>Civil War</em> event, I decided to purchase every single tie-in title. By the end, it added up to 100 issues—and realistically, only the <em>Captain America</em> issues mattered to the main story. Even recently, with the <em>Blood Hunt</em> event, there were a ton of extra miniseries that felt completely unnecessary once you read the main comic. These moments made me want to read Marvel less because it felt like the company didn’t care as much and was just exploiting my love for the Marvel Universe.</p><p> After <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> briefly became the highest-grossing film of all time, not even a global pandemic could stop Marvel Studios from flooring the gas pedal. In 2021, they significantly ramped up output: four Disney+ shows and four theatrical films in a single year. Every quarter, there were two concurrent Marvel projects demanding attention. Villains and lesser-known Avengers got shows and films, while brand-new characters were introduced to replicate the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> surprise. But aside from Spider-Man—who’s a cheat code, honestly—and Doctor Strange, most of those new additions didn’t stick. They ended up confusing and exhausting audiences. Feige and his Parliament seemed to ignore Marvel’s publishing history in their “research.” They repeated a mistake the company knows all too well: burnout. </p><p> Their slowdown in 2024, with fewer projects, feels like a step in the right direction. Still, they could’ve done a better job connecting more grounded films like <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts</em> to shows like <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> and <em>Ironheart</em>. Only time will tell if a leaner Marvel output leads to the higher-quality releases fans deserve. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why did it take so long for Black Widow to get her movie? With a star like Scarlett Johansson, who’s been with the MCU since Iron Man 2, you’d think she’d earn her movie before the big Thanos throwdown. For some reason, it came out after the character was dead. Then they didn’t even put it in theaters. I know Hawkeye might not be a marquee name, but he was an Avenger, and his story got demoted to just a TV show. For some reason, Sam Wilson becoming Captain America—with the Winter Soldier as his partner—was also a show. <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> should have definitely been a movie instead of a television series. Fans know these characters just as well as they did Black Widow and could’ve brought in an audience at an important time for starting a new story.</p><p>Now, here’s the thing: I like Shang-Chi—he’s the master of Kung Fu. The Eternals are deep-cut characters and would’ve been a good counter to that planned DC <em>New Gods</em> film, battling big Jack Kirby ideas against each other. Why couldn’t they crack an <em>Armor Wars</em> movie with Don Cheadle’s James Rhodes, especially with an Academy Award and Emmy nominations on his résumé? What’s the deal with Hulk, and how come he’s yet to have another movie—instead of Anthony Mackie’s Cap getting shoehorned into a Hulk story?</p><p>Marvel should use the names people know to draw them to theaters.  Charlie Cox’s Daredevil showing up in <em>No Way Home</em> and <em>She-Hulk: Attorney At Law</em> made the interconnected universe feel fun. <em>Ghost Rider</em> needs to get a second chance, perhaps with the Robbie Reyes version from the comics to attract some of <em>Fast and Furious</em> fans A muscle car with wheels on fire is an attractive visual. While they’ve also let that <em>Nova Corps</em> setup from a decade ago atrophy, they should still build new heroes while also building upon what the larger fanbase already knows. That can help generate excitement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The multiverse angle hasn’t worked as well as Marvel had hoped. While it was an interesting setup for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, building the entire second MCU saga around alternate versions of familiar characters—or ones from previous adaptations—hasn’t connected with audiences as expected. Seeing Tom Holland’s Spidey meet past Spider-Men and fight their villains, almost forming an MCU version of the Sinister Six, was thrilling. Doctor Strange traveling through realities worked, too. But Marvel’s push toward the 2015 <em>Secret Wars </em>comics<em>&nbsp;</em>concept, with multiple versions of the same characters clashing, feels clunky. A better move would’ve been adapting the original ’80s <em>Secret Wars</em>, with a godlike being like Doom forcing heroes and villains to fight on Battleworld—a much simpler, more engaging concept. WWE has done this every year with Survivor Series. It’s not hard to grasp.</p><p>When they announced a <em>Secret Invasion</em> show, I thought that story would’ve made a stronger backbone for a new three-phase saga right after <em>Endgame</em>. In the comics, massive universe-changing events are often followed by more grounded, Earth-based threats—or cosmic stories that only affect a few heroes. After <em>Civil War</em>, we got <em>World War Hulk</em>, which pitted Hulk against the Illuminati during a fractured time for superheroes. Then came <em>Original Sin</em>, a murder mystery that helped bridge to <em>Infinity</em>, <em>AXIS</em>, and finally <em>Secret Wars</em> 2015. Even if those stories weren’t all perfect, they gave readers breathing room and kept the stakes personal and digestible.</p><p>Marvel could have taken a similar approach with the Skrulls—seeding them in shows and movies for years before building to a full-scale takeover. That would’ve been <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> on a superhero scale—not the misfire of a show we got.</p><p>Other events like <em>Acts of Vengeance</em>, <em>The Kree/Skrull War</em>, <em>Shadowland</em>, or even newer stories like <em>Blood Hunt</em> could’ve worked like the original Avengers films did. Each phase would carry a thematic thread across films and series, with big Avengers team-ups as satisfying payoffs. It’s baffling that Marvel drifted from the very formula that made it so successful.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why was Red Skull only used in one movie? He’s a Nazi—basically a bad guy cheat code perfect for recurring use. No Masters of Evil. No Fin Fang Foom, despite the popularity of Godzilla-style movies. They turned MODOK into a badly rendered joke in <em>Quantumania</em>. Where was Thor’s classic villainess, The Enchantress? She could’ve spanned movies and shows and made a better long-term threat than Valentina Allegra de Fontaine trying to be a darker, quippier Nick Fury.</p><p>Why not adapt <em>The Korvac Saga</em>? It could’ve followed a fractured Avengers team dealing with the fallout of the Blip and the loss of Tony, Cap, and Natasha. Watching the team disassemble after failing against Korvac would’ve explained their six-year absence better than just ignoring them.</p><p>One of the MCU’s biggest issues is how it softens or discards its villains. Zemo, for example, was right about super soldiers and the Avengers’ collateral damage. He’s not a villain anymore, just an anti-hero. Gone are the villains who want to rule the world or rob a bank. Instead, they make these characters so sympathetic that audiences often side with them more than the heroes. Marvel seems more invested in their villains than their leads.</p><p>I get making villains complex, but Marvel often goes too far, or just turns its heroes into the villains. Wanda’s destruction in <em>Multiverse of Madness</em> doesn’t feel earned if we’re still meant to root for her. Gorr in <em>Love and Thunder</em> was a terrible adaptation; it’s hard to argue with him given how useless the MCU’s gods are. Dar-Benn in <em>The Marvels</em> responds to Captain Marvel bombing her home world. The Leader in <em>Brave New World</em> is portrayed more like a suppressed genius than a threat. And <em>Thunderbolts*</em> is about helping a hero through depression.</p><p>When Marvel does give us a true villain, like The High Evolutionary in <em>Guardians Vol. 3, </em>it works. He’s evil, cruel, and compelling. That’s the direction they need. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>’s Kingpin brings that old menace back. Same with Loki at his best. Let’s see more villains like that—the kind that made Marvel worth watching in the first place.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Kang is a classic Marvel supervillain, but Kang is confusing. Even diehard Marvel Comics fans struggle to explain him. Beyond everything with Jonathan Majors and Marvel’s decision not to recast, it says a lot that the character didn’t resonate. Who or what is Kang? How do you explain Nathaniel Richards and his ties to Reed Richards and Doctor Doom without using either character—or even acknowledging they exist? And then you have him lose to Ant-Man. ANT-MAN!</p><p>Compare that to how Thanos was built up: introduced as Loki’s superior, intimidating enough to boss around Ronan the Accuser, and then finally unleashed in <em>Infinity War</em>. It worked.</p><p>I’ve read tons of comics but never ran into Kang until <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, where Avengers from different eras united to stop him and other Kangs. It was good, but I had to research just to fully understand it. The more you deal with Kang, the more research you need. Time travel villains don’t have to be confusing, but Kang often is. He’s mostly an Avengers foe, and not a Marvel-wide threat like Thanos. There were other cosmic-level villains to choose from, yet Marvel picked one of the hardest to adapt.</p><p>Maybe they planned to hint at his connections—like being Rama-Tut in ancient Egypt or using Doom’s time platform to link him to <em>Fantastic Four</em>. But instead, we got a post-credit scene of the Council of Kangs—just multiple Jonathan Majors in bad makeup. His MCU debut was shaky too: <em>He Who Remains</em> beating other Kangs to control the timeline isn’t a strong hook. Try explaining <em>Loki</em> season one and how it ties into <em>Quantumania</em> without sounding unhinged. Thanos just needed magic rocks. Simple.</p><p>Maybe Kang should’ve been a one-off like Red Skull. Instead, they introduced him in two quirky projects and had him fight Scott Lang and his ants. Then he loses, shows up in <em>Loki</em> with a goofy haircut, and gets evaporated. He had a strong first appearance, but Marvel didn’t know what to do with him. Turning him into the core of the Multiverse Saga was likely the big mistake.</p><p>Secret Wars has always been about Doom—not Kang.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What I don’t care for is how the MCU has turned The Avengers into a brand instead of a consistent presence. Because of the films’ box office success, Marvel now treats the team like a summer comic book event—something you “build up to.” In comics, both Marvel and DC have always had tentpole summer crossovers—<em>House of M</em>, <em>Civil War</em>, and <em>Secret Invasion</em> from Marvel; <em>Identity Crisis</em>, <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, and <em>52</em> from DC. These events bring together a wide cast of heroes, spark tie-in stories, and launch new characters. But between those events, The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four<em>&nbsp;</em>are always around.</p><p>In the MCU, though, there’s been no proper team in action until <em>Thunderbolts*</em> and the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. And that long wait just feels unnecessary.</p><p>One of the charming things about The Avengers in the comics is that the roster was often oddball: a couple of scrubs and one star. Within six issues, you had “Cap’s Kooky Quartet”—Captain America, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch. No Hulk, Thor, or Iron Man. That model worked, and it still would today. Wouldn’t it be interesting to see a team of Shang-Chi, Wong, Sam Wilson and the new Falcon, and She-Hulk trying to help people? And maybe they’re not doing great at it.</p><p>Now that the Netflix characters are canon, was <em>The Defenders</em> ever referenced again? Did they team back up? Was it on the news? The MCU also keeps teasing Young Avengers or Champions, but won’t commit. These characters show up in cameos or secret side roles, but never truly form a team. Why not just pull the trigger and let them grow across projects?</p><p>This approach makes fans feel strung along. Instead of building real momentum or emotional investment, Marvel just keeps hinting at what’s next—without giving us the actual teams that made the comics worth coming back to every month.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Go all the way back to Phase One, and you see how each post-credit scene pushed the larger narrative leading to The Avengers. The end of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> is directly followed by a post-credits scene, which is actually a scene from the film. This continued into Phase Two, and it felt like even if the movie you saw wasn’t the best, that last scene could give you the hype you needed to make sure you were in theaters for the next film. It perfectly captured the early days of Marvel Comics, where you’d see little cameos of characters from other comics in panels, and then, as you read, you’d see a little editor’s note directing you to check out another title.</p><p>Yet now, most of the post-credit scenes feel like dangling cliffhangers that will never be realized in a new movie or show. We were teased Blade in The Eternals years ago. What happened to Dane Whitman, the Black Knight? That was Kit Harington — Jon freaking Snow — and he can’t be brought back after all these years? Many Phase Four and Phase Five scenes felt, at times, like they were trolling the audience and going against what we expected.</p><p>While it seems like they’re getting back on track with the post-credit scene in <em>Thunderbolts</em>, it just feels a bit too late, as we’ve been burned too often. Building on what I stated earlier, with the phases functioning as story arcs on their own while still advancing the saga, they need to return to making each post-credit scene feel like it’s pushing the larger story forward. Even if they want it to be funny or a bit of a troll, there still has to be some meat there for our appetites to hook onto—so we don’t walk away feeling like our time was wasted.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This might just be a personal thing, but why does every Marvel movie need so much humor? It’s gotten to the point where the tension is constantly undercut by jokes, making it feel like the characters aren’t taking anything seriously. They make it seem like they know everything will work out. This also weakens the antagonists, reducing them to mere obstacles in the protagonist’s personal drama.</p><p>One of the biggest victims of this is <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>. It’s so silly that when Thor and his crew are on screen, it feels like Christian Bale is acting in a completely different film. Nothing ever feels dangerous; at best, it plays like a <em>Scooby-Doo</em> episode with superpowers. Even <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, a movie I enjoyed, leaned too heavily into jokes. Compared to the first two <em>Deadpool</em> films, the humor here often overtakes the heart and personal stakes Wade once carried.</p><p>This overreliance on humor and the tendency to make every Marvel movie an action-comedy flattens the superhero genre. Not only has it become formulaic—it’s become a punchline. In the recent film <em>Friendship</em>, a character mentions going to see “the new Marvel” and everyone immediately gets the joke. That’s a bad sign. Marvel’s slump isn’t just about box office—it’s about perception. People are tuning out.</p><p>Marvel keeps promoting new movies or shows by claiming they’re tapping into other genres, but most of the time, they’re just more MCU fare with jokes at timed intervals. It feels like they’ve abandoned genre experimentation. Phase Two gave us real variety: <em>The Winter Soldier</em> worked as a political thriller, <em>Ant-Man</em> was a heist comedy, and <em>Iron Man 3</em>—a movie I don’t even like—at least felt like a Shane Black buddy action flick.</p><p>Marvel used to be the “cool” alternative to DC. Now it’s the “quirky” one. It’s time to dial back the humor—not to go dark, but to be sharp, confident, and cool again.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Early on, the MCU felt very focused on adapting the tone and vibe of Marvel comics. While not one-to-one adaptations, they blended the spirit of classic Marvel, Modern Marvel, and the Ultimate line. Iron Man’s origin, for example, was captured perfectly, appealing to general audiences while wowing diehard fans by bringing beloved characters to life. Involving comic creators in the production helped strike the right balance to make it enjoyable for everyone.</p><p>But once the MCU hit massive success, it started treating the comics more as a hindrance than a guide. For me, that shift began with <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. The setup and themes were changed completely. While the film technically split the heroes, most audiences were just excited to see Black Panther and Spider-Man debut. I’m not even a big fan of Mark Millar’s comic or his post-9/11 worldview, but the premise—young heroes botching a mission, sparking a national debate on superhero accountability—was compelling. In the movie, it boiled down to Tony being mad that Cap chose Bucky over him, and Zemo manipulating everyone. It stripped away the political nuance in favor of hero-on-hero spectacle.</p><p>Fans would ask what to read before watching <em>Shang-Chi</em> or <em>The Marvels</em>, and I had nothing to recommend. Even explainer accounts are often just guessing based on Wikipedia and trailers. Straying too far from the comics could repeat the mistake <em>Game of Thrones</em> made: abandoning the source led to a disappointing ending. Unlike that series, Marvel doesn’t have to guess—the stories are already there. Bringing more creators back into the fold would help course-correct.</p><p>The MCU should lean more on its strongest stories to win fans back. Let the comics lead, rather than just using characters as loose inspiration. I’d love to see them attempt stories like <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, <em>Inferno</em>, or <em>Wolverine: Enemy of the State</em>. They could spark wildly different films and shows, while recapturing the shared tone that once connected the comics and MCU so well.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c31be0e4dd2d4/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 brought with it something we'd dreamt about on the original Switch: GameCube games on NSO.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">the new GC controller</a> giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> that authentic feeling (while also adding wireless without a WaveBird and sneaking in some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-gyro-and-a-better-d-pad">gyro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-using-a-gamecube-controller-with-the-nso-app-yields-fun-surprises">other neat features</a>, too), we've been having a great time with the four available games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation-apparently-has-underlying-issues-nintendo-desperately-needs-to-fix">Some emulation teething issues</a> aside, we haven't run into anything like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/10/nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-games-need-some-work">the problems of the N64 app at launch</a>, and we're dead excited for the upcoming lineup. Have you seen the secondhand price of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> these days!?</p>
<p>However, with the Switch 1 libraries we've accumulated over eight years, plus the larger sizes of Switch 2 games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is 59.4GB, for instance) and a paucity of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">'proper' physical game card releases</a>, storage space is at a premium - even if you've added more to the internal 256GB with a micro SD Express card.</p>
<p>Even with a pricey 1TB card, though, I couldn't get all my games on the system. Having to pick and choose what I take with me is a necessity now. Now, compared to a monster like Cyberpunk (or the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>, which will apparently weigh in at 73.2GB), the 6GB that the GameCube app currently asks for is small potatoes. The addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> this week bumped the overall download up from 5.1GB, so the situation isn't dire just yet.</p>
<p>The GameCube's cute little discs could hold nearly 1.5GB of data, so even accounting for any jiggery-pokery from Nintendo or repackaging of the ROMs, individual games aren't likely to be larger than that (most, like Strikers, will be much smaller).</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd8c962d75bb5/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some games came on two discs, of course, though I'd say the chances of seeing this one on NSO are slim — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But on a handheld console where every gigabyte counts, the option to pick and choose the ISOs we want to take with us would be appreciated. As the library grows (it's currently at four, with six further games announced), so too will that app. And while the quality of the games so far is impressive, as with the other NSO retro apps, there are some games that you're just not going to play, for whatever reason. When the entire Game Boy offering takes up just 134MB, that's fine, but we could be saving valuable gigabytes with these GameCube games.</p>
<p>There's something to be said for having the entire library with you. There's always a chance you might discover a game you wouldn't have given the time of day otherwise, and having instant access to the lot <em>is</em> fantastic. But when my menu screen is filled with download bars flashing a little 'X' in the middle, something's got to give. It ain't gonna be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but the memory cost of having that with me at all times is going to increase every month.</p>
<p>And if we dare to dream that Wii games might one day get their own Nintendo Classics app, the sizes are only going to get bigger. Whether there's a genuine chance of Wii games ever coming to Switch 2 is a topic for another day, but the fact is that some of us would love to have a little more control over exactly what's on our systems.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you like to be able to leave Wind Waker on the virtual shelf to make space for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wave_race_blue_storm">Wave Race</a> (which surely must be coming, right?!)? Download an <em>extra</em> copy of F-Zero, perhaps - just in case? Let's get a handle on it in the poll below.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will likely remain the most expensive entry in the series even after its sequel is released, as a former Rockstar Games employee expects the development of the seventh entry to be cheaper.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KIWITALKZ">KIWI TALKS</a> show, former Rockstar Games Technical Lead Obbe Vermeij, who worked on many iconic entries in the series like Vice City and San Andreas, discussed the future of the franchise past the sixth entry in the series launching next year, saying that there's likely not going to be a more expensive entry in the series than Grand Theft Auto VI because a lot of the development work is going to be taken over by AI, such as the work for maps and cutscenes. As such, no longer needing manual labor for these tasks, it is expected that Grand Theft Auto 7 will be cheaper to make than its predecessor, painting once again a grim picture for anyone working in the gaming industry. It will take a while, however, to see if Vermeij's prediction will be true, as we are unlikely to see Grand Theft Auto 7 for a very long time.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#191 - Obbe Vermeij Interview On The GTA Trilogy, GTA VI, Rockstar And His Indie Game Plentiful....." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYcdZTGvIBs?start=1323&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Talking about Grand Theft Auto 7 definitely seems a bit premature, considering Grand Theft Auto VI still has to come out. The highly anticipated new entry in the series was supposed to launch before the end of the year, but back in May, Rockstar Games confirmed the game would need more time and will launch in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 2026</a>. Despite the delay, the excitement surrounding the game continues to be high, and some of its features promise to change not only open-world games but also entertainment as a whole, such as the rumored option for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/">artists to upload their music directly into the game.</a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Forza Motorsport series developer Turn 10 has become a Forza Horizon support studio, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-turn-10-studios-employee-claims-that-forza-motorsport-has-been-shuttered-and-the-studio-will-be-supporting-horizon.1235709/">ResetERA forums</a>, former Turn 10 employee Fred Russel revealed on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfaMale164S">Facebook</a> that the studio has shuttered the Forza Motorsport space and is now <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/0883ecbe1a63f7f109aa85ebde368458.png">a support studio for the Forza Horizon series</a> developed by Playground Games. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">over 70 employees were laid off this week</a>, this was somewhat expected.</p>



<p>Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 is only one of the studios that has been impacted by the recent wave of layoffs. The Initiative, the studio put together to work on a new entry in the Perfect Dark series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">shut down</a>, and the project was cancelled. Rare's<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/"> Everwild</a> was similarly cancelled, as was a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">reportedly loved by Phil Spencer back in March</a>, but apparently being widely appreciated by the head of Xbox is not enough to avoid cancellation. Other projects developed by other partners were also cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">an unannounced FPS</a> that was in the works by Romero Games, the studio founded by the co-creator of the DOOM series, John Romero.</p>



<p>It's a massive shame that the Forza Motorsport series seems to be done for the time being, as the latest entry in the franchise was a return to form, according to Chris. You can learn more about it in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/">review.</a></p>

            <p>If the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem is not enough newness for all you zombie-loving fans, then I have some good news. Today, a new strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series has been announced.</p>
<p>It's known as Resident Evil Survival Unit, and is set for release across mobile devices. While Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, Capcom is working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality".</p>

<p>Details on what the game will look like and involve for now remain somewhat mysterious, though we can look forward to finding out more later this month, with a showcase planned for 10th July. It will take place at 11pm UK time.</p>
<p>The studios have said Resident Evil Survival Unit will "appeal to both longtime fans and new players". While we don't yet have a release date, it will be available globally across Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia whenever it does arrive.</p>
<p>Along with this info, some artwork for Resident Evil Survival Unit was shared, showing a car driving down a road as a lightning storm rages. To one side, a sign for Umbrella - yes, that rather questionable corporation - declares that "our business is life itself…". The two people on the sign smile away. Oh, what poor sweet fools.</p>
<p>In terms of the Resi timeline, Umbrella itself went defunct in 2003, following the Raccoon Trials. Given this, we can perhaps surmise from the artwork that Resident Evil Survival Unit at least takes place before that time.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the series,  we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dying Light developer Techland has confirmed there have been no staff reductions following the reported cancellation of two in-development games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Pulz Biznesu</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-cancels-two-upcoming-games-including-its-new-fantasy-rpg-ip">GameWatcher</a>), the developer published record losses of 135m zl (£27.4m) for 2024, as per the <a href="https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/rdf/pd/search_df">Polish National Court Register</a>. While the two projects have not been named, it's presumed one is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-working-on-open-world-fantasy-action-rpg">fantasy RPG revealed in May 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a spokesperson for Techland said: "Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline.</p>

<p>"Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time."</p>
<p>Little is known about the fantasy RPG, though the company recruited top talent from the likes of CD Projekt Red, Arkane, and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with what we have accomplished with the Dying Light franchise so far," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland CEO, at the time of the game's announcement.</p>
<p>"At the same time, our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity."</p>
<p>Although the record losses are significant, Techland's most recently released game was Dying Light 2 back in 2022. The first Dying Light, released in 2015, was a massive hit for the company, selling 20m copies as of 2022. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">sequel sold 5m in around two months</a>.</p>
<p>The company's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, coming 22nd August.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">Techland announced it would be releasing multiple projects in the Dying Light series</a>, including board games and a webcomic. Following these new cancellations, it seems the company is focusing on its most successful franchise.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's petition to the European Commission has hit a major milestone, surpassing a million signatures. However, the YouTuber behind this effort to stop companies from rendering games unplayable by shutting down their servers is still asking for more folks to get their pens out and sign, due to concerns about fakery.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ross Scott originally launched <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">back in 2024</a>, after Ubisoft pulled racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline. Cue a lot of debates about terms of service which tell folks that when you buy a game, you're not buying permanent access to it, but rather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">a license to play it</a> for as long as it exists.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">European Citizens' Initiative</a> has crossed 1 million signatures. Except it hasn't," Scott announced in a video update uploaded to his channel Accursed Farms yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody's mistakes."</p>
<p>"That could be a lot," he continued, "I've heard 10% minimum, 20% is better, 40% should be really safe." The second issue is that Scott says he's "received several reports of people claiming to [have spoofed] signatures on the initiative site."</p>

<p>"First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition. This is a government process," Scott continues. "Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this."</p>
<p>It's unclear at this point whether any folks spoofing signatures on the EU petition might end up being prosecuted for doing so, but it won't invalidate the campaign as a whole. However, the fact Scott's even heard talk of such a thing has left him unsure of exactly how many real signatures he's got. He reckons there are "at least 600–700k" at current.</p>
<p>Hence him <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">asking for EU citizens</a> to keep on signing legitimately. As of writing, the EU petition is at 1,091,165 signatures, with a million having been the goal that would lead the European Commission to at least look into the issue.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games also has a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/">UK petition</a>, which currently has just over 150k signatures, and looks set to receive a date when it'll be debated in parliament soon. That said, the UK Government have already issued a response to that petition back in February, which reads: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games. Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue."</p>
<p>"I would bet money on the EU initiative delivering something good if it passes, but the UK has been more about exhausting all options," Scott says in the video. He adds regarding that previous response from UK politicians: "A member of Parliament could sneeze on the petition, and that would not be a worse answer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake]]></content:encoded>

It’s all in the name of protecting the video games players love – and even the ones they don’t – as the industry steadily marches toward a digital future.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of games we buy today are built to just stop working when the publisher pulls the plug on em. It needs to stop.

While gamers take to the internet to celebrate, spokesperson and organizer Ross Scott says reaching 1 million signatures is good news but far from a victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, the breaking news: The European Citizens’ Initiative has crossed 1 million signatures – except it hasn’t,” Scott said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video update</u></a> uploaded yesterday. “This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody’s mistakes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an important variable in the equation on the road to 1 million legitimate Stop Killing Games endorsements, and it’s just one flaw to consider. The other involves reports Scott has received regarding fabricated signatures that could be artificially inflating the initiative’s progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition,” Scott adds. “This is a government process. Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this. They’ll be checked later by the EU commission, and my guess is the fake ones will get turned over to the Europol or Interpol, and they’ll follow up on this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">To anyone who made a mistake or isn't sure if they signed the EU initiative already, you can contact the official spokesperson (Daniel Ondruska) and he can direct you on how to reach the EU to sort it out. His contact is on the page under "more info"<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1941018169977852169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">To account for what could be a significant number of invalid Stop Killing Games signatures, the initiative has altered its ideal goal to be 1.4 million signatures. At the time of this story’s publication, Stop Killing Games has reached 1.07 million endorsements ahead of its July 31 end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, yeah, that sucks,” Scott continued. “We’ll just keep plodding away unless we can figure out what the safe numbers are. Sorry this isn’t a big victory celebration. This is just kind of suspenseful and tense instead, and will probably hurt the morale of people signing.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save States</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott, who has created gaming content via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Accursed Farms</u></a> YouTube channel for more than a decade, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>launched</u></a> Stop Killing Games in April 2024 as a direct response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-delisted-from-all-digital-storefronts-servers-shut-down-early-2024"><u>Ubisoft’s decision to shut down its popular open-world racing game, The Crew</u></a>. The movement aims to create a ripple effect that could shake the industry into keeping games online long after players lose interest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It means everything from The Crew to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-concords-servers-now-closed-fans-wonder-if-itll-return-as-free-to-play-at-least-one-expert-has-doubts"><u>Concord</u></a> could theoretically remain online to enjoy should the initiative amass enough public complaints to see the European Commission pass a law protecting consumer rights. Ideally, players could see live-service and multiplayer titles like BioWare’s Anthem, which was given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january"><u>a shutdown schedule</u></a> just yesterday, could continue on in some form should a publisher decide to sunset support. Success could also mean single-player games that rely on online components, such as Death Stranding or Dark Souls, could remain intact, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WEAK</p><p>I know Anthem got panned, but it's another example of one that seems like it had a cool looking world to run around in.

Following its promising launch last year, however, the initiative struggled to maintain the support it needed to push its way through to the eyes that needed to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games’ chances at a successful campaign became so dire that Scott went as far as to publish a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The end of Stop Killing Games</u></a>” just last week. In the hour-long explainer piece, Scott listed a lack of exposure as one primary cause behind the lack of support. It was the Hail Mary the initiative needed, though, as prominent YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_5WIzkM0r8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jacksepticeye</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penquinz0/Cr1TiKaL</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmulltSgWg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ludwig</u></a>, and more were quick to voice their support with their own videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All within the weeks since Scott shared his concerns, Stop Killing Games has gained hundreds of thousands of signatures, resulting in a solid chunk of the more than 1 million names attached to the movement today. Success remains uncertain even if Scott is able to reach that magic 1.4 million number, with even more uncertainty lying on the other side of that goal post. Still, as outlined by Scott on the Stop Killing Games website, he feels optimistic about the future of game preservation if the signature goal is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we can pass the signature threshold," Scott says, "there is a very strong chance that the European Commission will pass new law that will both protect consumer rights to retain video games that customers have purchased and advance preservation efforts massively."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should the word get out to enough interested individuals, players could see somewhat of a return to the days when buying a game came with the assurance that it would remain playable regardless of post-launch interference.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the video game cancelations and studio closures that have come as a result of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">Microsoft’s devastating round of layoffs this week</a> is concern about the fate of pretty much every Xbox game without a firm release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft games canceled as part of the cuts include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild</a>, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark Reboot</a>. The latter's developer, The Initiative, was shut down. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-rumble-wont-get-any-new-content-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-development-team">The team working on Blizzard’s mobile game Warcraft Rumble was laid off as new content ceased</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, external developers who were funded by Microsoft were also hit. Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">has suffered significant layoffs and the future of its new shooter is in doubt</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to take in, but it begs the question: which Xbox Game Studios games remain? And which, if any, were quietly canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN this week, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, said Microsoft still has "more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> is continuing on. So, what were those games, which we now assume are safe — at least for the time being?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at the show, and is certain to come out later this year (despite the layoffs hitting its various developers). inXile game Clockwork Revolution starred at the show, so that’s safe. Obsidian’s Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2 were at the show and we should assume are both safe. It's a similar deal for Double Fine’s Keeper, The Coalition’s Gears of War: Reloaded, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s Order of the Giants DLC. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the ROG Xbox Ally, both at the show, will continue too. Despite the cancelation of Everwild, Rare’s Sea of Thieves continues with new updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the showcase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer teased Forza, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and a Halo: Combat Evolved remake for 2026</a>. We assume since those games were mentioned, they’re safe,  although it’s worth noting that the Forza mentioned by Spencer no doubt relates to the next Forza Horizon game from Playground, which is also making Fable. Turn 10, which makes the more sim-focused Forza games, was hit hard by the layoffs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we know which games Microsoft still intends to release. But, given the events of this week, it’s now impossible to think about other Xbox games in the works without a degree of concern. Everwild and Perfect Dark were conspicuous by their absence at last month's show and both were canceled. What else failed to turn up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft — remember Microsoft owns Minecraft! — remains huge and safe as houses, you feel. But what about Contraband from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios? Where’s Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3? Ninja Theory’s Project Mara? Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima game, OD, on its books. Is that still happening? Toys for Bob, the Crash Bandicoot 4 developer and Call of Duty support studio that left the Xbox-owned Activision in February 2024, signed an agreement with Xbox directly to publish its next game. Is that still alive?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Bethesda? ZOS’s MMO has fallen by the wayside, but surely Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls VI and the next Fallout are fine. Starfield’s promised next expansion feels precarious, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">given Bethesda's radio silence on the game</a>. And what about Blizzard? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">As of last year it was reportedly hard at work on a StarCraft shooter</a>. Is that still the case?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when you run through what <em>wasn’t</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase last month that you realize what’s at stake here: Microsoft owns a huge number of development studios across the globe, from Bethesda to Blizzard and Activision to Halo. When Xbox suffers significant problems, a huge swathe of the video game industry and its developers do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on August's gamescom, where Microsoft is expected to show more of what is has coming down the line. Perhaps Phil Spencer will give fans a clear idea of what’s in the works from Xbox and what isn't as Microsoft's multiplatform push soldiers on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library">It is still planning to release a next-gen Xbox console</a>, although we don't know when. Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">the first-party Xbox handheld Spencer teased</a> last year also still alive? Does Microsoft still plan to release its own gaming app store, despite the failure of <a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/231166/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-activision-shuts-down-its-battle-royale-mobile-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, Warcraft Rumble, and this week's significant cuts to Candy Crush maker King? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the short term, at least, the games we saw in June are still on the way. But the long term future of Xbox remains vague indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>AMD FSR 4 running on PlayStation 5 Pro promises to be more interesting than anticipated, judging from what a well-known insider revealed recently.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD insider KeplerL2 commented on the recent announcement that the next version of the AMD upscaler is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, saying that the system cannot run the model that is being used by the upscaler to run on RDNA4 GPUs. Sony and AMD started working on the mid-generation refresh before AMD decided to move FSR to an ML model, and when the company made the switch, the PlayStation 5 Pro design was done with no FP8 support. As such, it will be very interesting to see how running the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">full-fat version of the upscale</a>r on the system will be achieved.</p>



<p>Those expecting to see games that support the AI-powered PSSR on PlayStation 5 Pro to automatically support AMD FSR 4 without developer intervention, however, may be disappointed. As far as KeplerL2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/ps5-pro-is-getting-a-big-upgrade-in-2026-%E2%80%94-i-asked-mark-cerny-what%E2%80%99s-coming-and-why-amd%E2%80%99s-future-pc-gpus-feel-more-playstation-than-ever.1685909/post-270585067">knows</a>, the current version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps, so there's a very likely chance that developers will have to update already released games if they want to take advantage of AMD FSR 4 once it becomes available for the system in 2026.</p>



<p>Besides offering the aforementioned AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose implementation has been hit and miss, depending on the game, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers other improvements that make it the system of choice to enjoy PS5 games at their very best. You can learn more about the system by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The studio making underwater survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have promised fans that "nothing has changed" despite a recent drastic change in leadership at the company. The game is still planned to be a single player survival adventure with optional co-op.</p>
<p>"Nothing has changed with how the game is structured," said a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement posted to Unknown World's website</a> yesterday. "It will remain a single-player first experience, with optional co-operative multiplayer. No subscriptions. No loot boxes. No battle pass. No microtransactions." Okay nameless statement, this still dosn't clear anything up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We know that you have a lot of questions and concerns about the news from our publisher regarding the leadership changes at Unknown Worlds," it begins, and then spends eight paragraphs not answering those questions. "We’re also supporting Steve Papoutsis as he transitions into his role as CEO at Unknown Worlds. He’s already expressed his excitement to check out everything we’ve been working on."

</p><p>Earlier this week Krafton, the publishers who own Unknown Worlds, announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">three senior staff members were being replaced by an executive</a> from one of their other studios. Steve Papoutsis, who worked on sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>, is now the CEO of the studio. Those leaving include studio co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire. </p>
<p>In the press release which made that announcement, there were some lines about a renewed commitment to "achieving regular milestones". The subtext is that Krafton believed Unknown Worlds were not working fast enough. Their new guy, they suggest, will commit to regular checks from on-high.</p>

<p>"These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations."</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> (hi) are squinting heavily at the megapublisher with untrusting eyes. Hence yesterday's damage control in the form of a "letter to our community", which is mostly a defence of incoming CEO Papoutsis and his benefactors at Krafton.</p>
<p>"We want to reassure you that KRAFTON feels strongly about supporting that vision at the studio, as we continue to navigate the game toward Early Access," the letter continues. "While we work closely with Steve and get him up to speed with all the amazing work the team has already done on Subnautica 2, we also understand that it means we’ll need to ask you to remain a little patient and support us as he comes on board."</p>
<p>They go on to promise that a new schedule and early access timeline will be coming soon, but still don't answer any obvious questions about this whole drama. Ousting the long-serving leaders of a studio and installing a former EA producer who presided over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-hardline">Battlefield Hardline</a> is a drastic assertion of control. So what happened? Why kick out those three specific people? Should more people expect to be laid off? Will the team face the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-callisto-protocol-proves-that-crunch-is-dumb">reportedly disastrous crunch conditions that affected The Callisto Protocol</a>? No answers are forthcoming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Unknown Worlds saying "no loot boxes" is like a cereal company saying "we don't plan to add any mice to this batch of corn flakes". I, uh, never thought you were going to? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The studio promises not to fill the game with lootboxes, and okay, thanks? Lootboxes are not the real worry, and the game is reportedly so far along in development it would likely be technically unfeasible to introduce such features anyway. The real worry is that the culture, morale, and day-to-day working experience at Unknown Worlds may alter for the worse. </p>
<p>A final wrinkle in the story: former studio head Charlie Cleveland says he is "Now making some films!" on LinkedIn. This comes after he recently moved to LA and set up a movie company, the website for which is awash with <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">generative AI movie posters</a> and <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/zeroes">wonky-faced placeholder images</a>. Which I imagine might distract someone from actual game development. But unless anyone involved speaks plainly about this messy situation, all we will have is speculation.</p>

		<p>As we get to another Friday and the weekend beckons once more, I get to annoy the whole team by asking them over the same question I ask every week: what have you played? I’ve played a few different things this week, though Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma keeps taking my time while I build up all my villages and try to make all the characters my friends. Other than that, I was able to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/formula-legends-preview-an-arcade-racing-love-letter-to-f1/">Formula Legends</a>, which looks like it’ll be a great arcade racer.</p>

<p>Firstly, a little note to say congratulations to Ade and Jim, whose <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History Kickstarter project</a> achieved its funding this week! We can’t wait to read it!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played a little Destiny 2, lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">Death Stranding 2</a>, and started Atomfall. Speaking of the latter, he says, “It’s not as shooty as I would like there’s a lot of wandering around and sneaking. Also I have a big problem with the way it gives you quests. It puts markers on the map where to go but you have to manually add a marker to track it when running about. Stupid game, either give quest locations or don’t!”</p>


<p>TC’s adventures in games continued, but he didn’t get on with Starship Troopers, telling us, “I just fired up Starship Troopers. And then turned it off again. Looking down your sights on a gun means the gun – and I’m not exaggerating here – takes up almost a quarter of the screen. Blocks out a huge area so you can’t see what your shooting at. Who on earth designed that game???” Here’s hoping he finds something he likes to play this week.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a very nostalgic week, continuing his Metroid series run through taking in the “excellent” fan-made AMR2, saying, “It’s a worthy alternative to Nintendo’s own Samus Returns (although the latter is probably more akin to where they went with Dread) and the seminal Super Metroid.” He continues, “The SNES game is rightfully lauded, but there are a few too many crucial paths hidden in places that seem wilfully obtuse. I also finished a run of Lost in Random: The Eternal Die and may well carry on to try and unlock all the relics etc. Finally I finished the neat Crypt Custodian, started Recore as my daily Xbox Rewards game and got deep into the world of Gex for an upcoming review.”</p>
<p><strong>Reuben</strong> has been playing pretty much only JRPGs, telling us, “They give me the happy brain chemicals that I’m not getting anywhere else! I’ve been jumping back and forth between the incredible Metaphor ReFantazio and the recent HD Remaster release of Bravely Default (one of my all-time favourite games).”</p>
<p>I think <strong>Nic</strong> is probably planning an intervention for Reu after hearing that, but maybe he’s been distracted by playing Final Fantasy MTG. He told us, “This set is sweet as hell. I’m going to be so sad when it’s not the current set in a few weeks time”.</p>

<p>Giving in and buying a Switch 2, <strong>Jason&nbsp;</strong>started off by working through the 50CC category of Mario Kart World to test out some of the new stuff and get a vibe for it all. He also showed off the free roam to his kids so they could see the dinosaurs. Besides that, he’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, and a bit of Atlas Fallen too.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Chaos The Game, aka Strangers of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins. He says, “The combat has been fun but this game just throws loot at you and that can be overwhelming. The story is a bit mad too but I do like how Jack has no time for long speeches and spiels. Particularly liked when a villain was introducing themselves and he just said I don’t give a fuck who you are and punched him.” Top-tier Final Fantasy dialogue right there.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> finished Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 this week, and said, “Whilst the combat never quite clicked for me, the storyline was majestic, with some stellar plot twists that compelled me to see it through to its satisfying conclusion’. That’s not all because he also indulged in som sci-fi co-op action,&nbsp; “I also completed Revenge of the Savage Planet with Laura, and we enjoyed it! The balmy plot left us totally baffled but all the co-op metroidvaniaing was top-notch entertainment.”</p>

<p>Speaking of <strong>Laura</strong>, welcome to our newest writer, who only vaguely admitted to knowing Ade. She told us, “I started playing Atomfall this week, after watching Ade play it and getting itchy fingers when he didn’t play it the way I wanted it to be played! He told me I should get a baseball bat. So in true “independent woman” style, I levelled up and got myself a spiked baseball bat instead! I also completed my first TSA review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/rooftops-alleys-review/">Rooftops &amp; Alleys</a>, in which I spent most my time doing flips and landing on my noggin. Good times!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been chipping away at Split/Second, saying, “It’s still proving equal parts fun and challenging. Before moving onto the next big game from my backlog I decided to finally play through Limbo – I’m super curious what the team at Playdead having been making after all these years.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round things out with&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> as usual, who’s been able to dip back into FBC: Firebreak and continues to find it a rather unusual riff on the co-op shooter, shared some thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and has had a sudden urge to rewatch the Stargate movie…</p>
<p><em>And finally, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

            <p>January 12th, 2026. It's my next birthday, and also now the date that BioWare exosuit shooter Anthem will finally be taken offline. I very much assume the two things are unrelated.</p>
<p>The live-service thing that EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-canceling-their-anthem-overhaul-to-focus-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age">abandoned doing live-service stuff for</a> not that long after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">well-documentedly difficult development</a> was followed by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-review">lukewarm release</a> is finally going the way of the dodo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," EA wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">a post</a> on their website, "This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline."</p>
<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we’d like to thank you for that," the publisher added, also letting us know that this shutdown isn't resulting in any layoffs. It might seem a strange clarification to make - Anthem hasn't been a going concern for years and EA have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">sliced BioWare's staff</a> post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Veilguard</a>, but I guess the company have just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">read the room</a> for once and want to make clear any potential consequences for the developers, rather than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">sliding around the subject</a> as they have in other announcements.</p>
<p>Once that plug's pulled, Anthem will cease to be playable since it's an online-only affair. That means you've got roughly 192 days to do as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-huh-biowares-exosuit-shooter-anthem-is-still-online">our Alice O did back in 2023</a> - suddenly remember that Anthem exists and hop in to give it a go like you're taking one last joyride in an old car that'll never get the work done to stop it imminently being resigned to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>She wrote the following of that sojourn to the abandoned kingdom of Anthem:</p>
<blockquote>Is Anthem good? No. It's a looter-shooter with boring loot and perfunctory shoot. But I like parts," "Flying my cool-looking exosuit around is pleasant, lazily swooping around the skies of an alien world. It's an involved movement too, because the suit slowly heats up and you need to regularly cool it by diving downwards or flying through waterfalls and such. I'm always happy when simply getting about involves playful little motions. And I'm kind of interested in some of the traditionally BioWare-y NPC chatter and storybits going on back at the hub base? But the rest of the game's not good enough for me to persist.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I've just checked and assuming you don't already own it, you'll need to pay for an EA Play subscription to try <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/buy/pc">Anthem on PC</a> before its song is sung. The game's also set to be removed from that service in 43 days' time, as of writing, so your window's suddenly gotten a lot smaller.</p></div>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54e84460ce293/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the addition of a fan in the Switch 2's dock, we all knew that Nintendo's new console would probably kick out a bit more heat than its predecessor in order to manage the more technically demanding games.</p>
<p>According to some folks in Japan, however (thanks, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/">Nintendo Soup</a>), their consoles are actually overheating. Multiple users have taken to X to relay instances in which their games have crashed, the consoles' fans have gone into overdrive, or, in one case, their system simply became too hot to hold.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwmoxp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://x.com/x1010_q" tabindex="-1">@x1010_q</a> stated (via machine translation) "Switch 2 overheating. Too intense, I couldn’t even hold the console. Without a fan, you can’t play for long". Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/JPSjxSmUMy170" tabindex="-1">@JPSjxSmUMy170</a> simply said "Switch 2 is overheating; the fan noise is annoying".</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether the Switch 2 consoles are definitely, irrefutably overheating in these cases, however. As demonstrated with <a href="https://x.com/p_typhoon" tabindex="-1">@p_typhoon</a>'s tweet below, they merely mention that "The fan's going nuts" after an instance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> crashing, but we can't say for sure that this is the root cause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First freeze on Switch 2.<br>
Talked to an old man in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it froze.<br>
The screen's still moving (background grass swaying in the wind), but I can't control anything.<br>
The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating.<br>
Auto-save saved my butt...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind the environmental conditions in which the Switch 2 is being played. <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68567/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-dock-becomes-hot-and-stops-outputting-to-tv-or-charging">Nintendo itself advises</a> that users should "not place the console near a heat source, or in a location where heat can easily build up", while also ensuring that "the air vent on the dock is not covered or obstructed".</p>
<p>So this is clearly a <em>potential</em> issue that Nintendo is very much aware of. We can certainly attest to the console getting rather warm after a certain amount of time but – touch wood – we've not yet had any instances of the Switch 2 overheating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NetEase Games made a lot of significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> announcements during yesterday's Global Annual Showcase. Annual version 2.0 is now available and every player can claim 11 Lightforge Ingots for free by participating in the new events and completing tasks. Players can earn additional rewards through in-game activities, such as playing the Dreamland Wonder mini-games, rescuing the giant Chefosaurus Rex, and checking in daily.</p>



<p>The developers also launched a new PvE scenario called Endless Dream. It's a Nightmare-themed world filled with bizarre, psychedelic elements, such as CRT TVs and abandoned amusement parks. This haunted, odd world is filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>



<p>The entire world map is available from the start in Endless Dream. This strange world is a shattered reflection of the subconscious, divided into Dream Zones and Nightmare Areas. To survive, players must face supernatural environmental hazards and be wary of the new Confusion mechanic.</p>



<p>Those who wish to purify the Dream Zones must contend with their guardians: Light Dreamers, Deep Dreamers, and the most lethal of all, Eternal Dreamers. These new Deviants include Agony, a humanoid/transformer hybrid that emits electricity; Misery, a statue with flowers growing within its body that attacks by detonating itself; and Naivety, an adorable teddy bear with a haunted TV in its belly.</p>



<p>Once Human players have the power to shape the land in the Endless Dream. They can freely build offensive and defensive structures without territorial restrictions. Exploring the world and conquering its nightmares unlocks additional traits and influences the outcome through a real-time, five-stage dynamic progression based on how efficiently players purge the nightmares. This results in one of multiple endings.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NetEase also provided updates on console ports and a spin-off. When it comes to consoles, Once Human is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, with the ports nearing completion.</p>



<p>As for the PvP spin-off, Once Human: RaidZone is set to launch on July 30 and it's all about combat. Players start with nothing and must gather weapons and building materials from the land. Forming alliances with other players is necessary, but only temporary. You must pick your allies carefully and be ready to turn on them when needed.</p>



<p>The entire RaidZone map is unrestricted, and players can strike each other's bases at any time. The Deviation Powers from the base game have also been reworked for the PvP experience, so players can unleash the might of Deviations on their foes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-switch-2-units-are-overheating-according-to-reports.1235811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, most of which are coming from Japan, some Nintendo Switch 2 units may be overheating. At least, that's what users are assuming when they see sudden freezes and crashes while the console's fans run at max speed in the vain attempt to cool down the hardware.</p>



<p>This happens with all kinds of Nintendo Switch 2 games, from the most taxing ones like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 to way less complex titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma.</p>



<p>A few reports came in from Western gamers, too. Reddit user NitroWalrus732 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4918o/switch_2_overheating/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-units-allegedly-overheating-users-report-issues-while-playing-cyberpunk-2077-and-less-power-hungry-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked. I was also running at 2k resolution which probably wasn't helping but this is still worrying. Anybody else experienced this? Wondering if I could have a faulty system or maybe TotK is just that intensive.</em></p>



<p>If you're experiencing similar issues, there's not much that you can do except clean the air vents and turn off the console for a while to let it cool down. If the issues persist, you should send it to Nintendo for repair.</p>



<p>Regardless of such problems, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to sell extremely well. According to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest estimates</a>, the hybrid handheld/home console may have surpassed 5 million units sold in June, although these are not official figures. Nintendo's own fiscal year forecast of 15 million units should be easily beaten by March 2026.</p>

We imagine those words will be hugely reassuring for those still in a job. It also said it hopes to empower its remaining employees to "spend more time focusing on meaningful work by leveraging new technologies and capabilities." What could that possibly be shorthand for?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite having racked up a fair bit of experience laying off workers (this is the fourth major layoff round at the company in 18 months), Microsoft still doesn't seem capable of treating the situation with the respect it deserves. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsytyc3p6223">Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> noted that staff at ZeniMax Online Studios had their Slack abruptly deactivated, leaving many employees in existential limbo while they waited to hear whether or not they still had a future at the company.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-2k-studio-cat-daddy-games-lays-off-staff" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: 2K mobile studio Cat Daddy Games is making layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, IGN obtained an internal memo from Xbox boss Phil Spencer in which he chose to kick off the layoff announcement by telling Xbox staffers how the company's platform, hardware, and video game roadmap have "never looked stronger."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hey Siri, show me the definition of "tone deaf."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm now dangerously close to turning this into a scathing op-ed, so I'll bite my tongue and instead offer you a rather sobering rundown of this week's biggest headlines.

The company's refusal to answer questions about the true impact of the cuts means the industry is still attempting to understand the full scale of the situation, but right now it seems like hundreds of people have lost their jobs across major studios such Rare, King, ZeniMax Online Studios, Turn 10, and The Initiative—the latter of which appears to have been completely shuttered. Reports indicate notable projects have also been cancelled, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everwild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Perfect Dark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and an unnamed MMORPG that had been in development for years.

Microsoft refuted that rumor in a statement to The Verge and insisted "Phil is not retiring anytime soon."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds loses leadership team"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team">Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds loses leadership team</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The co-founders of Unknown Worlds, the studio behind Subnautica, made sudden exits this week. Parent company Krafton broke the news and suggested it tried to convince CEO Ted Gill, game director Charlie Cleveland, and technical director Max McGuire to stick with the studio in some capacity. It's unclear why the trio exited or what their departure means for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Subnautica 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which will apparently launch in early access later this year.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Unity senior client partner Rod Stafford jailed for 22 years over sexual offenses"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-senior-client-partner-rod-stafford-jailed-for-sexual-offences">Former Unity senior client partner Rod Stafford jailed for 22 years over sexual offenses</a></h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-closes-the-initiative-and-cancels-its-perfect-dark-reboot" target="_self" data-discover="true">Xbox closes The Initiative and cancels its Perfect Dark reboot</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Earlier this week, former Unity senior client partner Rod Stafford was sentenced to 22 years in prison in the UK after being charged with 33 sexual offences. Stafford represented Unity at a host of industry events in his role, sitting on panels and giving talks in the name of the engine maker. That's despite Stafford having a documented history of sexual misconduct dating back to his time in the armed forces in 2004. Unity has failed to address how it managed to hire someone with a public history of sexual misconduct and place them in a position of power. The company has also refused to clarify when Stafford departed, but Game Developer understands he attended GDC in March 2025 as a member of the Unity delegation—just weeks before his trial began.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Update: Lost Records developer Don't Nod confirms layoffs at Montreal studio"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-don-t-nod-lays-off-an-undisclosed-number-of-staff">Update: Lost Records developer Don't Nod confirms layoffs at Montreal studio</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We heard reports of layoffs at Don't Nod Montreal last week and the company eventually decided to confirm the news.

The payouts come after a 2023 settlement between the FTC and Epic, which denied intentionally misleading players but agreed to pay $245 million in compensation to settle the issue. The FTC previously issued refunds worth $72 million in December 2024, meaning it has now paid out almost $200 million in compensation—and there's still more to come.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Myst developer Cyan Worlds is making more layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/myst-developer-cyan-worlds-is-making-more-layoffs">Myst developer Cyan Worlds is making more layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">After laying off half of its workforce earlier this year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Cyan Worlds confirmed it's cutting even more jobs.

A court in France issued suspended prison terms to all three men. Former editorial vice president François was convicted on a charge of attempted sexual assault and handed a suspended three-year term. Former chief creative officer Hascoet was hit with an 18-month suspended sentence, while former games director Patrux received a 12-month suspended sentence.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="FBC: Firebreak Launch Wasn't What Studio Hoped For, But Remedy Isn't Giving Up"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/">FBC: Firebreak Launch Wasn't What Studio Hoped For, But Remedy Isn't Giving Up</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via GameSpot //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Remedy told GameSpot its first self-published title, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FBC: Firebreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has underwhelmed at launch. The co-op shooter landed in mid-June but estimates indicate it had fewer than 300 concurrent players on Steam as of last week. Remedy has now conceded it "had hoped for a better launch." The title, also available on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, attracted 1 million players across all platforms but now the Finnish studio must figure out how to keep them around for the long haul. "The team here is super-motivated to continue building the game and responding to player feedback," said studio comms director Thomas Puha. "We already reacted during launch week with patch 1.2, making some big changes to the game. As Remedy does, we'll do things with smaller teams in our way and try to solve challenges creatively."</span><br></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.
