While he didn't really think of Final Fantasy as "competition" per se — while they're both RPGs, their approaches to storytelling are quite different  — he did acknowledge that he was "definitely paying attention to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for," Horii said, reflecting on how the games differ. "But there's one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you're not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games.

Developer Sparrow Night's newspaper management game gives the player one week to report out, print, and distribute the weekly paper—and do everything in between, be it decorating the office with plants, managing power struggles across the city, or optimizing workstations. It all matters in determining what role your newspaper will play in a fictional '30s version of New York City.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Sparrow Night was formed in 2019 by Jan-Maarten Nachtegeller and Stefan Rijsmus, Nachtegeller found the inspiration for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in 2016 after reading a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/feature/making-the-new-york-times">Mashable photo feature</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on the New York Times in the '40s, in which dozens of black-and-white photos showcased the news-making process from the time. Reporters smoke cigarettes at messy desks in a crowded newsroom. People at typewriters record messages received over wires from around the world. Paper falls from printers and onto the floor, which is no longer visible under the white sheets. Typersetters build out molds to create newspaper plates for printing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a complicated process—and perfect to translate into a video game. It wasn't until 2017, though, when Nachtegeller started to conceptualize what a game could look like, after playing Weappy Studio's&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This Is The Police</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I instantly thought about the newspaper project," he said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/creating-the-card-based-rpg-battle-suit-aces-game-developer-podcast-ep-59" target="_self" data-discover="true">Creating the card-based RPG Battle Suit Aces - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 59</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rijsmus and Nachtegeller began working on&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in late 2018 into 2019. Bart van de Sande joined the team in 2020, contributing as both a developer and the composer behind &nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s music. More team members joined later in the process, including support from publisher Twin Sails Interactive. Over the past six years, Sparrow Night has been iterating on the core idea of the game—based on the newspaper processes of companies like the New York Times—to create a compelling management game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What appeals to me about&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is that it's a little bit of everything," van de Sande said. "If you're really a history freak, you will like the game. But if you like managing a conveyor belt, so to speak, that's what it boils down to."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player takes over a struggling newspaper and rebuilds it nearly from scratch. They must renovate both the office and the ethical standards of the newspaper—balancing the need to publish accurate, newsworthy stories about world events with salacious pieces that bring in tons of eyeballs. Then there's advertising—which takes up precious space in the paper—and different groups lobbying for good coverage. You need to keep your employees, readers, and the looming mafia happy to succeed. It's quite the highwire act, which makes it a compelling management simulator.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/finding-smart-shortcuts-in-a-short-hike-postmortem-unlocking-the-vault-4" target="_self" data-discover="true">Finding smart shortcuts in A Short Hike postmortem - Unlocking the Vault #4</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're just a couple of guys goofing around.

We will get a bit more structured for the next projects, more streamlined, but we shouldn't lose our looseness"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sparrow Night spent a lot of time balancing the real process of newspaper-making during that time with compelling gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;needed to be fairly accurate, but some accuracy got in the way of simple, clear cut gameplay. Nachtgeller pointed to the role of editors in the process as something that needed to be cut. "The editor normally has a way bigger role, and that's something we always struggled with," he said. It made the game too much in the weeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of development,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;went through several iterations. "We've done many iterations on different concepts in the game," van de Sande said. "We're making a game about running a newspaper. But how do you actually translate that to a game? It's a very difficult subject to make concrete rules."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was originally released as an early access title in February 2024, which let Sparrow Night keep iterating while receiving feedback from the playerbase. Van de Sande said that process was as much a financial decision as a creative one.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/marvel-rivals-introduced-a-pve-mode-to-reduce-the-pressure-of-competition" target="_self" data-discover="true">Marvel Zombies was built to give Marvel Rivals players a breather</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team had already been toiling away on its own for years, tweaking systems and cutting and removing content. Nachtgeller said the news items system is one of those pieces of the game that went through a lot of changes before they eventually landed on "an elegant solution.", But it meant removing some of the complexities they originally fleshed out. Van de Sande said there were six or seven versions of that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Something we had at the beginning was that the newspaper was almost a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;game in itself, like you had to fit stuff in," Nachtgeller said. "You had to fit stuff, and there was too much emphasis on being an arcade element. That got taken out. We also had a fully functional power system with cords that you had to bring all the way to the tower, but that took away too much from the newspaper making."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But early access was a chance to recoup some costs and get direct feedback from more players. It was a way to ease into the release of a new game, which Nachtgeller explained can be quite daunting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't know how people do it without the community test," he said. "Without having the feedback, it's even scarier to release a game. It already feels very scary, but you at least know that quite a lot of people had fun in the early access, so you can bank on that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, Sparrow Night will spend some time monitoring&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release and fixing any bugs and issues that arise. When they're ready to move onto a new project, there are some learnings the team will take with them. The first thing that they'll do, Nachtgeller said, is hone into the core gameplay early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost no project that's exactly like how it started, but having more strict boundaries does help," Nachtgeller said, while noting thatSparrow Night wants to keep its development structure loose enough to allow for experimentation. "It's been quite loose, and that's one of our strengths," van de Sande said. "We're just a couple of guys goofing around. We will get a bit more structured for the next projects, more streamlined, but we shouldn't lose our looseness, because it's also what makes it fun, and what makes&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;stand out, because we're not your ordinary game development studio."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/news-tower-is-designed-to-nourish-your-inner-history-freak-]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a patch this morning, fixing an exploit that allowed players to shoot quicker than intended with the help of quick-use items, which was allowing some to dominate fights with other players.</p>
<p>This was best used with the El Toro shotgun, a close-ranged powerhouse balanced with its low rate of fire. With this exploit, players were unloading multiple shells in quick succession, causing havoc on live servers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdOeQ96Ecg">Here's an excellent video by Gravez that shows it in action</a>. This was dubbed "double pumping" by some members of the community, as you could often knock out a light-shield user with two well placed shots with the El Toro. Stop laughing.</p>
<p>The way it worked was simple: you would shoot, which initiates the re-chambering animation, and then quickly press the quick use button during this animation, followed by the button for the weapon slot of your weapon mid-animation. This would cancel the animation early with a new round ready to go, slicing down the reload time significantly.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are other fixes included in the patch that deserve their flowers. All locked rooms across the game have exploit mitigation mechanics added, following weeks of players finding inventive ways to break in without keycards. Players can also no longer push other people around by jumping on each other's backs, so no more funny business.</p>
<p>There are also some more minor fixes, such as main menu texture problems going the way of the dodo, lighting artifacts upon entering a map being removed, and the correct voice options actually being reflected on restarting the game.</p>
<p>It's not the most bombastic patch, but it is one with a massive impact on the experience for high-end players. PvP is now fairer, and you'll actually need keycards to get the best loot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent Polish developer Rebel Wolves is hard at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut open world action roleplaying game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be published by Bandai Namco</a>.</p>



<p>The studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">founded</a> in 2022 by former CD Projekt RED developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with some investment from NetEase</a>), and indeed, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks a lot like The Witcher III: Wild Hunt on the surface</a>. However, the game has been designed to offer much greater freedom to players, as outlined by Game Director Konrad Tomaskiewicz <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Eurogamer</a> at the recent Golden Joystick Awards 2025:</p>



<p><em>No, there's no main quest. You build your experience from the quests you encounter. You know where your enemy is. You can attack this place anytime you want to. It's up to you if you want to do it by yourself, or if you want to build yourself, find the powerful items, develop your character, or do some quests and find allies to help you do it. We want to bring video games closer to pen-and-paper RPGs and give you the freedom to experience what you want to experience.</em></p>



<p>When asked by the interviewer if the concept in The Blood of Dawnwalker was kind of similar to Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance games, Tomaskiewicz said the approach was rather more similar to the first two Fallout installments:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance is not a bad example, but still they have the main story that develops; you have the open world and the main quest which is leading you. In our game it's different. Our game is more similar in this area to the old Fallout, the first and second games, where you have a clear goal and everything is optional - you decide. You travel the world, you decide what you want to do. There is no main quest.</em></p>



<p>On a related note, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/dawnwalker-will-have-serious-consequences-for-both-action-and-inaction-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously noted</a> that The Blood of Dawnwalker would feature heavy consequences for both action and inaction, highlighting its strong roleplaying elements.</p>

            <p>Valve have blocked card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flick-solitaire">Flick Solitaire</a> from the Russian version of Steam, after federal censorship body Roskomnadzor contacted the platform holder to order its removal for "promoting non-traditional sexualities". </p>
<p>In a letter, Valve have also reproached developers Flick Games for failing "to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be". Flick Solitaire is still available in Russia via the iOS and Android storefronts, however, despite Roskomnadzor sending similar notes to Apple and Google. As of writing, Valve appear to be the only platform who have caved to Russian state requests to censor the game.</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from the latest edition of <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, written by George E. Osborn. To start from the beginning, Flick Solitaire released on iOS and Android in June 2020. It's a free-to-play collection of Solitaire variations distinguished by the titular flick controls and some lavish decks from independent artists, which include cards with queer themes such as Amee Wilsons' Queer Chameleon Deck (pictured above) and Ollie T's Drag Deck. I can't say I'm compelled by the familiar option to grind for unlockable decks, or spend real money on in-game coins or a subscription pass, but I do think some of the designs are beautiful. </p>

<p>The game has been available in Russia since its mobile launch - it's the game's second largest market, in fact - though Flick Games demonetised it for Russian players following the Vladimir Putin government's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, to avoid generating any revenue for the aggressor.</p><p>Then, on 1st October 2025, Flick Solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">launched in Steam early access</a>. The developers say they had also demonetised the Steam version for Russian players, while noting that they can't do anything about platform features like store credit that might allow people to get around the block. For context, Steam currently doesn't allow direct purchases by Russian players, in accordance with western sanctions, so Russian buyers have to make use of workarounds such as third-party key resellers.</p>
<p>On 28th October, Flick Games say they received official notices from Roskomnadzor, advising them that they had broken a 2006 law against the promotion of "non-traditional sexualities" - the VGIM article doesn't specify, but I imagine it's referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_anti-LGBTQ_law">this infamous amendment</a> prohibiting the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors. The censor also cc'd Flick Games on emails to Apple, Google and the developers' web host, ordering the removal of Flick Solitaire from their platforms.</p>
<p>According to VGIM's report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's request. Apple acknowledged the censor's letter but assured Flick Games that it "did not affect the studio's standing with the platform", as Osborn puts it. Valve, however, added a country restriction for Flick Solitaire, without giving Flick Games the opportunity to contest or appeal the decision. Here's the text of their accompanying message to the developers, as passed on by VGIM.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Partner,</p>
<p>Your game, FLICK SOLITAIRE (3690460), was determined by Roskomnadzor to be in violation of Russian requirements for distribution. We've added a country restriction to the game so that it no longer appears in Russia.</p>
<p>We also want to remind you that you promised Valve under the Steam Distribution Agreement that your game complies with all applicable laws. Therefore, it is your responsibility to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be.</p></blockquote>
<p>VGIM say they've contacted Valve for a comment on Flick Games's account, but have yet to receive a response. I'll follow up with a request from RPS.</p>
<p>Valve have a track record for restricting access to games on Steam to appease draconian governments. In China, the platform holder operate a separate version of Steam with games licensed by regulators, though a huge number of Chinese players use the international version of Steam to get hold of unapproved releases. Individual cases of Valve bending for Chinese censors include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">the removal</a> of brilliant Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> from sale, after it was found to contain a derogatory reference to the country's president Xi Jinping. As for Steam's operations in Russia, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">boasted in October 2024</a> that they had pushed Valve to remove "over 260 materials containing illegal content", without going into specifics. </p><p>Valve have also been in the headlines lately for delisting or removing a swathe of games with sexual themes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">at the behest of international payment processing networks</a>. Here, as in the case of Flick Solitaire, the platform holder has generally avoided taking a stance on the games in question, preferring to frame it all in the technicalities of compliance with governments or financial institutions, while gesturing towards catch-all prohibitions on "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". Valve are also currently at loggerheads with Italian developers Santa Ragione over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">their refusal to publish the horror game Horses</a>, apparently in response to a scene of a young woman riding a naked slave, though this pre-dates the payment processor crackdown.</p>
<p>Queer people in Russia face enormous oppression. In December 2022, Putin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">effectively outlawed</a> public expression of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by signing a bill against "LGBT propaganda". In June 2023, Russia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-sexologists-target-homosexuality-other-disorders-under-new-rules-2023-06-29/">took steps</a> toward reinstating the idea of homosexuality being a mental illness. It's currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66200194">illegal</a> in Russia for trans people to change their legal gender or receive gender-affirming care. Same-sex marriages or civil unions are also forbidden.</p>
<p>Valve have professed support for queer developers and players on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-now-has-an-official-lgbtq-tag-hub-page">adding a LGBTQ+ store tag in 2019</a> and hosting <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/lgbtq-sale/">LGBTQ+ sales</a> among other events, but these seem like trivial shows of positive optics next to the company's on-going willingness to meet the demands of repressive regimes. I'll update this piece if Valve respond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest advertised features for Black Ops 7 multiplayer was open lobbies. For the first time in years, Treyarch was removing the SBMM shackles from Call of Duty players, offering a more open and varied matchmaking experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a> is not supposed to be the main factor considered for Black Ops 7 matchmaking. The game’s open lobbies are supposed to represent this new ideology, but CoD content creator TheXclusiveAce has conducted a small test to check if everything is as transparent as it seems.</p>







<h2 id="h-sbmm-could-be-affecting-black-ops-7-lobbies-more-than-you-think">SBMM Could Be Affecting Black Ops 7 Lobbies More Than You Think</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What’s the truth? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the creator’s ‘XclusiveReloaded’ YouTube channel, they asked an important question in a new video: “Is Skill Really ‘Minimally Considered’ in Black Ops 7?”</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is supposed to favour certain conditions, such as region, proximity, and numerous other factors, before taking into account a player’s skill level—the final parameter being the heartbeat of SBMM. </p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce opened by discussing the ongoing narrative in the community that SBMM is stronger and more prevalent than advertised. Many think it’s been ramped up as of late. This is where the renowned data tracker compared some numbers.</p>







<p>“I do feel my experience has been changing as time has been going on. I have been feeling like my matchmaking times are going up, my connection quality is no longer nearly as consistent as it was early on, and as it was in the open matchmaking in the beta build of the game. On top of that, I’ve been noticing that more often than not, my lobbies are a lot more difficult than they were in the first few days.”</p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce used two accounts to test their theory: Their regular account the play the majority of Black Ops 7 on, and their bot account that’s sole purpose is for offline testing, as they constantly check weapons and attachments to find meta loadouts with it. They played at the same time of day, and kept the variables and controllable factors consistent.</p>



<p>In 10 matches, the creator used traditional Team Deathmatch matchmaking to see the results for each account. The final stats are quite interesting.</p>



<p>The main account’s 10 matches took 34 seconds on average to find a game, compared to 28 seconds on the bot account. 6 seconds isn’t the end of the world, but leans ever-so-slightly in favor of SBMM. However, the average ping was a different story.</p>



<p>The average ping for the main account was 42ms, whereas it was 25ms for the bot account. TheXclusiveAce says the best ping they can get is 20ms, and the bot account was within 5ms of this in eight matches out of 10. The main account achieved this feat <em>once</em>, with several games reaching into the high 40s and low 50s.</p>



<p>SBMM generally takes longer on average, as the system has to find players in your skill bracket, which means it might have to go further around the world to find players, which adds more time to matchmaking, and can influence ping. This data and study aren’t conclusive—due to it being such a small data sample—but the initial numbers are eyebrow-raising and only support the narrative that Black Ops 7’s SBMM might be stronger than first thought.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0bb4ac7f3e954"><a title="Nintendo Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb4ac7f3e954/nintendo-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore after reaching an agreement with Bandai Namco for the transfer of shares next year.</p>
<p>Described in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html">the press release</a> as being "for the purpose of strengthening its development structure," BNSS will become a Nintendo subsidiary and go by the new name of Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
<p>The deal is planned to go through on 1st April 2026, with Nintendo acquiring 80% of shares, with the rest to follow some time after "once the subsidiary’s operations have stabilized."</p>
<p>Nintendo has partnered with Bandai Namco on several first-party projects, with this studio having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (contributing concept art, character modelling, environment modelling, and animation, according to <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/news/games/splatoon-3/">the studio's website</a>) as well as various high-profile Bandai Namco games. Here's a description of the studio from <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/">Bandai Namco's site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, our studio in Singapore has worked on a variety of iconic game titles such as TEKKEN, ACE COMBAT, SOUL CALIBUR and Taiko no Tatsujin. From concept to art, and all the way to development, we cover it all. Explore our portfolio of game and demo titles by selecting any of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo anticipates that the acquisition "will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year."</p>
<p>This latest acquisition follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-states-its-intention-to-acquire-more-development-teams">acknowledgement earlier in November</a> that the company intended to expand its internal development teams. Nintendo Pictures was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/nintendo-publishes-job-listings-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">another addition in 2022</a>, followed by Shiver Entertainment's integration <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/shiver-entertainment-has-updated-its-website-after-being-acquired-by-nintendo">in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For reference, here's the full text from the investor announcement:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest ARC Raiders Patch Destroys One of the Most Annoying Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-destroys-annoying-exploits/</link>
            <guid>1366273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has just pushed out a small but mighty update for ARC Raiders – 1.4.0. This patch addresses some of the game’s most critical bugs and exploits, including one that has been plaguing players for the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It’s a graphical and quality-of-life thing more than anything else, and while no <strong>new content </strong>has been added with the 1.4.0 update, the improvements included in the change are being welcomed with open arms by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-locked-door-exploits-in-arc-raiders">No More Locked Door Exploits in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The full list of content and bug fixes included in the ARC Raiders 1.4.0 update is being appreciated by fans of the ambitious extraction adventure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li>



<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick-use item and back.</li>



<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low-resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li>



<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li>



<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li>



<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>The locked door exploits were a huge bugbear for players legitimately using keys (which are often single-use) to enter high-tier areas, only to find that somebody had already scooped loot from the room without needing to bring in the key at all, some of which are drastically rare.</p>



<p>With this update, players attempting to access locked rooms without keys will now be incinerated. That’s right, <em>burned to death</em>.</p>



<p>The other bug (read: exploit) that was disturbing users everywhere was the ‘double pump’ gun exploit that allowed users to swap to a quick-use item and back again, flicking between two shotguns to produce an alarming rate of fire and damage output.</p>



<p>It was seen being used even by the game’s most prominent streamers, and it made close-quarters PvP almost unwinnable.</p>



<p>That has also been addressed by this small patch, which is available to download and install <strong>right now</strong> on all platforms.</p>







<p>Are you grateful to see the back of these exploits? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has ruled out an appearance from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> at The Game Awards this year, despite its cinematic reveal trailer premiering during last year’s show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While acknowledging The Witcher 4’s nomination in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards 2025, joint-CEO of CD Projekt, Michał Nowakowski, took to <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to manage expectations, confirming its hotly anticipated sequel is being kept under wraps for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” Nowakowski began. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted — your support means a lot to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that rules out more of The Witcher 4, last seen via a hugely impressive Unreal Engine 5 tech demo in June, any time soon. When might CD Projekt have more to show? Given CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest, perhaps The Game Awards 2026 is a safe bet. According to CD Projekt's latest financial report, 447 people are currently working on The Witcher 4, up slightly from the number reported at the end of July. Clearly, it is CD Projekt's focus right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don’t go expecting anything from Cyberpunk 2, either. CD Projekt recently said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-now-sold-35-million-copies-currently-cd-projekts-main-source-of-revenue-5-years-after-launch">it’s still “laying the foundations” for the sequel</a> while ramping up staff at its development studios. That one’s even further out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we do know of one title that will be at The Game Awards this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-archetype-entertainment">Exodus</a>. The official Twitter page for the game <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that a new Exodus trailer will be shown at The Game Awards on December 11. Exodus is a new sci-fi RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, a studio founded by former BioWare developers James Ohlen, Chad Robertson, and Drew Karpyshyn, and published by Wizards of the Coast.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for that, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">all the nominations for The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <p>The next World of Warcraft expansion, Midnight, will be released 2nd March 2026, Blizzard has announced.</p>
<p>This is the second expansion in the Worldsoul Saga trilogy, which began last year with the launch of The War Within, and will conclude, at some point, with The Last Titan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-cool-world-of-warcraft-stuff-not-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">The Midnight expansion brings several exciting additions to World of Warcraft</a>, the most notable of which is the long-awaited new player housing system, which not only gives you a customisable place to stay, but lets groups of people arrange the locations of their homes into neighbourhoods. "It's kind of a sociological experiment," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has said about housing before</a>.</p>
<p>But there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">some controversy also swirling around the housing system which is related to the new real-money currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a>, with which you will be able to buy furniture and furnishings and other cosmetic items. Hearthsteel, it's called. We'll get a better sense of how this currency and housing works when housing early access opens on 2nd December for people who've pre-ordered Midnight.</p><p>Other expansion features include a new subterranean-themed Alliance race called the Haranir, and a new darkness-themed and damage-dealing Demon Hunter specialisation called the Devourer. Midnight will also take us back to Blood Elf land, to Quel'Thalas and Silvermoon City, which were destroyed before but will be repaired now.</p>
<p>There's also a new open-world PvE-focused Prey system coming to the game, whereby you can mark yourself as 'prey' to enable a hunt-and-be-hunted system that introduces roaming bosses to the world, and in three tiers of difficulty.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>







<h2 id="h-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-to-become-nintendo-studios-singapore">Bandai Namco Studios Singapore to Become Nintendo Studios Singapore</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Partnership. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the DS was gifted one of the all-time great <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alien_isolation">Alien</a> franchise games in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/aliens_infestation">Aliens: Infestation</a>, a slick and polished Metroidvania that nails its mix of puzzling, platforming, signature series tension, and great big scary extraterrestrials (alongside their face-hugging pals). Hey, we even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/10/aliens_infestation_ds">gave it an 8/10 back at release</a>, so you just know it's verified fresh, or whatever they're saying these days.</p>
<p>It's a very good game that you should definitely play, in short. Even if you don't like Metroidvanias or aliens. Because of one song.</p>
<p>As we were happily reminded this very morning, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social/post/3m6lqhazfs22a">via a much-appreciated social media post,</a> of the ending credits song for Aliens: Infestation (below), written by the very same band (Guyz Nite) who penned the also wonderful <a href="https://youtu.be/dH34jMqHBmw?si=9ZQDc0uf6d8PkmUg">Die Hard song</a> (warning for NSFW swearing, but otherwise a treat and a wonderful Xmas song to boot).</p>

<p>If you can listen to this and somehow resist immediately diving back in to replay the whole flipping game all over again, you've got more willpower than this writer. And shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social">@MrHallenback</a> for the Thursday morning levity!</p>

			<p>PC and consoles sent to repair shops come with all sorts of issues, but a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 </a>unit sent to a shop in the United States definitely wins the award for the most disgusting. The system needed to be debugged, in the most literal sense.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Dystopia</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dvdgameexchangeutah/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DVD Game Exchange Repair Center</a>, a repair shop based in Orem, Utah, recently received a broken PlayStation 5 for repairs. After opening up the system, and verifying that the power supply was not to blame, it was discovered that the system was likely no longer working due to a serious bug. Or rather, many of them.</p>



<p>After discovering cockroach droppings all over the system's components, which is disgusting enough, the repair shop rep showed in the video how cockroaches were actively crawling out of the console. The truly literal "debugging," however, will have to be conducted by the owner of the system. The repain center wrapped up the console in plastic to prevent the insects from escaping before sending it back.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He runs a console-repair business. Started the diagnostics, saw what was inside, and immediately decided to pack it up and send it back. Can’t even blame him. <a href="https://t.co/QIrKXSsWqw">pic.twitter.com/QIrKXSsWqw</a></p>— Financial Dystopia (@financedystop) <a href="https://twitter.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Scouring the X thread, other users reported all sorts of disgusting stories, including one about a PC tower case with a black widow spider infestation, so this cockroach-infested PlayStation 5 is hardly the first system to become a nest for bugs. </p>



<p>Still, this stands as a warning to all console and PC users: clear your systems frequently, as they can house something much worse than dust. A small investment of time cleaning now could save you from a truly stomach-churning repair bill later.</p>



<p>Besides having to clean their PlayStation 5 systems as often as possible to prevent issues like the above, owners of older models also need to be aware of the known <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid metal issues caused by a design flaw</a>, which can cause permanent damage to the system. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank">Although it has been addressed in more recent models</a>, it remains</span> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a widely reported issue.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next big event will act as a narrative sequel to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, bringing back Uma Thurman as Beatrice Kiddo as well as Yuki Yibari, the sister of one of Kill Bill Volume 1's antagonists.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge, which will premiere in Fortnite on the 30th November at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>In addition, you can watch it in real life on an actual cinema screen on the 5th December,  where select theatres across the USA, Canada, and the UK will be showing the animated film as well as Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair (a combination of both original movies). Those who purchase a ticket to see this real-world premiere will get a code that can be redeemed for the Gogo Yubari outfit. This appears to be the only way to get the skin as of writing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to sit down and watch the film yourself, you can log in to Fortnite at any point between now and the 1st December to earn a Yuki Yubari in-game skin. She, as you may have guessed, is a main presence in Yuki's revenge.</p><p>This isn't the first time Tarantino has used animation to expand upon Kill Bill. Chapter three of the film, the Origins of O-Ren, used 2D animation to show the backstory of one of its main characters. However, this was included in the movie itself. This is the first time anything Kill Bill has been portrayed away from the silver screen.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players. We'll have to wait and see whether some beloved gory action cinema can replicate similar results.</p>

            <p>UK studio Splash Damage has entered a studio-wide consultation process ahead of extensive redundancies.</p>
<p>The studio has suffered difficulties this year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellation of its Transformers: Reactivate project</a> back in January, which left roles "at risk of redundancy". Then, in September, it was acquired by unnamed private equity investors (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). Previously it was owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, which acquired the studio back in 2020.</p>
<p>Staff were notified of redundancies yesterday, and a public statement was shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">LinkedIn</a>.

			<p>Sweet Surrender is a VR roguelike, and it comes with everything that label brings. You’ll be making your way through the environment picking off enemies, looking for weapons, cash, and upgrades, and swearing every time an enemy shaves off a bit of your health and you come closer to the end of a run. But it’s all in VR, and it’s cool throwing daggers that are somehow poisonous to robots. Oh yeah, everything is a robot – including you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sweet Surrender - PS VR2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcibo6YqOEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Originally launching in 2021 for Quest and PC VR, this PSVR 2 port has come after a bunch of upgrades and additions tot the game. There’s some great twists to the roguelike format and general gameplay, thanks to Sweet Surrender being in VR. The upgrades you can find throughout a level are chips that are fitted into slots by your wrists, for example, but the boosts they provide will only apply to the weapons in that hand, forcing you to really think about what upgrades you’re choosing and where you put them. A revolver that usually only shoots one, very powerful bullet before reloading on an arm with upgrades that triple its capacity and double its damage is a force to be reckoned with, but maybe something that heals you when you find cash would be smarter, to make up for the inevitable health loss.</p>


<p>The weapons themselves are mostly the standard fare – pistol, shotgun, SMG, and so on – but there are more interesting options, such as a katana that burns with plasma when you pull the trigger, or a spear that can shoot electricity. Melee weapons are particularly risky to use, as they force you to get into melee range, giving enemies a good opportunity to shoot you full of holes. Thankfully there are also a bunch of other items you can find, such as grenades, boosters that increase damage, and a holographic shield that feels pretty satisfying to use. At least, until you misjudge it and it runs out of energy in time for a bunch of bullets to the face.</p>


<p>When all this comes together the combat is pretty satisfying, rewarding accuracy for targeting weakspots on the various robot enemies. It’s fast and frenetic, and you can quickly lose a lot of health by getting surrounded. In classic shooter fashion, I found that the best way to fight is to find a bottleneck and take enemies out as they come into view. It does make you feel a bit like a robotic assassin, which is cool, but after a while the temptation to wade in with a plasma sword and a shield comes back because it’s more fun. It’s just that it’s more fun for less time, because you’ll die quicker.</p>
<p>Once you’ve had a few runs, Sweet Surrender starts to feel a bit limited and repetitive. You do have to expect repetition in a roguelike, but you will start to see the same rooms and layouts repeating themselves very quickly. The upgrades and weapons you find can also duplicate and repeat themselves within a run, so there’s limits to how far you can really extend your build.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that this game has very little of the meta progression that has come to define run-based gaming in recent years – it’s a more classic rogulike than a modern roguelite. There are different classes to unlock – Medic, Grenadier, Sniper and Reaper – but there’s no overarching upgrades beyond that, and they don’t actually change the experience all that much beyond some boosts to certain types of damage or more healing. I’ve settled into building my character with one arm for shooting and the other for healing every single time I play, regardless of the class I’ve chosen. Beyond that, you can get shortcuts to let you skip areas, which is nice, but does mean you’re skipping past the items in those areas as well.</p>

<p>Then there are a bunch of immersion breakers and frustraters. Whilst implanting chips into your arm for your upgrades is cool, the experience of actually doing it is a bit of a pain. Just viewing the UI to see your current upgrades is fiddly, requiring a precise twist of your arm that can sometimes trigger in combat and get in the way. I’ve also found the controls to be very finicky for accessing hip holsters,&nbsp;shoulder holsters, and chest item storage. I’m constantly grabbing the wrong thing, including the rifle on your back when you’re trying to get the pistol from your hip, a good foot away from where your hand is.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of dropping things, as the game doesn’t use the PSVR’s touch sensitive buttons, so you’re only holding an item if you’re specifically pressing the button properly. This becomes uncomfortable, but if you switch it to toggle it becomes nearly impossible to throw things properly, so you just have to live with it. Two handed guns like the assault rifle can be a bit awkward to aim down the sight on as there’s some jitter to the tracking, though you can just use them one handed like a pistol anyway.</p>
<p>Sweet Surrender does look pretty good, with a pseudo-cel shaded art style that allows explosions and things like electricity to stand out a bit. It’s not going to astonish you, but it suits the style of the game pretty well. There some nice attention to detail as well, such as there being an actual trigger on the plasma sword that is pulled when you trigger the plasma. The sound is decent as well, with the best bits being the gun sounds and the warning sounds of nearby traps. Again, nothing to amaze, but it does its job well enough.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>'s Midnight expansion finally has a full release date. It'll arrive on March 2nd, 2026, setting in stone the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-hits-early-access-this-december-but-only-for-midnight-expansion-pre-orderers">new player housing</a> that's debuting in early access this December and bringing forth the bunch of other changes planned alongside its main invasion storyline.</p>
<p>That list of changes includes the introduction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-will-get-a-new-premium-currency-alongside-midnight-for-no-obvious-good-reason-at-all">a new premium currency</a> call Hearthsteel, which you'll need top use to buy a "small fraction" of the house-related bits and bobs being added in with Midnight. Why? Reasons, Blizzard have said.</p>

<p>The date was announced via a fresh trailer, in which old and evil void being Xal’atath has a mid-battle snarky line-off with Lor'themar, the ruler of Azeroth's blood elves. There'll be big void beasties who're well into demonic snarling to battle, as Xal’atath unleashes a Voidstorm that threatens to permanently knock the world's lights off if she succeeds.</p><p>You'll be fighting back, infuriated at the very idea of having to fumble around for switches whenever you leave the new digs the expansion's delivering. To be fair, 'Just go away, I'm trying to pick a carpet which matches my drapes and it's VERY STRESSFUL' sounds like as good a battlecry as any. Three different editions of the expansion will be on offer - base, heroic, and epic - with the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2">date announcement post</a> outlining the extras the latter two include via a big chart.</p>
<p>Outside of the player housing, the update includes a new allied race dubbed the Haranir, a nature-focused gang of humanoids who serve as "ancient guardians of the rootways" in their jungle homeland of Harandar. Harandar's one of four fresh or revamped areas you'll be exploring in Midnight, with the blood elves' Eversong Woods, Amani troll-filled Zul’ Aman and the Voidstorm itself. There are three paths through the main story, with the option to head to Zul'Aman, Harandar, or off on a quest to head off with Arator Windrunner and seek some relics of light all being options after kicking things off in Eversong.</p>
<p>If you're keen to delve into the expansion early, sign-ups for its beta are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/midnight">currently open</a>. Epic edition purchasers get immediate access to said beta as part of their forking over of extra cash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Paradox Interactive has today taken the blame for the poor sales of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long in development sequel launched in October and was met with a ‘mixed’ Steam user review response, with fans saying it failed to meet the expectations they had for the sequel to Troika’s 2004 cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes another flawed but unique and remarkable bite at the jugular, with plenty to love and loathe alike, but I certainly enjoyed my time as an elder vampire at the very least.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after 30 days on sale, <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox has issued a note to financial markets</a> signalling a write-down valued at 355 million SEK (approx. $37 million) of capitalized development costs for Bloodlines 2. This write-down, Paradox said, was based on an updated sales forecast now it has had a month to look at Bloodlines’ commercial performance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said the blame for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’s failure lay at the publisher’s door, not that of The Chinese Room, which had been drafted in to save the project after years of development hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers’ work on the game,” Wester said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal. A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has two expansions planned as part of the game’s Premium Edition, and Paradox said it remains committed to delivering them. “Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year,” Wester added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish game company Paradox’s main focus is on grand strategy games, which have proven enormously successful over the years. Games such as Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Cities: Skylines have all enjoyed big sales, and, in total, Paradox games have six million players each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, falls outside that core grand strategy genre, and always looked like it would struggle upon release. And while its development trouble began years ago, it suffered issues right up to launch. In September, a month before release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-clans-to-base-game-after-fan-outcry-over-launch-dlc">Paradox and The Chinese Room announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans would be available in the base <u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u> experience following a backlash from players</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced"><u>announced</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u></a> all the way back in 2019 with then-developer Hardsuit aiming for a Q1 2020 release window.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-acquires-splatoon-3-co-developer-bandai-namco-singapore/</link>
            <guid>1366204</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> in its most recent financial report that it would acquire more gaming studios? Well, it didn't take long for it to actually happen.</p>



<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in a press release that it has entered an agreement to acquire Bandai Namco Studios Singapore from Bandai Namco. So far, the Singapore studio has functioned in a co-development capacity on Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival, Soul Calibur VI, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, and Splatoon 3. Clearly, it is their work on the latter game that caught Nintendo's attention, as clarified in the announcement:</p>



<p><em>BNSS has contributed to the development of Nintendo titles, including the Splatoon series, and has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo. Considering this business record, Nintendo has made the decision to acquire shares in BNSS to strengthen the development structure of the Nintendo Group.</em></p>



<p>Splatoon 3 was released in September 2022 to generally positive reviews. Our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated it 7.5 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Splatoon 3 may be the series’ best entry yet, featuring some nice gameplay tweaks and new weaponry, an expanded and polished story mode, and more launch content than its predecessors. That said, it’s very much an evolutionary sequel, every bit as iterative as many of the shooter franchises it’s meant to be an alternative to. After a five-year absence, that may not be enough for some. Splatoon 3 is still fun and funky, but Nintendo’s squid shooter series can’t get by on freshness alone forever.</em></p>



<p>However, fans of the third-person shooter series really enjoyed this entry. The game has sold over 12 million units to date, making it the fastest-selling Splatoon game.</p>



<p>80% of the shares of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore will be acquired on April 1, 2026, while the remaining ones will be purchased later, once the new subsidiary's operations have stabilized. BNSS will henceforth be known as Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Holiday season covers the months of November, December, and January. Most of the biggest game releases happen outside of this period, but there’s still plenty of the best games releasing in Holiday 2025.</p>



<p>As 2025 begins to wind down, players are peppered with massive games from August through to October. The season starts again around February and March. Sandwiched in this is the Holiday season, and 2025 still has the odd homerun to knock out of the park first.</p>



<p>Also, for even more holiday shopping guides, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-video-games-for-holiday-2025">The Best Video Games For Holiday 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Carve your own path. Credit to SEGA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s incredible to think it’s been two years since the last FM game. But Sports Interactive finally dropped Football Manager 26, and while it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst games ever rated on Steam</a>, it’s selling like hotcakes!</p>







<p>It would make a nice present under the tree, and is sure to eat up any free time you have.</p>







<h3 id="h-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big sequel. Image from Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dynasty Warrior-like combat and gameplay aesthetics are back in The Legend of Zelda, thanks to Age of Imprisonment. It carries on the spin-offs’ focus on large-scale combat over cave exploration and puzzles, but it makes for one of the most unique Zelda games of all time.</p>







<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More Call of Duty. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-play-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is the next Call of Duty game, and it doesn’t matter how it reviews, it’s guaranteed to be under most Christmas trees for Holiday 2025. It doesn’t have to be the best game; it just has to be Call of Duty—which it is. Insider Gaming understands this, which is why you can get money off the heavy-hitter below.</p>







<h3 id="h-kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A nice surprise. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stand back, Mario Kart World, there’s a new racing game speeding onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Mario Kart World was the guaranteed winner for the Switch 2 in 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/controversial-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-has-already-been-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a> whistled through and turned out to be a pleasant competitor. It brings back a fairly niche franchise into the mainstream again.</p>







<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Samus strikes again. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> journey has been stressful, but potentially rewarding. Metroid Prime 4 was starting to slip into the void and become another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-2-still-advertising-new-job-roles-after-17-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>. It finally reappeared, and now it’s set to grace Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for the Holiday 2025 season, and it’s one of the most anticipated games—one you should probably buy if you have the console!</p>







<h3 id="h-code-vein-nbsp-2">Code Vein&nbsp;2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More pain. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Code Vein was Bandai Namco’s solo attempt to crack the Souls genre market. It didn’t quite reach the levels of a FromSoftware game, but its enchanting art style and sales were enough to captivate Bandai into giving the franchise another chance. Code Vein 2 is one of 2026’s first big games.</p>

<p>'Mounts of Mayhem' is almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> announced a new drop officially titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-minecraft-live-september-2025-new-drops-mobs-weapons-dlc-and-more">Mounts of Mayhem</a>'. The development team has now confirmed the Bedrock Edition of the game will receive this "final game drop" of the year on <strong>9th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial reveal, this new drop will come loaded with a new weapon (the spear), the Zombie Horse, and the Nautilus (a new mob you can tame, ride and equip with armour). There'll also be a Zombie Nautilus.</p>
<p>Last but not least is the Camel Husk and its two riders - a husk and a parched. The team is also adding some quality-of-life improvements such as the ability to cross bodies of water on horseback.

<p>More Mega Man action in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a> in September, mentioning at the time how this new retro package would be arriving on the Switch at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update, this new collection featuring multiple titles from the DS generation has now been rated E10+ by the ESRB – with the rating listing "Fantasy Violence" and "Users Interact". Here's the official ESRB summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection</em> is rated E10+ for Everyone 10+ by the ESRB with Fantasy Violence. Also includes Users Interact. This is a collection of action role-playing games in which players help characters battle viruses in a futuristic world. Players interact with characters, explore fantasy environments, and use battle cards to perform attacks on enemies in an arena. Battle-card attacks include use of energy blasts, punches, kicks, bombs, ice blasts, and swords. A higher-resolution art gallery depicts other violent acts: robots cut in half or impaled by swords; a character with arrows sticking out of his back."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Protodude, the owner of Mega Man fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/">Rockman Corner</a>, also notes how the "three original releases", which started out as a series in 2006/07, all carried 'E' ratings back in the day in this same location. With any luck, fans won't have to wait much longer for these games to return.</p>

<p>Once again, here are the titles and additional versions from this series included in this collection. You can find out more about what to expect from this new collection in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Leo</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One other Switch game that's recently surfaced on the ESRB is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p>

<p>The new update and patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Version 1.02, are out now for Nintendo Switch 2. With it, new quests, weapons, and fixes have been added.</p>







<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>
