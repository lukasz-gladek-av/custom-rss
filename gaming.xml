Tanks are typically expected to be defensive bullet sponges that pull aggro from their squishier teammates. But the role splits into two: some are main tank protectors, others are off-tank supporters, who run into a team fight hoping their healers are paying attention. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’</a></span> Vanguards similarly fall into several different archetypes, and each has a niche they occupy. But who is the best? While it can depend on the situation, a few heroes are more versatile than others, letting us love them more. Here’s our ranking of the eight tanks that are in the game now. We’ll update this ranking when the Thing is added later in Season 1.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-recommend-id="image://06fe36b80e40c38f15178a9f1985d839" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Captain America stands with his fists clenched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As far as Vanguards go, I consider myself a Captain America main. Because I’ve spent a decent amount of time wielding his vibranium shield I’m confident in saying that America’s Ass is easily the worst tank in the game that I keep using because I haven’t found another character I gel with. When Steve pops off, it feels incredibly satisfying—more often than not you jump into a fight, slap someone around for a little bit, then jump out as your health rapidly deteriorates. Cap is one of the most disruptive heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s hard to get that much value out of him when his melee-based kit lacks that certain punch you need to make the most of his dives. If his attacks were a little more powerful and he could reliably get kills, he could be a contender, but right now, he serves as little more than a distraction while other heroes pull off more impressive plays.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-recommend-id="image://789842a4995505044e266bc8cadb356b" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magneto stands with one hand up with his fingers curled inward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Master of Magnetism is one of the more methodical Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Sure, his slower kit isn’t as exciting as barreling through enemy teams as Thor, or setting up an ambush as Doctor Strange—hence his lower place in this list—but if you need someone to exert enormous amounts of pressure onto an enemy team and stop your team from getting dived on, Magneto’s an excellent pick. His shield-based moveset is all about absorbing damage and throwing it right back at the enemy team. He requires more patience than other tanks on the roster, but in the right hands, he’s a fortified frontline fighter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-recommend-id="image://828f71a63799b4990c400b2860530572" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Hulk stands with his right fist clenched as a green energy emits from his belt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On his face, the Hulk can come off like a gimmick character, clearly taking a page from <em>Overwatch</em>’s book. Like D.Va in Blizzard’s shooter, the Hulk has two forms, one much weaker with only a pistol to pester enemies until he can return to his massive, more impactful form. Despite this, The Hulk is an effective dive hero with good crowd control, mobility, and ways to convert damage into power, and he has better damage output than Captain America, so you can actually reliably smash your way through a team fight. His Super Hulk ultimate is an incredible survival tool that heals you to a whopping 1500 health, and altogether he’s just a really bulky brawler that can wreck shop when you know how best to cycle your abilities. However, Hulk’s team-up abilities make him one of the most desirable off tank picks with certain teammates. Pairing Hulk with Doctor Strange and Iron Man gives the two sarcastic geniuses an incredible damage boost that can make even half a team a force to be reckoned with. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-recommend-id="image://0772f58a5b065ae49cc7d235902093f8" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Venom stands with a menacing grin on his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the more entertaining spins <em>Marvel Rivals </em>puts on <em>Overwatch </em>archetypes is making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span> the equivalent of the robot-piloting hamster, Wrecking Ball. The symbiote-journalist duo is all about swinging into the battlefield, causing a bunch of chaos, and then feeding on all the incoming damage to get a second wind. He’s got great crowd control as he slows enemy movement, and can disrupt an enemy team formation better than most other heroes on the roster. Admittedly, he is one of the more independent tanks, and doesn’t have much in the way of supportive abilities to help his team, lacking something like Magneto or Hulk’s shields, but that mostly means you need a good team comp to compliment him when he swings into battle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-recommend-id="image://fed84461b43dc3ef265438dbff2bebdf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Peni lays on top of her mech as it kneels down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peni Parker is an absolute menace on defensive maps. Her mine-based kit allows her to set up traps, claim space, and has enemy teams walking on eggshells as they try to push onto an objective and avoid her explosive traps. Her abilities are less useful when you’re pushing toward an objective yourself, but her mech is powerful enough to handle scraps and push alongside more brawl-based heroes. While she may be a bit situational, Peni is easily one of the best Vanguards in the game for holding an objective and countering teams that carelessly dive on a point. Also, setting up mines in front of the enemy spawn and blowing up half their team never gets old.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-recommend-id="image://ad0ae1670a8bfcab5ec9b53064013c94" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thor holds his hammer as it radiates electricity around him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The God of Thunder is easily the best off tank in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. His mobility attacks let him dive in and out of fights easily, but they also double as a means to isolate and assassinate enemies, even as they’re grouped up. Thor’s entire kit feeds into itself, gaining power, health, and a stronger transformative state just by smartly utilizing all of his abilities. Where some tanks are more slow-paced, rewarded for intellectual play and setup, Thor is an unstoppable force, encouraged to stay in the brawl and reliably deal some of the most devastating attacks with short universal cooldowns. The catch being all of this is powered by a unique passive called Thorforce, required to pull off some of Thor’s most impressive abilities. Managing those mechanics is the difference between getting shredded immediately and swiftly taking out the enemy supports and cutting your foes off at the knees.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-recommend-id="image://2f4a95d27edab3714c79d27a6776351a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Groot stands with one hand outstretched and upward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s talking tree is one of the more straightforward Vanguards in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but Groot is also one of the most reliable at what he does. He uses his branch-like limbs to build walls anywhere on the map. This can be a defensive measure, but it’s also an excellent way to stall enemies from reaching an objective. Toss those suckers up in front of an enemy spawn door and it will take them at least a few seconds to shoot their way through. Not to mention his ultimate ability has some of the best crowd control, as he groups enemies together and sets them up for a quick and easy wipe. Groot is just good at getting in the way, and when the enemy team finally does make its way to him, he’s a strong brawler who can become near-invincible when Rocket is riding on his shoulder and pumping him full of health. Groot is the platonic ideal of a defensive tank, and I’m always thrilled to see one on my team.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-recommend-id="image://d75c7bca8d5d0871bbf4b482d857a7d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange stands with one hand turned upward at his side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stephen Strange is easily the Vanguard who has gotten the most buzz since <em>Marvel Rivals</em> was in beta, largely because his portal ability led to some hilarious viral moments of tricking foes into walking off the side of the map out of spawn. But that’s a microcosm of what makes him a compelling tank, because the experimentation he allows is unmatched by almost any other character in the roster.</p><p>Baseline, Doctor Strange is one of the most effective defensive heroes because his shield is a big Reinhardt-style wall that can protect multiple heroes at once. But after you pair that with the sorcerer’s flight-based mobility, his possibilities as a shutdown character make him an excellent counter to some of the greatest threats in the game. Is your enemy’s Hela about to unleash a devastating ultimate on your team? Fly up in her face, throw up your shield, and give your team a chance to take cover before she can rain damage down on you. Is the enemy team putting too much pressure on your team to successfully get out of spawn? Throw up a portal and ambush them from behind. And yes, a well-placed portal can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-doctor-strange-portal-combo-exploit-kills-1851723986">play incredible mind games with the enemy team</a></span>, tricking them into walking off into a chasm, or forcing them into a loop by placing both ends of the portal in front of their spawn room doors.</p><p>Doctor Strange is the kind of hero you need to keep a game like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>interesting.

Microsoft began this shift a year ago by bringing <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Pentiment</em>, and <em>Grounded</em> to other platforms, and has already confirmed its big Xbox exclusive of 2024, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will come to PS5 less than six months after release.<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>are also already confirmed to be coming day-and-date to Sony’s console in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-brandoville-outsourcing-assassins-creed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past handful of years, the video game industry has attempted to reckon with its history of workplace abuse, both in the form of crunch and managerial misconduct. Big companies will tell you they’ve been successful in their reform efforts, but the truth is that these are, at best, ongoing projects. Moreover, they’re ignoring an elephant in the room, perhaps because it’s not in the room at all: Outsourcing studios in Southeast Asia, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9HQ2C6h_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new video from People Make Games</a>, represent a hotbed of existing and potential abuse. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, People Make Games’ Chris Bratt joins us to discuss his findings.&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by digging into the particulars of PMG’s video – truly harrowing instances of abuse at an Indonesian studio called Brandoville that include a manager convincing an employee to slap herself in the face 100 times as an act of penance – and then try to figure out what allows big companies to turn a blind eye to these incidents. Why are fans and media seemingly less outraged by clear examples of misconduct at a studio that's been attached to games like <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> and <em>The Last Of Us</em> remake as long as they happen Over There? And how can people inside and outside the industry help?</p><p>Then we talk about how the wildfires currently raging in California – which have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/506288/la-fires-league-riot-games-offices-closed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">displaced</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2025-la-firestorm-palisades-games-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game studios</a>, among many, many other things – are happening right next door to CES in Las Vegas, where tech titans spent the week <a href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trumpeting the latest environmentally destructive fad</a>, generative AI. After that, we move on to slightly more lighthearted fare in our predictions for the year in gaming. Only <em>one </em>of us predicts a major industry-related crash, so that’s gotta count for something. Also, <em>Half-Life 3</em> is getting announced this year. Mark my words.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy Valve and force them to actually release <em>Half-Life 3</em>, which is a whole other can of worms.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [In 2021, when we released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts&amp;t=316s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first video on outsourcing</a>], the big conversation at that point when it came to working conditions was crunch, and you were seeing strides from certain studios to try and improve their approach to crunch – to have fewer long stints of overtime and death marches as part of game development. However, we realized that although you might see companies making those strides and claiming to have a better relationship with crunch, actually if they were outsourcing a bunch of the work on their games to these other companies in other countries, well, is the crunch still happening over there? And if so, I don’t think we can say that progress is as substantial as we might like to.</p><p>Last year, Brandoville Studios, the company in Indonesia [from our first video] shut down, and it sort of opened the floodgates on a bunch of stuff that had been happening for certain employees there. My first experience of that was when one of the people I had spoken to briefly via email in the years beforehand got in touch and said, “First of all, the emails I sent to you where I said everything was great actually, my boss told me to write that. And also, all this stuff was happening while I was there.” And she sent me, among other things, a video recording in which she’s seen slapping her own face as hard as she can 100 times in a row. We include a little bit of that in the second video we just put out where we investigate what happened. We only put in a short section with her permission.&nbsp;</p><p>But I’ve seen the whole video, and it’s just the most brutal thing to witness. It’s hard to get across unless you watch it what it feels like to watch someone hit themselves that hard that many times. Visibly, her own sense of self is not there. It’s really painful.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>It was like she wasn’t there when she was doing it – like she had gone somewhere else and was performing this action that was obviously incredibly brutal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>When you’re in an abusive workplace, you get conditioned to do things and to allow yourself to be treated in ways that you would not do otherwise. I used to stay at the office until 9 PM sometimes just because I was waiting for somebody to tell me what to do. I would go home – I was still drinking at this time – and I would crack a beer and get really afraid that my boss would call me because it would be my fault if on off-hours I was drunk and I couldn’t immediately return to work.</p><p>But the abuses here are so physical and so much worse. There’s some financial abuse that also occurred at the studio, which is really shocking, but also there’s already so many abuses occurring at the studio that you really shouldn’t be surprised.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> The recurring theme in a lot of those abuses seems to be this immense overstep into somebody’s personal boundaries – saying that I have the right to ask you to hit yourself or to personally hit you, that I have the right to control your money because you’re not good enough to control it yourself, that I have the right to talk about you in all these demeaning ways and say that you’re overweight.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> They had to send their outfits to management!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> All in all, you can tell it was a deeply disturbing story to work on. I’ve never felt so upset about a piece of reporting we’ve done. There’s so much going on there. I also felt a responsibility to do it because we had reported on this [studio] the first time around. To find out this was going on in the aftermath was just so shocking and also ties back into this issue we briefly talked about at the beginning of how outsourcing is so invisible. We all know it’s happening. Many of the products we’re using to do this stream [were outsourced].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It is a continuation of the colonial project. In the global north, we go to these countries that have fewer labor protections, and we extract the resource that we need from them, which is people willing to do work for very little money. There are emerging markets for video games. When I was at the UN recently, it was cosponsored by Japan and Morocco – Japan because it’s seen as sort of the ancestral home of video games and Morocco because they’re trying to establish their own mobile video game development industry there. That doesn’t mean original games coming out of Moroccan studios. That often means mobile games outsourcing crunch to Moroccan studios, and Morocco just trying to take ownership of that as a country.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right, because it bolsters the economy one way or another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Exactly. But it is also true that while there aren’t many labor protections in the US, there are even less in these other countries. At the end of the video, you explained that a common phrase in Indonesia when facing abuses is “No viral, no justice,” meaning that if your case does not get significant attention on the internet, it is very, very unlikely that you will ever see any kind of recompense, even in cases where they egregiously break the law by abusing you in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Something that helped me get through the reporting and I think helps viewers get through the video is that people like Christa and the other employees who eventually all come forwards – they have all of these messages, all this evidence to show what’s happened to them – they have had already a moment in Indonesia where everything did go viral. Social media went crazy with it. It was reported on by much of the mainstream news over there. The people involved – specifically the alleged abuser, Cherry [Lai] – fled the country. There’s a police investigation, and they’d like to speak to her.&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s not justice in its fullest form, but they did see that when they came forward, their country and their community and the Southeast Asian games industry did rally behind them. So there are some cathartic aspects that have already happened before we get to our video. And the reason our video exists – the motivations for them to talk to us and the motivation I have to report on it as well – is, yeah, it went viral in Indonesia and spread across parts of Southeast Asia, but most people had no idea this happened outside of that. In the global north, where the companies exist that contract studios like Brandoville–&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>–That allow for this kind of work to even exist in the first place.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Exactly. No one was talking about it. No one seemed to know about it. And so that “No viral, no justice” aspect needed to apply to the rest of the world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox"><h3>US Government Agency Proposes New Rule To Protect Victims Of Scams And Theft Involving In-Game Currency</h3></a><p>The CFPB believes some games have come to resemble banking and payment systems, and it wants them to play by the same rules</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Getting the best performance that you can out of the game on PC will take a little more legwork than getting into a lobby with your friends.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Sure, there’s an in-game option to optimize your graphics for PC players. But, this sort of just throws you into one of the presets: low, medium, high, or ultra. That can be a good place to start, but if you’re still having performance issues, it’s worth diving into the menu to see what you can change.</p><h2 id="h161070"><a id=""></a></h2><p>To find these settings, click on the gear, then settings. In the display menu, I settled on the following settings.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Display Mode: Fullscreen. Borderless Windowed works better with a multi-monitor setup, but Fullscreen is better for performance.</li><li>Anti-Aliasing and Super Resolution Type: Nvidia DLSS (for those with Nvidia cards)</li><li>Mode: Quality</li><li>Sharpening: 70-80 (This can be lowered further to try and improve performance, but it’s a small gain for a noticeable visual difference).</li><li>Frame Generation Mode: Off</li><li>Low Latency Mode: NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency</li><li><strong>V-Sync: Off</strong></li><li><strong>Global Illumination: SSGI - Low Quality</strong></li><li><strong>Reflection Quality: Screen Space Reflections</strong></li><li>Model Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Post-Processing: Low</strong></li><li>Shadow Detail: Medium</li><li>Texture Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects Detail: Low</strong></li><li>Foliage Quality: Medium</li></ul><p>This is a good base to start from if you’re running into framerate issues. If everything runs smoothly, you can try upping the non-bolded settings above for options like Texture Detail to squeeze some prettier pixels out of your GPU. But if your frame rate still isn’t where you want it to be, there are some other worthwhile options. You can try lowering settings like foliage quality, shadow detail, and reflection quality. You may also want to try lowering your game’s resolution. </p><h2 id="h161071"><a id=""></a>You can also change your reticle in <em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, you can change your reticle already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>! And, just like <em>Overwatch</em>, you can change these on a character-by-character basis. To find the menu, go to your preferred control method in the top menu (keyboard or controller), then go to combat. Here, in the HUD subsection, you’ll find the in-depth reticle editor. You choose from different types, like a simple dot or a set of crosshairs. You can create a custom color, and change the width and opacity.</p><p>As far as the best reticle, there is no 100% definitive answer. Get in this menu and experiment to see what works best for you! With this knowledge of the settings in your pocket, you’ll be better prepared than ever to help save the timeline!</p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While <em>Overwatch 2 </em>revolves around the role queue to ensure there are players on each type of hero, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have any such system in place, so you may find yourself needing to flex to play healer (Strategist) and tank (Vanguard) often. With this, learning to play a character of each type will be vital, especially if you’re solo queuing. </p><h3 id="h51129"><a id=""></a><strong>Turn off Easy Swing. You’ll thank me later. </strong></h3><p>This might seem a little counterintuitive for a beginner’s guide, but turning off this setting will help you in the long run. Though Easy Swing makes things somewhat, well, easy by way of selecting a tether point for you to swing to, turning the setting off will see Venom swing in the direction your aiming. As you get better at the game, you’ll come to rely on this greater freedom of control, even if it’s a little more challenging at first.</p><h3 id="h51130"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your melee attack frequently.</strong></h3><p>Some of the melee attacks in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>can feel a bit clunky. However, this is definitely not the case for Venom. This melee strike can add up to a three-hit combo, which does enough damage to put the finishing touch on low health Duelists are trapped in your tendrils.</p><h3 id="h51131"><a id=""></a><strong>Delay your shield</strong>. </h3><p>When diving into enemy lines, keep a very close eye on your health, and <strong>use your shield ability when your health is very low</strong>, ideally all the way down to the double digits of Venom’s sizable health bar. </p><h3 id="h51132"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch your opponent’s composition closely</strong>. </h3><p>Keeping an eye on who’s on the battlefield will determine how early you should use your shield. Watch out especially for characters that can stun, like Luna Snow. If they do manage to stun you, use your shield ability earlier, right about when your health is around 200. </p><h3 id="h51133"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your Ultimate for preservation</strong>. </h3><p>Venom’s ultimate, unlike many others in the game, does not do a whole lot of damage. It also doesn’t have a major healing effect. Instead, it grants special temporary health depending on how much damage you dish out. Mainly, Venom’s Ultimate is is good for a last ditch effort at self-preservation. </p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Five months later at a WWE x C4 event, the former WWE World Heavyweight champion revealed he was “sworn to secrecy” about any involvement in the project, likely with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307">Kevin Feige</a></span> holding with a (metaphorical) gun to his head. Questions about his involvement began to arise when he told a fan on X (formerly Twitter) that no, an individual in the <em>Captain America </em>trailer released last November <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t him</a></span>. </p><p>Now, we have definitive answers from Rollins about his work on the film. “The script went through a lot of rewrites and reshoots so what I was there to do, essentially my role got either repurposed or completely erased,” Rollins explains. “So I did do a bit of an audition to possibly pop into another role, I believe, or the repurposing of my role, I’m not exactly sure on what it was, but they ended up going in a different direction with it.”</p><p>It’s curious that a star of his caliber wouldn’t be given a straight answer on why he was removed from what may be the first blockbuster of 2025. With that said, he easily could be lying to set up a major reveal that shocks the audience. He has some experience in doing that, right? </p><p>In the end, Rollins or not, we’ll be seated and ready for Marvel’s attempt to improve upon a rather lackluster 2024 (and 2023, if we’re being honest) at the box office. Maybe a little WWE theatrics is just what they need. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A new gameplay overview video has been released by Rebellion for its upcoming survival action game Atomfall. Set after the real Windscale nuclear accident in British history, Atomfall is an alternate take on what happened after the events, with much more having gone wrong. Players are held within a quarantine zone where soldiers, bandits, and other dangers lurk.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCGyfXGPSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Atomfall gameplay video gives us a look at the world, including the village where you will spend a lot of time, plus the wilds and bunkers nearby. The start of the game will be quite Fallout-esque, in the sense you wake up and are unfamiliar with the world outside. The player character is a complete amnesiac, which gives a large amount of freedom in how you survive in this world. You could try and help everyone or be a menace to different groups. One of the groups present is the British military, who were sent in to establish the quarantine zone. However, under the rule of the military things are very strict with even the slightest indiscretion being an excuse for them to punish you.</p>
<p>The military are not the only potential threat. Outside the borders of the village, things are more dangerous. Outlaws and bandits roam this area, posing a real danger to the player. They will attack on sight, without a care of whether you could be friendly. The old quarry, the surrounding hills, and other locations all have their own secrets to discover. They also have resources that you will need to survive the world of Atomfall, The bunkers are home to irradiated creatures and patrolling security robots, both of which will attack players on sight too. But, these bunkers are key to discovering what happened so they will need to be explored.</p>
<p>Combat will be a mix of close up melee combat, with cricket bats being a weapon of choice. There are guns like pistols, shotguns, and rifles too, but as this is England ammo will not be easy to find. Using items found in the environment, weapons can be upgraded so they are more effective against foes. Crafting will be crucial to survival too, allowing players to make things such as bombs and healing items. A metal detector will be part of player’s inventory too, letting player’s search the ground for buried supply caches. Manuals will be found in the world of Atomfall too, unlocking new skills for your character like weapon throwing. The skills are grouped within four categories; ranged combat, melee combat, survival, and conditioning.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4 from March 27th, 2025.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse have released a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> update, adding a couple of maps, the ability to construct bridges, and a bevy of smaller features to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">already quite robust</a> medieval city builder. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The update rolls together two beta patches into one, gargantuan changelog. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-is-getting-new-maps-building-upgrades-and-reworks-for-the-marketplace-and-ale-distribution">Teased last November</a>, the new maps are High Peaks and Winding River. The latter is obviously where the bridge-building mechanic - an extension of the existing road tool - gets its chance to shine. 
</p>
<p>
Bridge-building is, I imagine, also helped along by some tweaks to the game's cliff geography. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253?l=english">Posting on Steam</a>, lead developer Greg Styczeń writes that it should be clearer which areas are buildable or traversable, thanks to a zigzag pattern that appears during build mode. He's also tweaked the pathfinding around cliffs, and got rid of a problem where gaps would appear between landscape components and cliffs when you zoom out.
</p>
<p>
Other major changes include worker restrictions for stalls. As of this patching, only storage building workers can set up marketplace stalls, because "there was too much confusion about who owned what and works where, and it was very difficult for players to understand, for instance, that a gravedigger could have a food stall," the developer goes on. Sorry gravediggers, but you'll have to flog your homegrown produce by other means. The number of goods a marketplace can supply is also now capped by the number of stalls (and therefore, assigned storage buildings), with capacity indicated on the market panel.
</p>
<p>
Styczeń has also introduced a stone well upgrade for wells, along with level two taverns, while changing how ale and water are distributed from wells and taverns. 
</p>
<p>
This is but the tip of the update's acrid compost heap. By all means click that Steam link and fill your horrified eyes with bulletpoints. Sometimes when I read an overly long changelog, I can feel myself... <em>changelogging in turn</em>. My brain starts to feel like a village marketplace, crowded with boisterous oxen and sorrowful gravediggers, hopelessly offering handfuls of turnips to anybody who will take them.
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> launched in April last year, and was due to remain in early access for approximately one year. Using such braincells as I have left that aren't now wholly given over to talk of bowyers, burgage plots and butchery, I deduce from this that it might leave early access in April 2025.

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be getting a major boost in games after it launches. According to a new claim from known leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, Xbox exclusives Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection are coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The games are also reported to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.</p>







<p>“Games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025, beyond the obvious, include Flight Simulator—will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2—and Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” NateTheHate said.</p>



<p>While those two games were the main ones discussed, they don’t appear to be the only ones coming to the upcoming Nintendo console. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> about games coming to the system, Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden said the total would be “way more than that”. He then followed up with that the games would be “most older games/timed stuff”.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct Announced for January 23&nbsp;</a></h6>



<p>No other details about what older games could come to the system were mentioned. Aside from Xbox games, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth—both PlayStation 5 console exclusives—will come to the system. They’ll also be coming to Xbox starting with Remake in 2025 and Rebirth in 2026.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo Switch 2 getting major Xbox first-party games like Flight Simulator and Halo?

The writers planned for Jensen to take out one member of the Illuminati rather than the Illuminati itself, which would have caused “Bob Page to become Bob Page.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bob Page is the antagonist of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex">the original Deus Ex game</a>, Ion Storm’s hugely influential 2000 cyberpunk adventure. So, in this way, Jensen’s fate is to <em>cause</em> Deux Ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He can never catch up to the Illuminati,” Cecere explained. “We know this. We know the Illuminati keep going until 2050. We know some of those same characters that are in the Illuminati inner circle are in 2050. So Jensen can never get there and do something concrete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, what can happen? That was the question we were trying to answer at some point. So we did have one name that we could get rid of, and that was the one that Jensen would have caught up to and done something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The repercussions were that by Jensen doing this, it causes Deus Ex, if that makes sense. And that’s the tragedy of Jensen, is that he causes what happens after — by doing something — he causes Bob Page to become Bob Page. That was where we were heading.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely we’ll ever get to see this version of events. After the release of Mankind Divided in 2016, previous owner Square Enix had Eidos-Montréal shift to other projects, including 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Then, in 2022, Square Enix sold Eidos-Montréal and the Deus Ex franchise to controversial umbrella company Embracer.

Between the team making their Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-revealed-as-full-title-along-with-first-footage-confirmation-its-set-in-the-60s-sdcc-2024"><u>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</u></a> this July, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doctor-doom-becomes-emperor-of-the-marvel-universe-in-2025-nycc-2024"><u>One World Under Doom</u></a> event shaking up the mainline comic universe as Ryan North continues his acclaimed run on the property, and NetEase’s hero shooter Marvel Rivals making the F4 the focus of Eternal Night Falls (the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>post-launch season</u></a>), 2025 is shaping up to be the year that Marvel’s First Family reclaims their position as one of the Marvel universe’s core pillars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet the fact that they were ever <em>not </em>is a crime in itself. The 2010s saw the Fantastic Four lose a lot of their luster between their comic series being cancelled from 2015 to 2018, Josh Trank’s 2015 reboot becoming one of the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fantastic_four_2015" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>worst-received comic book movies</u></a> of all time, and supporting cast members being removed from cartoons and video games, such as Doctor Doom not appearing in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite despite being a series mainstay. That’s all set to change in 2025, with all the new media featuring the Fantastic Four being a much-needed correction. Let’s take a look at how we got here and why 2025 is the year of the Fantastic Four.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The 2010s: Less Than Fantastic</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2010s were a pivotal decade for Marvel’s ascension to the top of the pop culture pyramid because of the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers were one of Marvel’s longest-running brands going as far back as 1963, but they weren’t household names in the same way Spider-Man or the X-Men were until Marvel Studios turned the likes of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor into superstars. Now, we’re happy that those long-standing Marvel heroes are as beloved by the general public today as they are by us nerds. But the rise of the MCU also had a dark side in how it dealt with the franchises Marvel Studios didn’t have access to on the movies side, where competitors they needed to outshine controlled certain characters. In particular, we're talking about the Fantastic Four and X-Men licenses once held by 20th Century Fox.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Fantastic Four suffered the indignity of having their comic cancelled over the 20th Century Fox situation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the height of MCU mania in the mid-2010s, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davegonzales/2015/05/31/marvel-is-killing-x-men-and-fantastic-four-merchandising/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Marvel moved away</u></a> from Fantastic Four and X-Men merchandise in favor of boosting properties they’d produced or were developing into films. That would be one thing, but the Fantastic Four also suffered the indignity of having their comic cancelled over the situation. Longtime Marvel writer Jonathan Hickman, who wrote the Fantastic Four book from 2009 to 2012 and is currently working on Ultimate Spider-Man, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/fantastic-four-writer-jonathan-hickman-says-marvel-canceled-comic-due-to-fox-dispute"><u>confirmed</u></a> that Marvel stopped publishing Fantastic Four “because of their disagreement with Fox.” That Marvel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/20/fantastic-fours-return-was-definitely-worth-the-wait"><u>resumed publishing</u></a> the main F4 book when Disney was in the process of purchasing 20th Century Fox is most likely not a coincidence. Not to valorize corporate consolidation, but Disney reacquiring the Fantastic Four film license seems to have opened the gates for the characters to make their return to prominence in both comics and adaptations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s important to remember that despite no longer being at the height of their popularity, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-essential-issues-of-marvel-1961-1963"><u>wouldn’t have</u></a> a Marvel universe without the Fantastic Four. Their debut in 1961 was the genesis from which Stan Lee and Jack Kirby launched nearly all of the Marvel characters we’ve come to know and love in the time since, and their book featured the first appearances of many Marvel icons such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-doctor-doom-was-the-only-choice-for-the-mcus-new-thanos"><u>Doctor Doom</u></a>, Silver Surfer, Galactus, the Watcher, Black Panther, Adam Warlock, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/agatha-all-along"><u>Agatha Harkness</u></a>, the Skrulls, the Kree, the Inhumans and more. That pedigree alone should permanently guarantee them a spot in Marvel’s main pantheon, but you’d be hard-pressed to find any media about the Fantastic Four beyond their own comic from the past decade or so. Luckily, we now know things are about to turn around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2025: The Return of the Fantastic Four</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s crazy to realize that the Fantastic Four will finally join the MCU a mere 17 years (!) after it began, but better late than never, we suppose. The Fantastic Four: First Steps is the second reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise (third if you count the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/17/doomed-the-untold-story-of-roger-cormans-the-fantastic-four-review"><u>unreleased 1994 film</u></a>), and will bring the F4 back to the big screen. The excitement for First Steps is a far cry from where we were 10 years ago, when Fox’s last attempt at an F4 film left fans worried that we’d never see the First Family in live-action ever again. It’s hard to overstate just how doomed (ha) the Fantastic Four felt when Fant4stic (as the title was stylized) bombed in theaters back in 2015. But now that they’re back in Marvel’s hands, we know that we’re not just getting a new take on the Fantastic Four, but that they’re also set to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-fantastic-four-need-to-be-at-the-center-of-avengers-doomsday-and-secret-wars"><u>major players</u></a> in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, where the team will confront Robert Downey, Jr’s Doctor Doom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just the movies. Ryan North has been penning the main Fantastic Four comic for the past couple of years, and will also be writing Marvel’s big 2025 crossover event One World Under Doom. This series will feature the Avengers and Fantastic Four dealing with a world where Doctor Doom has not just taken up the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme, but is also the self-declared Emperor of Earth. It’s not the first time Doom has conquered the planet (see David Michelinie and Bob Hall’s Marvel Graphic Novel #27: Emperor Doom from 1987 and Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribić’s 2015 Secret Wars for his previous successes), but placing the Fantastic Four’s greatest nemesis at the center of their publishing year is surely a calculated effort on Marvel’s part to push the Fantastic Four franchise into the limelight as they prepare to make Doom their new Thanos for the Multiverse Saga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And most pressingly, the Fantastic Four are set to join Marvel Rivals as the first batch of post-launch playable characters in Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, where the F4 and the rest of the hero roster must confront Dracula and his legions in New York City. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvel-rivals-official-mister-fantastic-character-reveal-trailer"><u>Mr. Fantastic</u></a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvel-rivals-official-invisible-woman-character-reveal-trailer"><u>Invisible Woman</u></a> will join the battlefield on January 10 as the game’s newest Duelist and Strategist respectively, with the Thing and the Human Torch making their debut later in the season. The team’s robot companion HERBIE will also appear as a map item, with heroes needing to escort the little guy through the vampire-infested NYC. Making the Fantastic Four the focus of the first full chapter of Rivals’ overarching narrative shows how important they should be to every version of the Marvel universe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Most Anticipated Comics of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It took some time, but with the Fantastic Four now back in movies, comics and games, hopefully we never again have to go through an extended period without Marvel’s First Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we round up the current deluge of leaks surrounding Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">Nintendo has now acknowledged</a> the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">dummy Switch 2 models are being publicly shown off</a> by accessories manufacturers, and while these may not be based on access to the actual system, there's little doubt now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">we've seen the gist</a>. (Even Nintendo is saying the leaks are "not official" rather than simply inaccurate.) A full reveal now feels  imminent.</p>
<p>Also this week, we discuss the increasingly troubled Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft, which has just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">delayed the series' next entry for a second time</a> while it issues cryptic messages suggesting the company is about to be taken private, sold, or something else just as monumental. What is going on - and how has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> become the most pivotal game in Ubisoft's history? Joining me this week to discuss are Ed Nightinale, Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>

            <p>If it seems like only last week that I was complaining there were too many gigantic space games, that's because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spacecraft-is-aiming-for-the-gap-between-starfield-satisfactory-and-eve-online">it was only last week</a>. Since then, I have written about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> 2, because I am nothing if not a creature of contradictions. Now, here I am writing about Era One. In my defence, it's all your fault. Specifically, it's TheGreatOneSea's fault. They left a comment about Era One on our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most-anticipated 2025 games</a>, and reader, I Googled.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It turns out that Era One is Homeworld, but you can clip together your own fleets like LEGO models. "It's Homeworld, but" is a formulation that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">unfailingly gets my hyperdrive humming</a>, and in this case, the developers are the modding team behind celebrated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-2">Homeworld 2</a> mod the Complex. They also helped Gearbox with Homeworld Remastered. Yes, I still have space in my life for this space sim. But it's the last one, you hear? None of you better recommend anything else in the comments. I'm serious. I will cry.</p>

<p>What excites me about Era One is actually the sound design. There's a particular grade of radio chatter I associate with Homeworld, a special blend of tinniness and white noise that makes even the most routine NPC dialogue sound a little sinister, a little inhuman. Era One very much has that. It also has, oh, so many ship modules. Here's some blurb to wash down that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Era One is an innovative space-themed game that empowers players to build their own fleet from scratch. Starting with a primary core ship or base, you'll have the freedom to construct a diverse range of capital ships, stations, floating bases, and even cities. This is made possible through the assembly of modules (referred to as cubes or bricks) that, when combined in a 3D space, give shape and function to your ship or base. </p>
<p>"Various types of modules will be available, each serving a specific purpose. For instance, basic modules will focus on structural integrity and customization, offering numerous variants that may expand in the future. Dedicated modules will handle resource loading, unloading, storage, and energy production. Hangar modules will enable the creation of fighters, cruisers, battleships, while other modules will manage your population, offensive and defensive weaponry, and subsystems." </p></blockquote>
<p>The developers classify Era One as "a spaceship builder and survival game set in an RTS environment". If you're fretting that it all sounds too sandboxy, there's a story component as well, though it's not clear from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2509200/ERA_ONE/">the Steam page</a> how elaborate the campaign options will be. </p>

<p>"From the ashes of a shattered universe, a young woman's quest for salvation sparks a journey of intrigue, danger, and discovery," explains the blurb. The short version is that Earth's resources have been depleted, and humans are now scattered across the solar system, warring over scraps. Genetic modification is rife, political upheaval abounds, and many people now live in space cities called "Navi Mondo". Somebody called Alya De Shars has stolen a power source and is embarked on a secret mission to find "a fresh beginning beyond the solar system". Honestly, I find the worldbuilding a bit of an undecided stew, but the premise of a fateful voyage is very Homeworldy.</p>
<p>Era One launches on 20th February. If you'd rather not build your own ships, and you like hiding behind planets, you might prefer to keep an eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280190/Falling_Frontier/">Falling Frontier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
