            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-seemingly-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>PC port could be on the way very soon, if now-deleted text spotted in a PlayStation Store listing for the game is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The text seems to have been added to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4 store page</a> for&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption</em>&nbsp;(that's the first game, not <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2">the sequel</a>), and although it's since been removed, you can see the listing <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823224534159196470" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here courtesy of Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<p>The listing invites players to experience&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>"now on PC for the first time ever", and while much of it is identical to the listing as it currently stands, the deleted text also contains a few PC-specific extras you can seemingly expect from the imminent PC port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-rumor.jpg?itok=TNii1E3z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-rumor.jpg?itok=uaprPTrG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>be on its way to PC soon?</figcaption></figure><p>If the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>is indeed on the way, it looks like it'll have everything you'd expect from a modern PC port.</p>
<p>This includes "support for increased resolutions and framerates", as well as multi-monitor support, "spatial surround sound", and more. The PC version will also seemingly boast all of the 2023 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch-port">console version upgrades</a>.</p>
<p>It would make perfect sense for Rockstar to release&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>on PC, especially after the game was released on PS4 (although not PS5 or Xbox consoles, strangely) and Nintendo Switch last year.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>is available on PC and has been for quite some time, so it's a little odd that PC gamers can't enjoy John Marston's story in the same way they can experience Arthur Morgan's tale.</p>

<p><em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 all the way back in 2010. It tells the story of John Marston, a former outlaw whose family is kidnapped by a governmental organization that wants Marston to do its dirty work.</p>
<p>The game is available right now on PlayStation 4 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/red-dead-redemption-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it looks like it'll be coming to PC sometime soon as well. Sorry, Xbox owners; looks like you're still out of luck. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34487406&amp;company=keywords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Keywords Studios announced that it acquired Wushu Studios, a Liverpool-based game developer. </p>



<p>Keywords Studios CEO Bertrand Bodson said that the acquisition will “build out our game development offer globally.” </p>



<p>Bodson specifically mentions Wushu’s “skilled team” and “strong relationships” as advantages. They believe the Wushu Studios acquisition will “complement our existing Create studios.”</p>



<p>Wushu Studios founder Alan McDermott stated the Wushu team will “maintain our creative independence” while expanding its resources. There are plans to grow and take on “ever more ambitious projects” in the future. It will also “remain faithful to our people-first approach to development.”</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/wushustudios/status/1823313683516125595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Wushu Studios also praised the “shared values” and “passion for development” at Keywords Studios.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Keywords Studios offers a wide range of services, including everything from game development and localization to marketing services.</p>



<p>Wushu Studios is a longtime support studio that worked on a variety of popular projects. Some of the previous titles Wushu worked on include Fall Guys, State of Decay 2, The Ascent, Forza Horizon 5, and even the hit RPG Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>



<p>Fall Guys <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently joined Fortnite</a> with a limited-time mode and the opportunity for Fortnite Creators to publish new Fall Guys islands. Baldur’s Gate 3 fans recently enjoyed a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-launched-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch 7 closed beta</a>, which released on Steam in late July.</p>

While it might not be the most extravagant preorder bonus ever offered for a Nintendo game, it's still a nice addition and could become a sought-after collector's item in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/13/zelda-acrylic-diorama-included-at-best-buy-with-echoes-of-wisdom-preorders-2-1723548073155.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Acrylic Diorama</figcaption></figure></output><p>Given that all major retailers are offering Echoes of Wisdom at the same price ($59.99), you’re not missing out on anything by choosing Best Buy, especially with the bonus on the table. If you're planning to preorder, it makes sense to go with the retailer that offers a little something extra.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> marks a significant milestone as the first mainline Zelda game to feature <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">Princess Zelda as the protagonist</a>, a long-awaited development that fans have been eager to see for decades. Nintendo has finally answered this call, and the result is nothing short of thrilling. The game adopts a visually striking art style reminiscent of the almost claymation-like aesthetic seen in the Link's Awakening remake, which suits the world of Hyrule beautifully.</p><div id="202464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3></p><div><p>Preoders include a free acrylic stand.</p></div></div><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-new-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer">story begins with mysterious purple rifts tearing open across Hyrule</a>, pulling people into the unknown. While Link is among those trapped, Zelda manages to escape, leaving her to shoulder the burden of saving the kingdom herself. Though the exact reasoning behind the kingdom’s military being unable to assist her is a bit unclear, the premise sets the stage for an exciting adventure led by Zelda.</p><p>A key gameplay mechanic is the innovative use of "echoes." Armed with the Tri Wand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-gets-deep-dive-in-traversing-hyrule-trailer">Zelda can summon echoes—items and enemies she has previously encountered</a>. These echoes play a crucial role in combat, puzzle-solving, and reaching new areas. This mechanic promises to challenge players' creativity, much like the inventive gameplay seen in Tears of the Kingdom. It's exciting to see such engaging and inventive puzzle-solving brought into a 2D-style Zelda game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In other Zelda news.

As Onnée explained, the four years of development was ideal for building the game, receiving feedback, and focusing on areas that needed work.</p><p>"We always want to go better, which is what we're trying to do with Shadows. We are pushing the limits of what we can do," Onnée said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/four-years-offers-the-right-balance-to-make-a-new-assassins-creed-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesindustry.Biz</a>. "It's always a balance between time and costs, but the more time you have, the more you can iterate. Yes, you can put more people on a project and do it in a shorter time, but that doesn't give you more time to iterate, because it takes time to get the feedback from your players, your team, and then see what works and what doesn't and how to improve it. Four years, I think, is the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt."</p>

<p>The previous mainline entry in the series, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, launched back in November 2020. Ubisoft did fill out the last couple of years with substantial expansions for Valhalla--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-dlc-review/1900-6417674/" data-ref-id="1900-6417674">Wrath of the Druids</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-review-having-a-good-time/1900-6417841/" data-ref-id="1900-6417841">Dawn of Ragnarok</a>--and smaller spin-off games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 12, and will see the series explore 16th-century Japan through two protagonists.

Composing the music for this game, I wanted my compositions to contribute to the immersion of the game world – and that included the freezing cold of this particular mission.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I thought, what sound effects are intrinsically wintery? Wind isn’t limited to winter, and snowfall is pretty silent. So that leaves the sounds people make in the snow. I wanted something that would work inside a stealthy rhythmic musical texture during exploration, so I thought about skiing. What does it sound like when a ski slides across the snow?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[video]</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seemed like a start, but it wasn’t particularly useful from a rhythmic perspective.

I’ve had lots of opportunities to add creature vocalizations into my musical scores, and there are tons of ways to make that work. So let’s take a look at a few examples, starting with the simplest way to use animal sounds to make a point.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Diegetics in the animal kingdom">Diegetics in the animal kingdom</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the Speed Racer video game developed by Sidhe Interactive, you’re an elite driver trying to reach the top of the winner’s podium in the World Racing League Cup, which includes numerous events at exotic locales.

However, the objective of having properly balanced parameters in a game is crucial to make it engaging, with diverse gameplay and -- ultimately -- successful. Not to mention that properly balanced online multiplayer games have the potential to be played in competitive or even e-sport settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine a battle encounter in an RPG game, in which you want experienced players to win by a narrow margin. This can be a design goal to create suspense as the outcome remains uncertain until the very end. As the previous one, this task also requires finding the correct set of parameters from a vast, multi-dimensional space of possible values.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In both examples, properly used evolutionary algorithms can support you. More examples of use cases will be provided in the “Designing a Good Fitness Function“ section of this article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have conducted a very simple proof of concept. Earlier, before even applying evolutionary algorithms, we had developed a simple demo called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grailbots</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which demonstrates one of the techniques offered by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grail</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp; In short, Grail (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://grail.com.pl/">https://grail.com.pl/</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) is a middleware designed to implement AI in games using C++ or C#. It is suitable for various engines including custom ones, Unity, or Unreal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grailbots showcases the Utility AI technique implemented in Grail. This demo features two teams controlled by AI:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grailbots </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- a team of four “smarter” soldiers whose behavior is implemented using Utility AI.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They resemble agents that could also be controlled by humans in a real-game.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Enemies </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- these appear in three waves and represent simple mobs with straightforward assault behavior, taking the shortest path to the Grailbots.

In this situation, one Grailbot has already been killed by the Enemies.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For this proof-of-concept, our aim was to select the set of parameters of Grailbots and Enemies, such that the Grailbots would typically win by the smallest possible margin. Ideally, the best outcome would be having just one Grailbot surviving with 1 HP after the three enemy waves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This objective may sound artificial, but our idea was to test whether a design goal of this complexity could be feasibly achieved automatically using evolutionary algorithms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the following sections, we will continue to explore this use case but first let us provide a short background on this area. The Grailbots example will be continued in the final section.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Brief Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms">Brief Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Evolutionary algorithms (EA) draw inspirations from nature. In particular, the fundamental concepts that underpin their idea are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>natural selection</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>adaptation </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to the environment and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>survival of the fittest</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. These concepts were introduced in 1859 by Charles Darwin in a book titled “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The classic way of solving problems on computers involves writing sequences of specific instructions. This significantly differs from evolutionary algorithms, which are an example of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, albeit not as popular in recent years as Machine Learning. In EAs, as well as in broader AI, programmers only specify some measure of the quality for the end result without explicitly programming the way to achieve it. The solution is found automatically using a general, problem-agnostic approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They also belong to subclasses of AI called:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Computational Intelligence</span></span></p></div></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In EAs, a population of potential solutions to a problem is maintained. The initial population contains weak solutions, often generated randomly or using a simple heuristic. These potential solutions are then subjected to a process mimicking natural evolution. They can reproduce and mutate. The new offspring replace some or all of the previous generation, forming a new population. There is also a concept of fitness, which plays a key role in selection of the individuals for the new population. Some of the basic notions you should know are presented in the next section.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>evolutionary computation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> encompasses several techniques inspired by natural evolution. For example:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Evolutionary algorithms: the topic of this article</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Genetic algorithms (GA): similar to EAs, but they assume a binary-string encoding</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Evolutionary strategies: iterative search method, which is often based on evolving a single solution</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Genetic programming: evolving computer programs; they use dedicated representations</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Memetic algorithms: also referred to as cultural algorithms, they combine GAs or EAs with local search</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Differential evolution: a R^n -&gt; R function optimization technique, which uses specific methods of combining existing solutions.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Basic Terminology">Basic Terminology</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individual</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - represents a single complete candidate solution to a problem that is solved using evolutionary computation. Individuals form a population and undergo evolutionary operations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Genotype (chromosome)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - represents the genetic encoding of the parameters of the individual. This is the representation used for evolutionary operations. For example, in genetic algorithms, a binary string is a commonly used encoding. One of the benefits of such an encoding is the ability to use the standard, well-established genetic operators with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gene </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- a fundamental unit and building block of a genotype. Genes are typically located at fixed positions within a chromosome like cells in a vector.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phenotype</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - this is the decoded representation, which is the actual form in which the solution is used in the real world. This representation is also referred to as “expressed” or “observable”. It contains features that are observable consequences of a particular genotype. Using the analogy to nature, while the genotype can be likened to a DNA sequence, the phenotype is the actual living organism that possesses this DNA sequence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Population</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - a collection of individuals that together undergoes the evolutionary process. Individuals within the population compete with each other and may recombine. In other words, a population represents all potential solutions maintained at a given moment in the algorithm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fitness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - assigned to individuals, is the numerical assessment of the quality of the candidate solution represented by the individual. Fitness is calculated by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fitness function</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and is typically defined as a floating-point number.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossover (recombination)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - an operation that combines genetic information from two (or more in rare cases) parent individuals to create one or more offspring, analogous to biological reproduction. Many common crossover operations have been proposed. Most of them combine parts of the parents' encodings in some way with stochastic elements such as choosing the crossover point at random. Typically, fitter individuals (with higher fitness) have a higher chance of being selected for reproduction. Thus, crossover is often associated with exploitation, as it aims to exploit parts of the most promising candidate solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mutation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - another genetic operation that introduces small random changes to individuals. Unlike crossover, mutation requires only one parent, subsequently mutates. Also, unlike crossover, mutation is typically applied with a very small probability (e.g., 0.05 - 0.1) to each individual. Mutation is often associated with exploration as random alterations to the encoding enable exploration of unknown regions in the solution space.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Children (offspring)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - new individuals created through the application of genetic operations (crossover and mutation) to parent individuals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Selection</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - the procedure of choosing individuals from the current population, including the results of mutation and recombination, for the next population. The next population will serve as parents in the next iteration. There are many selection methods, but most of them select individuals with higher fitness with higher probability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elitism</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - a mechanism that allows the best-evaluated individuals from the current (parent) generation to survive into the next generation without any change. Such individuals are called the elite ones. This mechanism ensures that the best solutions are not lost due to randomness introduced by the evolutionary operations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Epoch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - one iteration of the evolutionary algorithm.

This requires thinking about the desired outcomes in numeric terms. The value of the fitness function indicates the extent to which your design goals have been achieved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fitness function can be categorized as:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deterministic </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- where a given phenotype consistently receives the same fitness score. For example, consider the problem of finding the shortest path in a graph with the fitness function defined as the inverse of the total distance. The same paths have the same total distance and thus the consistently the same fitness value.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Non-deterministic </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- where different evaluations might assign varying fitness scores to the same individual due to random elements in the calculation procedure.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, the fitness function can be:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Direct (absolute) </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- if it assesses an individual directly based on its attributes and returns its quality without requiring the comparison with other individuals. An example is the inverse of total distance in the shortest path problem, where the fitness directly depends on the path.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Relative </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">- where fitness results from interactions between two or more individuals in the population. For instance, consider a tournament setup for each individual in a population, where each participant competes in five 1-on-1 matches against randomly selected opponents. The fitness value is then derived from the number of wins divided by five. This is an example of both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>relative </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>non-deterministic </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">fitness function.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>deterministic </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&amp; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>absolute</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fitness functions are the best in terms of speed and convergence of evolutionary algorithms. However, in game development, you will typically be dealing with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>non-deterministic </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&amp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> relative</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Below, I am showing boxes presenting some examples and inspirations for your games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first row of each box specifies the type of game and the optimization objective within it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second row describes the idea for the evaluation function.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reliance of Human Players in Fitness Computations">Reliance of Human Players in Fitness Computations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, this evaluation procedure may involve human players but this makes both the implementation non-standard and the process to take extensively long.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would be best if you could define an evaluation function that only requires to run bots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if you can’t?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if you really need to evaluate your game against humans?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In such a case I would recommend defining the fitness value of a given individual (representing a given set of parameters) as an average value of outcomes from games played by humans against this particular individual. By doing it this way, we can compare results against a hopefully normal distribution of players and the more human players will play, the more confident the fitness value will be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let us estimate the effort.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of evaluations needed depends on the number of children produced in each iteration and the number of iterations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The population size should depend on the problem complexity, but I recommend having a number </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>between 60 and 300</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, because these are the sizes tested the most in various problems in the literature. For the number of iterations, I recommend from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>40 to 200</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s make a modest assumption of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 iterations and 60 children</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> produced per iteration. This requires </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4800 evaluations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where each evaluation will be typically a game against a human player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s assume that one game episode lasts for 30 minutes making the whole workload equal to 2400 man-hours. Assuming an 8-hour work day, it totals to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>300 mandays.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is expensive but doable given enough number of participants and a parallelized setup.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, bear in mind that we have made low-end assumptions about the population size and the number of iterations. I really recommend setting the process using exclusively bots.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making your Game Simulable">Making your Game Simulable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After reading the previous section, it is clear by now that most fitness evaluation functions for our purposes will require the ability to perform a vast number of simulations of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To provide this ability, make sure that:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You are able to perform many simulations that start from a given initial situation.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You either need to implement a robust state loading system or perform a hard reset, but pass the information about the current individual(s) to evaluate. In the latter case, your evolutionary algorithm object must persist between the restarts, or be written and read from the disk or executed on an external server that communicates with the machine that performs the simulations.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You are able to dynamically apply all the parameters encoded in the individual to the game.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You make the simulations as short as possible. This includes defining scenarios (episodes) within the game and optimizations discussed below.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Headless simulations: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">if the simulation only involves bots, consider creating a headless version of the game, i.e., one without graphical rendering. This should be done unless graphics are essential for the proper functioning of the game. Excluding human players eliminates the need for graphics, which can significantly speed up the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Speed up time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: try increasing the internal clock of the game to make it run faster. Again, this is only feasible in simulations without human players. However, do it carefully, as sometimes, increasing the rate at which the game is played may interfere with the physics calculations. Also, this acceleration is constrained if the bots in the game require a minimum amount of time to “think”. In practice, it is typically possible to increase the speed by at least a factor of 2-3.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Save and load of the EA state</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: implementing the functionality to fully serialize the current state of a running EA algorithm, including the current population, enables the process to be split across multiple sessions. This is particularly useful in scenarios, where computing resources are not always fully available or when human players are involved in the loop. For example, if human players are required to play the game, some machines can be allocated for this purpose. Whenever a player is ready to play, the system will load the current state of the EA. The player may then advance the progress of the algorithm by some steps, depending on the number of games played.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Parallelization: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">while not required, it will make the process significantly faster. EA algorithms are very convenient to parallelize and they can benefit a lot from this optimization. Parallel computing can be implemented either on a single machine (taking advantage of CPU threads) or many machines.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">There are a lot of strategies for parallelizing the EAs. The most common ones are:</span></p></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Parallelization of evaluating individuals:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while the main thread handles a single population and oversees the execution of the EA (Evolutionary Algorithm) at a high level, worker machines can be assigned to assess given individuals or just specified subsets of the population. For instance, if there are four remote machines available, each can evaluate one-fourth of the population.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Parallel populations:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> another strategy involves running semi-independent EA processes, each with its own distinct population. After several epochs, these populations can undergo merging, synchronization, or interchange of individuals among them. This method is often known as the “island model”. It allows for a diversified genetic pool across different populations.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Our Implementation in Grailbots">Our Implementation in Grailbots</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The following seven parameters have been chosen for optimization:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Health value of each Grailbot</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of random enemies in the first wave</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of random enemies in the second wave</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of random enemies in the third wave</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The probability that a random enemy in the first wave will be a rifleman (vs. melee soldier)</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The probability that a random enemy in the second wave will be a rifleman (vs. melee soldier)</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The probability that a random enemy in the third wave will be a rifleman (vs. melee soldier)</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This can be set up using the Grail library by inheriting from a class named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individual</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as shown in Listing 1.

He's the creator of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Glow Golf</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a minimalist, approachable, sports game that asks players to complete randomly generated golf courses (laid out along an LED strip) using a bespoke controller. The title is being tested in care homes and special needs centres to explore how video games can become more accessible by defying convention.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="New audiences require new ideas">New audiences require new ideas</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Untangling how to create experiences for new audiences that don't fit the narrow definition of 'gamer' is something Johansson has been grappling with for some time. "A real through line of my career has been engaging with new people in public spaces, and the thing that has really stuck with me is giving people their first experiences in games," he says. "There's nothing else that comes close. I love it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johansson recently decided that 'gamers' will no longer be his primary audience moving forward. They're more than welcome to enjoy his work, but he's "given them 10 years, and that's enough."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, why pursue new audiences? There are two key points: expectations are far lower than in this bloody industry. We're currently choking to death–and we have to drop the standards. An easy way to do that is to disregard this [more conventional] audience and consider new ones. The other half of it, which I care far more about, is you can really challenge what you consider to be intuitive," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johansson suggests unshackling from convention means ditching interfaces and controllers that have become "inherently hostile." For instance, he suggests most controllers and gamepads are stagnant and oppressive, preventing those who aren't familiar with those widespread inputs from entering the digital playground. To change the narrative, he feels designers should be actively conversing with new audiences to understand what interfaces work for them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Drilling that point home, Johansson shows an image of a racing game he designed with an elderly woman who'd never played a video game before. After workshopping control schemes together, they landed on the idea of dragging a coin between two contact points–a movement reminiscent of how you'd remove the foil from a scratch card. It might seem like an offbeat pitch, but Johansson says it worked because the interface "resonates" with her.</span></p><p>Glow Golf incorporates a bespoke 'putter' controller</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real lightbulb moment for me was the idea that if you can surface those inputs from those audiences, you can potentially build inputs that resonate with that demographic. Then you've just unlocked how that population can engage with games," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As part of that, [you might ask the question] why should we consider the elderly? This is something I deeply care about. As an industry, we've generally disregarded the elderly–either ignored them or demonised them–in our pursuit for engaging the young. That's just not the case anymore. Game developers are dying of old age. In 20 years people that grew up with arcades will be in their 80s or 90s–or dead. So we have to engage these audiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Challenging any doubters, Johansson says an elderly couple aged 96 and 85 won a Wii Bowling tournament in France just last year (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elderly-couple-wins-at-wii-bowling-tournament-in-wholesome-gaming-moment">thanks Eurogamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). For him, it's a fact that shows the industry needs to start committing to creating experiences that cater to marginalised, overlooked, and underserved audiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He accepts it's a pivot that won't guarantee success, but with the industry in dire straits, why not take a punt? "I've been making games for 10 years and it's just about sustainable at this point for me–with help. But the truth is, games right now–as I'm sure a lot of you appreciate–is barely commercially sustainable. If that's the case you might as well take a chance on someone new," he continues</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of where to start: both with alternative controller [games] and with approaching design is to keep the scope really small. More than anything else, just ditch the keyboard. Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad are just outdated inputs. If you can do it at an exhibition, that's a perfect format for it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Johansson says the most critical question designers should be asking themselves is this: "how can you reach one new person who's never experienced games before?" If you can figure that out, there's a good chance you're on the right path.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">Click here for more AMAZE Sheffield coverage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-get-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-as-well-as-ports-of-previous-entries-in-the-series-%E2%80%93-rumor.951702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-ports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is supposedly coming to Nintendo Switch 2 alongside ports of previous entries in the series, like Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p>
<p>According to a new rumor from <a href="https://x.com/NWeedle/status/1823324197638058092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nash Weedle</a>, all the most recent main entries in the series, as well as last year's Assassin's Creed Mirage, are going to get ported to Nintendo Switch 2. The latest entry in the series will supposedly be ready for the console's launch window of around six months or so, while the others will be released progressively over time. The Odyssey and Origins ports will be bundled together, which makes sense, considering they are rather old games at this point. These ports will also only be the beginning, as Ubisoft will reportedly bet heavily on the new console.</p>
<p>Necro Felipe, Editor in chief of Universo Nintendo, who proved to be reliable in regards to Nintendo leaks, did not corroborate the entire leak but did <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1823093613275787524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back up the Assassin's Creed Shadows port</a>, so it is likely owners of the Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to play the latest entry in the series on the system within six months of launch. No matter how reliable these leakers could be, take all this with a grain of salt until official confirmation of these ports.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, but rumors indicated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/">console shouldn't be too far off in terms of performance from the Steam Deck</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm6gTyHKZ0A">back turned</a> upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!</p>
<p>Amongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly "back to basics" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Alien: Isolation was kind of what made me see that Alien could truly be terrifying and done well [today]," Álvarez told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/inside-total-film-podcast/">Total Film</a> in an interview passed along by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/alien-romulus-alien-isolation-easter-egg-emergency-phone/">Gamesradar</a>. "I played a few years after it came out. Don't Breathe was coming out. Or was I waiting for Don't Breathe to come out, and I was playing the game. That's why, at the time, I was like, 'fuck, if I could do anything, I would love to do Alien and scare the audience again with that creature and those environments'. I was playing, and realising how terrifying Alien could be if you take it back to that tone."</p>
<p>It's not clear how much Romulus borrows from Isolation, but the premise is certainly redolent: the film sees a cast of foolhardy young colonists scavenging from a derelict space station, which proves to be a nest of slithering horrors. And telephones. "The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone," Álvarez explained. "In the game, every time you knew there's a phone you'd go 'fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece'. It's the same thing here. You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like, brace for impact."</p>
<p>I find this Easter egg (kindly reminder: you should be wary of anything egglike in an Alien scenario) intriguing for a couple of reasons. Firstly: assuming this isn't a bluff, Álvarez has sort of spoiled the movie's scares in advance. As and when I see Romulus, I'm going to be playing Spot The Telephone and taking refuge behind my comfort blanket accordingly. Secondly, I like how Álvarez has entangled the cues and expectations of video games and film, trusting in the audience to be savvy with each medium. Perhaps his next picture could try something similar with large, empty arenas decked with chest-high walls and oil barrels. Is there a cinematic equivalent for discovering a pile of health refills next to an innocent-looking exit door?</p>
<p>Dutiful closing note that Alien: Isolation has no sequel despite the praise, and that we’re unlikely to get one given that Sega have recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-devs-creative-assembly-to-refocus-on-offline-rts-games-after-ditching-online-shooter-hyenas">tasked Creative Assembly with focusing on what they're best known for, aka Total War</a>. There <em>are</em> Alien games in the offing, at least. We've heard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-gets-long-requested-quality-of-life-updates-as-developers-start-work-on-new-project">rumblings of a new project at Aliens: Fireteam Elite developers Cold Iron</a>, though the developers have yet to confirm whether it's Xenomorph-related. In other news, while it's possible to die while saving in Alien: Isolation, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-turned-my-pc-off-during-the-dont-switch-off-symbol-in-five-different-games-to-see-what-would-happen-and-boy-was-this-an-annoying-experiment">you can be reasonably assured at least that quitting while saving won't wreck your save file</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following the release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> had plans to launch a standalone multiplayer game. Prior to the base game's PS4 debut, the developer confirmed this multiplayer aspect would not be released alongside Part 2, as had been expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">Back in 2019</a>, Naughty Dog explained its efforts to evolve The Last of Us Part 1's multiplayer Factions mode for the sequel "grew beyond an additional mode that could be included with our enormous single player campaign" and therefore it would release separately.</p>
<p>The project then hit a number of stumbling blocks, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-says-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time">Naughty Dog stating more time was required as recently as May 2023</a>. But, despite this, the studio maintained the game was coming up until last December, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us' standalone multiplayer project was ultimately cancelled</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this time, the studio said when faced with the choice to become a "solely live service games studio" or continuing "to focus on single-player narrative games" - something the studio is predominantly known for - it chose the latter.</p>
<p>Since then, Naughty Dog hasn't elaborated on the ramifications of cancelling its long-in-the-works project. However, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has now said that the move to cease development on the release "was not a bloodless endeavour".</p>
<p>Speaking on the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnduZPaqx5Q&amp;list=PLbcyJSeTLtlwyCd8BWh0iFvhJzmn9B6NN&amp;index=1">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Schreier discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">recent layoffs at Destiny developer Bungie</a>. During his time on the podcast, the reporter described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-delay-to-half-its-planned-live-service-games">Sony's live-service push</a> - along with the wider industry's - as "trend chasing".</p>
<p>"The list of games that have been pivots from single player studios to trying to make service online games that just turned out to be debacles is very, very long," he said. "I think I've done postmortems for a lot of them - the cycle is 'single-player studio super successful, pivots to live service. Spends seven years making a live service game nobody wants. Live service game comes out, it's a debacle'."</p>
<p>He then touched on The Last of Us, saying he was pleased that the studio managed to avoid that cycle thanks to the cancellation of its own multiplayer. But, even though the studio managed to break the cycle by not releasing its game, there were still consequences.</p>
<p>"I mean, Naughty Dog's Factions game was in development for something like four years with a team in the hundreds. Like, that is an expensive proposition for something that was a miss," Schreier said (thanks <a href="https://x.com/Dream_WaIker/status/1822043590345760775">Dream Walker</a>). "That project, like that getting cancelled, was not a bloodless endeavour.</p>
<p>"There were some heads rolling at Sony as a result of that one."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Despite their earlier boom in popularity, interest in live service games has waned and, according to a recent survey, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">70 percent of developers now have concerns about their sustainability</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">video game industry has seen devastating job cuts across the sector</a> over the last two years, as the post-pandemic dust settles.</p>
<p>As for Naughty Dog, Neil Druckmann recently said the developer "will not be The Last of Us studio forever". At the time, the studio head also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog has a number of games in the works</a>, including "multiple single-player projects".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft allowed lead developer Ubisoft Quebec four years to make Assassin's Creed Shadows, a one-year increase over previous franchise installments like Valhalla. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/four-years-offers-the-right-balance-to-make-a-new-assassins-creed-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, Lead Producer Karl Onnée said this is just the right amount of time.</p>
<p><em>It's great to work on a game that comes after something with the pedigree of Valhalla. But obviously, there are great expectations. We always want to go better, which is what we're trying to do with Shadows. We are pushing the limits of what we can do.</em></p>
<p><em>It's always a balance between time and costs, but the more time you have, the more you can iterate. Yes, you can put more people on a project and do it in a shorter time, but that doesn't give you more time to iterate, because it takes time to get the feedback from your players, your team… and then see what works and what doesn't and how to improve it. Four years, I think, is the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt.</em></p>
<p>Onnée also admitted that Assassin's Creed Shadows borrowed the stealth mechanics from Mirage. Overall, the various Ubisoft teams working on the franchise collaborate a lot.</p>
<p><em>During production, we do playtests with people from different places at different stages. We look at what works and what doesn't, and we also look at the playtests with Mirage and see what people like. We knew we were going in the direction of stealth with Assassin's Creed Shadows, and so we saw what they were doing and learned from that. We said, let's use what they've done and build on top of it rather than going our own way. We are all part of the brand, so it is important that we all discuss with each other. You want to avoid redoing work.</em></p>
<p><em>Making games is difficult. It takes a lot of time and passion, and you want to avoid doing the same things but differently. You want to build on top of work and improve on it. We have a lot of discussions with other teams to make sure if we're doing similar things, we can collaborate and so if they want to do something afterwards, we can take that into account. That's what we do with our new Anvil pipeline, which is the tech teams working together. When we build new features, we make sure those features are available for all projects. We are continuing to build and improve all the time.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on November 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

This comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-may-finally-be-coming-datamine-suggests">a datamine of developer Rockstar Games' website in May 2024 also mentioned a PC port</a>.</p><p>"Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever," the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store</a> page reads, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/wario64/status/1823224534159196470?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Wario64</a> on X/Twitter. "Also included is Undead Nightmare, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/27/red-dead-redemption-undead-nightmare-review">the iconic horror story that transforms the world of Red Dead Redemption</a> into an apocalyptic fight for survival against a zombie horde."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The post continues to mention further PC elements: "Featuring the complete single player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/now-red-dead-redemption-is-60fps-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-s-players-want-the-same">the 2023 console version upgrades</a> plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound."</p><p>The description then makes clear that this version of the game does not include multiplayer content, but it's likely PC fans won't mind this and will just be happy to finally pick the game up as it approaches its 15th year anniversary.</p><p>Rockstar has long neglected PC players, not even releasing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> on PC at the same time as consoles but a year later instead. It's the same situation for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6s-announced-platforms-for-2025-release-date-dont-include-pc">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which will likely be the biggest video game launch of all time, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-gamers-brace-themselves-for-the-inevitable-gta-6-double-dip-in-2026">no PC version has been announced</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

			<p><a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/it/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D</a> is going to feature additional content not found in any other version of the game, including some story episodes focused on a specific character.</p>
<p>Ortega, the protagonist's father, will be the main character of these additional episodes, which will shed more light on him to give players a better understanding of his character and his quest to defeat the Archfiend Baramos, which led to his demise when he fell into the maw of a volcano.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D is also going to feature new battles against some formidable foes, which will put players' skills to the test. These foes, alongside the gorgeous HD-2D recreation of the game's iconic locations, are featured in the screenshots below provided by Square Enix.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D launches on November 14th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>As the series approaches its 40th anniversary (Dragon Quest originally debuted in Japan in 1986), Armor Project wanted to introduce fans to the beginning of the Erdrick Trilogy by telling the tale of Ortega, the hero who failed in his quest to defeat the evil Baramos, and his child called forth on their 16th birthday to take up the mantle and finish what his father had started. Our hands-on session opened up roughly 30-60 minutes after the opening credits, where the playable hero had gathered up three party members and ventured out for their first steps. For the hour or so that I had time to spend with Dragon Quest III HD-2D, this gave me just enough time to venture from the town of Aliahan, explore the Dreamer’s Tower, acquire the Thief Key and Wrecking Ball, and finally leave the starting region and venture out into the world proper.</em></p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-biggest-update-yet-adds-new-sectors-to-explore-plus-jetpacks-jeeps-and-laser-katanas</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-biggest-update-yet-adds-new-sectors-to-explore-plus-jetpacks-jeeps-and-laser-katanas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Everyone loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> yet no one in 1998 was brave enough to say: "Okay, but what if this was an early access crafting survival game voiced by a bunch of New Zealanders?" Those 90s cowards. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597637826894">"Crush Depth" update</a>, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.</p>

<p>That was very dramatic for a crafting sim with a pooing minigame. But still, it nicely shows off the new places you can explore, plus a skipload of smaller features. The jetpack will let you reach awkward heights. A fishing rod lets you fish not only in water but also, it seems, in the toxic sludge that appears in some parts of the facility. The laser katana will cut off zombie heads at a considerable distance (see the other video linked below). And the SUV will let you drive around underground car parks and presumably run over your friends "by accident". Good. Good. These are all very useful objects, scientifically speaking. </p>
<p>The way temperature works in the game has also been overhauled so that the effects of hot and cold environments on your delicate boffin's bod are now clearer (a frosty effect at the edge of the screen and suchlike). Alongside that there are new ways to deal with the most extreme temperatures, such as slurping coffee to warm up or eating ice cream to cool off. And on a side note, there's a new deployable item called the Moisture Teleporter, which basically creates water from thin air. Very handy, considering that up until now I've been watering all my tomato plants by walking around the offices looking for untapped water coolers. </p>
<p>There are a lot of other tweaks. The game previously added some hideous "weather" types in  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4182236270515199159">another recent update</a> - sinister fog, sickening spores, and radiation leaks. But the fog turned out to be "too foggy" and has now been "reduced in intensity, just a bit". The developers also spent some time optimising performance in some of the wonkier areas. "We tore apart some of the Sectors and put them back together in a way that allows smaller chunks of the areas to load," say Deep Field Games in the update post. "We can’t promise we fixed all of the optimization issues some scientists have experienced, but we can guarantee one thing: we gave it a pretty good shot!"</p>
<p>So yeah, those are the highlights. The game's community manager has edited together <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDwX_-lK08">a helpful and enthusiastic video</a> covering the most significant changes and additions. For people who hate to hear a human voice that is not the screaming one inside their own head, there's also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4521137097808570800/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">the full patch notes on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For me the update has perfect timing. I've been (slowly) playing the retro-styled science 'em up with some buds, and we have a playdate set for this week. Of all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a> I've tried in recent years, Abiotic Factor has the most heart. It knows how ridiculous it is to craft usable weaponry from duct tape and metal scraps, fully leaning into the absurdism of its own genre. Maybe my friends and I will get further than the opening sectors this time. I'm sick of that annoying security mech in the lobby. <em>Just who does it think it is?</em> Bloody robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are you a prospective buyer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth Wukong</a> and would like to see if your PC qualifies for uninterrupted monkeying around? Wowee, would you look at that! There's a BMW (no, not the German multinational manufacturer of vehicles) benchmarking tool out now that lets you preview how the game would run on your hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The benchmarking tool is free, only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2358720/view/4360132896055696800">Steam</a>, and separate from the game itself, clocking in at just under an 8GB download. As with most other benchmarking tools, it'll play a bunch of in-game sequences and evaluate how your PC copes with them in real time. And you can tinker with the graphics options, so you can also see whether you're able to run the game on minimum or recommended specs before its launch on 20th August.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that "test results may not fully represent the actual gaming experience and final performance at the time of the game's release", according to the devs. They also say that the tool's benchmarking results are tracked, meaning they'll be used to better identify "potential compatibility issues before the game's launch".</p>
<p>You can find the game's minimum and recommended specs at the bottom of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/">Steam page</a>, and they honestly aren't <em>too</em> bad. That's obviously with the caveat that I am not Mr. Hardware, aka our delightful James.</p>
<p>I actually spent some time with the game a little while back and thought it was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">pleasantly surprising Soulslike</a>, with real flourishes of cinema. Although I did question how it would evolve overtime, I really did appreciate the more linear exploration. "Wukong's forests, with their bamboo groves and undulating tracks, felt laid out in a way you'd expect from a real life walk, lending its relative linearity a strange sort of authenticity," I said. "A sense that you were exploring carefully selected portions of a space, where the wider world was at once there and just beyond reach at the same time - again, I think some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-video-game-worlds-are-those-you-cant-explore">best video game worlds are those you can't explore</a>."</p>
<p>If Wukong itself is appealing, many of its creators have a reputation for sexist comments and behaviour, both in public on social media and allegedly within the studio, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> last November. Game Science have yet to acknowledge IGN's reporting, and they refused to talk to me about it during the preview event above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> yet-to-be-announced PC version of Red Dead Redemption has been detailed, bizarrely, via the PlayStation Store page for game.</p>
<p>As shown in the screenshots and video below taken by Eurogamer this morning, the description as it was shortly after 8am UK time today stated players were "now" able to play Red Dead Redemption on PC "for the first time ever".</p>

<p>In addition, it detailed some PC specific features. "Featuring the complete single-player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound," the sales page read.</p>
<p>Since I first checked this morning, this sales page for Red Dead Redemption has been altered twice. As I was writing, the store page still mentioned those PC specific enhancements, but the opening line which promised the ability to play on PC "now" had been removed.</p>
<p>When I hit refresh again on the page just now, those enhancements have also been expunged from the PlayStation store page.</p>

Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-1-finally-heading-to-pc-new-datamine-suggests">evidence emerged of a PC release via a datamine</a>, which revealed Rockstar had updated its PC launcher site file with a series of new "marketing strings". Those on social media pointed out this is the same way Rockstar promotes another of its flagship games, the evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5-review">GTA 5</a>.</p>
<p>As Matt reported at the time, the biggest reveal regarding that elusive PC version came from the line of text within the files that read: "Journey across the sprawling American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare - now playable on PC."</p>
<p>Seems like it is only a matter of when, not if, Rockstar finally releases one of its all time greats onto PC. Eurogamer has asked Rockstar for further comment. We will keep you posted when we hear more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve's third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> hasn't been officially revealed yet, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/">thousands of you unscrupulous devils have been playing it thanks to stolen development builds</a>. Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/looks-like-valves-next-game-is-deadlock-a-multiplayer-shooter-moba-mix-of-overwatch-dota-and-team-fortress">Valve's obstinate silence about it</a>, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.</p><!--more-->
<p>The scale of the leaks means we have a pretty solid idea of how Deadlock plays. In particular, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">Verge</a>'s Sean Hollister has wangled his way into playing a few rounds of the leaked build, publishing some thoughts and thereby attracting the wrath of Valve's orbital banhammer.</p>
<p>The short version is that this is sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> with more of a MOBA-style, lanes-and-creeps component, and a steampunk setting that reminds me of Dishonored's Dunwall (also, a microtransaction store, but you were expecting that). It's a 6v6 affair, and each team gets a retinue of NPC Troopers who spawn continually at your base and attempt to conquer a series of enemy positions. Smash through every opposing fortification, and you'll reach their base and fight their Patron - a huge, flying orb with arms. The game's heroes (there are 20 in the leaked development build) get light and heavy attacks plus a parry.</p>
<p>You can also trade resources from slain enemies for special abilities as the match goes on - for example: lifesteal, energy barriers, some kind of electro-grapple - but you can only do so back at base. Which is where the game's skyrails come in: these Bioshock Infinitesimal fixtures allow for rapid travel up and down each map lane. According to Hollister, the skyrails are laid out away from the map's major firing lines, so you can't just relentlessly use them to assault from the air.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">SteamDB</a> and passed along by jaunty RPS children's party impersonator <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-can-all-see-that-valves-unannounced-shooter-deadlock-just-hit-over-18000-concurrent-players-gabe/">PCGamer</a>, the leaked development build peaked at 18,254 players yesterday. That makes it almost exactly as popular in the last 24 hours as Europa Universalis IV, a comparison I introduce because after 15 years of doing this, my mind has become a zero-sum hellscape in which games compete for my affections like Troopers vying to dismantle each other's Patrons - to predictably parachute in a final Deadlock analogy, because originality in games journalism is dead.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed Valve announce this soon, so we can write about it without glancing over our shoulders in fear of backstabbing. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-white-sands-project-spotted-on-starfield-voice-actor-portfolio-prompting-half-life-speculation">how about that Project White Sands</a>, eh?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
