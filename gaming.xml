            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dedicated-fan-compiles-over-1000-pages-of-dungeons-dragons-lost-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A trove of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> lost content has been compiled. Thanks to one dedicated fan of the world's most popular TTRPG, hundreds of pages of supplements believed lost forever to the internet have been restored in a single convenient compendium.</p>
<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lost Content Compendium</h2>
<p>According to a news report from <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/3.5e-web-compendium">Wargamer</a>, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content compendium is the work of Reddit user u/Yawgmothlives. The user has been collecting free support material published by Wizards of the Coast for 3.5 edition of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=E5pUPVSK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=7hM-o8hU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This material has been either made inaccessible, either intentionally removed or no longer supported by the official <em>D&amp;D</em> website in July 2014. This material includes extra abilities for certain classes, new monster statblocks, dozens of new spells, adventure locations, and additional content for previously published <em>D&amp;D</em> books.</p>
<p>This collection of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content has been called The Web Compendium. It contains 1,281 pages in total and is available for all players and TTRPG historians to enjoy via a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yt5r79daqnky372lo9lcf/The-Web-Compendium.pdf?rlkey=h2u2vsh4lovdgxbgfnkjds1kf&amp;e=2&amp;st=f9tdxb9w&amp;dl=0">dropbox link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Yawgmothlives' endeavor is a noble one in terms of media preservation. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 edition was the second-most popular edition of the game, and still has a special place in the hearts of many players. Its the ruleset that <em>D&amp;D's</em> biggest competitor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, used as its foundation.</p>
<p>Because this material was only available online, it has been subject to turbulent changes when it comes to accessibility and ownership. It is a challenge certain sites like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-loses-hachette-books-case-appeal/">Internet Archive</a> are actively struggling with.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to the dedicated work of one fan, this Dungeons &amp; Dragons lost content is now readily available again. Dive into the Epic Insights of the iconic <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. See the danger and the allure of the succubus paladin. Or perhaps dive into the eclectic power of the obscure psionic classes.</p>

Its real-time action combat gets a lot of love, as does the gorgeous setting of Valisthea which is rendered with stunning fidelity.

Of course, the reactions are hardly unanimous, and the same qualities some players love also rub others the wrong way.

Still, despite those criticisms, <em>FF16 </em>is rated as Mostly Positive on Steam with over 5,000 reviews.</p><p>While reactions to the story and gameplay are largely subjective, the PC version of <em>FF16 </em>has also drawn criticism for the prevalence of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fm2gbm/massive_stutters_in_ff16_pc_version/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fm2gbm/massive_stutters_in_ff16_pc_version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical issues</a></span> and lack of PC optimization (though some of the issues that existed at launch have been fixed in the weeks since).

                <p>It's the start of a new month, and Fanatical is kicking things off with the October 2024 edition of its Platinum Collection bundle deal. Like other Fanatical build-your-own bundle promotions, customers select from a list of games to create their own batch of discounted PC games. This month's bundle has 18 games to pick from, with various genres represented, including first-person shooters, RPGs, 3D platformers, horror games, and more. Every game is available for super cheap, and the more games you add to your bundle, the better the deal gets. Pricing starts at three games for $10 ($3.33 per key), but if you pick at least five games, the price drops to just $3 per key, and at seven or more games, you'll pay just $2.86 per game. There's no limit to how many games you can grab, meaning you could add all 18 games to your bundle and pay just $51.48 total.</p><p>There are some pretty good games to choose from here, including several hidden gems you might have missed, including the open-world first-person shooter <strong>Rage 2</strong>. Developed by Avalanche Studios as a sequel to id Software's 2011 shooter, Rage 2 is a bloody post-apocalyptic game featuring over-the-top sci-fi weapons and a vast ruined landscape to explore in giant vehicles.</p><p>Another great game to add to your bundle is <strong>No Straight Roads</strong>. This one has a great aesthetic and killer tracks to tap your feet to as you explore the world of Vinyl City, a musical metropolis under the control of an oppressive EDM empire. This is also the Encore Edition of the game that throws in a ton of extra content and gameplay tweaks.

            <p>I miss the height of Wordle mania not because of the game itself, which I still play on occasion, but because of the torrent of delightful, experimental browser-based puzzle games that followed in its wake. Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.
</p>
<p>Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The challenge is simple: a map of a part of the world has been sliced into 18 squares of equal size, and scrambled. You must reconstruct them, piecing together a jigsaw of roads and rivers, train lines and place names.
</p>
<p>This is more difficult than it may first seem. Maps have no edges, no corners, no blue sky, no easy footholds familiar to dedicated dissectologist. Instead you match coloured roads, building complexes and green fields, then look closer at road shapes and writing.
</p><p>In completing my first puzzle, I found tile after tile that linked together, but found it more difficult to position those tiles within the broader image. Did two tiles, which clearly fit together, go in the top right, the bottom left, the middle, or...? It was only after 25 minutes when I realised that I had constructed the map perfectly, but in two reversed halves: the nine tiles on the left belonged on the right, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>As I fixed that issue, placing each tile in its correct position, a green border appeared around each one. Ah. The game confirms correct answers as you play. Useful.
</p>
<p>Like Wordle, no Scrambled Map seems truly difficult, only more or less time consuming. Like Wordle, it would be easy to cheat with a visit to OpenStreetMap (the source of the map data) or Google Maps. In any case, like Wordle, I'm hooked, and eagerly awaiting each new day's puzzle.

            <p>The Football Manager series has been around for decades, each of its yearly entries gradually building upon its core systems until it became the mixture of deep simulation and banal press conference screens it is today. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> is different: a fresh start for the series, built upon a new engine, which Sports Interactive are at pains to say will not immediately be as rich or robust as its predecessor.
</p>
<p>It now has a release date: November 26th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"FM25 is not a continuation of FM24. FM 25 is: 'This is the next generation of Football Manager' - and this is the first chapter in the new book of Football Manager, and will get expanded on," studio head Miles Jacobson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last month</a>. Jacobson's comments mirror what was announced back in 2023, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">Football Manager 2024 was described as "the last of its kind"</a>.
</p>
<p>The biggest change is under the hood: Sports Interactive have traded their own proprietary engine for Unity, with the aim of upgrading the quality of 3D match engine, but also to speed up development of new features in a series that sometimes felt stagnant. 
</p><p>The implication is that Football Manager 2025 is a reset, or a short-term step backwards, to pave the way for greater and faster steps forward in future. In practical terms, it means Football Manager 2025 doesn't have some features players might be used to from recent iterations. No international management, no data chalkboard, no Create-a-Club, Challenge mode, Versus mode or Fantasy Draft. 
</p>
<p>What the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/">Football Manager 2025 Steam page</a> says it will have is the Premier League license for the first time, women's football for the first time, more playable leagues and nations than ever, a brand new UI, and the "biggest technical and visual advancement for a generation." 
</p>
<p>I'm genuinely fascinated to see how FM2025's release plays out. On a yearly update cycle, it's inevitable that there are certain big new features or upgrades that are going to be out of reach because they don't fit within the schedule. Eventually that catches up to a series. I've occasionally been frustrated by Football Manager's slow progress and the nature of its new features, too, where it sometimes seems to introduce cruft more than real innovation. A reset might not be a bad thing, but it's a risk. 
</p>
<p>Or players could just keep playing FM2024. Someone will make a database update, I'm sure. We'll find out which way things go come November 26th.

                <p>It's officially spooky season, and Microsoft is getting in the swing of things by offering a pair of scary movies to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.

            <p>
Mario + Rabbids director Davide Soliani has teamed up with Red Dead Redemption lead designer and writer Christian Cantamessa to found a new studio, Day 4 Night.
</p>
<p>
Day 4 Night's first project, a new IP co-directed by Soliani and Cantamessa, is described by Xbox co-founder Ed Fries - whose 1Up Ventures is financing the studio alongside publisher Krafton - as "easily the most creative thing we have seen in quite some time".
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, details of the team's first game are limited, although Soliani calls the studio's work "a reflection of everything I've ever wanted to experience as a player - joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends."
</p>

<p>
"It's a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry," he continued, "to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It's a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together."
</p>
<p>
More broadly, Day 4 Night - which will operate across offices in Los Angeles and Milan - <a href="http://www.d4nstudios.com/">says</a> it's "focused on delivering deeply heartfelt and original games that innovate in storytelling and design.". Other members of the team include Luca Breda, Gian Marco Zanna, and Cristina Nava, who all worked on Mario + Rabbids at Ubisoft Milan, and whose credits at Ubisoft span the likes of Ghost Recon, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
Soliani, whose 25-year stint at Ubisoft included 11 years on both Mario + Rabbids games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">announced his departure</a> from the publisher back in July, teasing a "new adventure" to come.

Some of the negativity seems to be general dogpiling by players still upset over the base game, but there are a fair number of more reasonable people explaining why the DLC may be coming up short. Many hinge on the fact that aside from the story quest,<em> Shattered Space</em> is very light on other additional content, including more ship parts, weapons, armor, and other new features.<br></p><p>It’s clear <em>Shattered Space </em>is also burdened by the bar set by other massive single-player RPGs.

Long-time Bethesda fans are also comparing <em>Shattered Space</em> to <em>Fallout 4</em>'s <em>Far Harbor</em> DLC , another expansion that offered sprawling new areas to explore and some peak storytelling moments. </p><p> I’ve been playing <em>Shattered Space</em> all week and have a lot of thoughts but will hold them until my review is published. TL;DR: it’s complicated. And you can go on the <em>Starfield </em>subreddit and find plenty of fans who enjoyed the base game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are having a terrific time with the DLC</a></span>.

While there are certainly both good and bad things about <em>Shattered Space</em> worth highlighting, it’s clear the polarized reactions are in part a response to poor expectation-setting and hopes around the expansion not just adding to the game but also feeling fundamentally different from the familiar Bethesda RPG formula that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428">creaked and strained under the weight of<em> Starfield</em>’s ambition</a></span>.</p><p>This is far from the end of the road for the Xbox console exclusive though.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Game Pass Day One Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This is in keeping with tradition for Activision and Nvidia, as 2023's Modern Warfare III also streamed through GeForce Now, as did the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta earlier this year. Call of Duty: Warzone is also available to stream through GeForce Now.</p><p>When Microsoft was in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, one of the sticking points was cloud-gaming rights. To appease regulators, Microsoft worked out a deal with Nvidia (and others) to bring future titles like Black Ops 6 to streaming services beyond Microsoft's own Xbox cloud gaming. Speaking of which, Microsoft is yet to confirm if Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox cloud gaming.</p><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2><p>GeForce Now is Nvidia's game-streaming service, and it's available throughout North America and Europe. Instead of needing a beefy rig or game console to play games locally, GeForce Now streams games from a powerful PC at Nvidia's server farm, running on GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs. Nvidia says those who subscribe to the highest, most expensive tier ($20/month) will get the best frame rates and visual fidelity, including ray-tracing. According to Nvidia, the experience is indistinguishable from playing locally--but of course that depends on the quality and consistency of your internet connection.</p><h2><strong>How to play Black Ops 6 on GeForce Now</strong></h2><p>First, you must own a copy of Black Ops 6 on Steam or Battle.net. Then, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a GeForce Now plan</a> and link your account. The cheapest plan is free, but it limits you to one hour of game time per day, has ads, and streams your game from a basic rig. The <strong>Priority </strong>membership ($10/month) gets you a premium rig with RTX on, priority access to servers, six hours of game time per day, up to 1080p/60fps, and no ads. Then there is the <strong>Ultimate </strong>package ($20/month) that streams from a RTX 4080 rig with exclusive access to 4080 servers, eight hours of daily game time, up to 4K/240fps, and no ads.</p><p>There are also Priority and Ultimate day passes available for $4 and $8, respectively.</p><h2><strong>Is Nvidia GeForce Now actually a good experience?</strong></h2><p>Given game-streaming technologies are relatively new, many might be wondering if GeForce Now is actually a good way to play Black Ops 6 or any of the other 1,500+ supported games. Reviews from sites like <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Mag</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-now-review-2023-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC World</a> are very positive about the service. Of course, though, your mileage may vary. You can see the hardware and internet speed requirements below, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/system-reqs/#windows-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Nvidia.</a></p><h3>Hardware Requirements</h3><ul><li>A 64-bit version of Windows 7 or later (32-bit versions of Windows are not supported)</li><li>Dual core x86 or x64 CPU at 2.0GHz or faster</li><li>4GB of system memory</li><li>GPU that supports DirectX 11 or later</li></ul><h3>Internet Requirements</h3><ul><li>15 Mbps for HD resolutions at up to 60 FPS (e.g. 1280x720)</li><li>25 Mbps for FHD resolutions at 60 FPS (e.g. 1920x1080)</li><li>35 Mbps for UW QHD &amp; QHD resolutions at 120 FPS (e.g. 3840x1440 or 2560x1440)</li><li>45 Mbps for 4K resolutions at 120 FPS (e.g. 3840x2160)</li></ul><p>Nvidia said it recommends a hardwired Ethernet connection or a router with a 5 GHz WiFi connection for the best results. Also worth noting is that GeForce Now will only work for you if there is less than 80ms of network latency between you and a Nvidia data center. Here's <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5224" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to test your network for GeForce Now.</a></p><p>On the control side, Nvidia said it recommends a USB gaming mouse for the best experience. GeForce Now also supports Xbox and PlayStation controllers, along with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/recommended/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">range of other gamepads.</a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about Black Ops 6. </a></p>

            <p>"Turn-based" games are, as we know, all derived from Turn, the strategy game about a dog digging for coins released for the BBC Micro in 1987. Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 
</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">turn-based RPG fest</a> featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is 40% reduced, Age Of Wonders 4 is 35% discounted, the recently released Tactical Breach Wizards is 10% off, Octopath Traveller 2 has been slashed by 40%, and XCOM2 is an absurd 95% taken-offed. I'll stop there because I'm obviously out of synonyms for "on sale".
</p>
<p>These genre specific Fests tend to attract fewer pre-release demos than other Steam events, particularly this close to the more demo-centric Next Fest, which happens in a couple of weeks. The most downloaded demos of the fest so far are recent releases such as Multiverse Loot Hunter and Backpack Battles, and recent-ish staples like Dragon Quest 11 S and the aforementioned Octopath Traveller 2.
</p><p>Still, browsing the menu did introduce me to Silence Of The Siren, which released in Early Access just a few days ago. It's from the developers of Project Hospital and it's a sci-fi strategy game in the vein of Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic. Looks neat! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/">grab the demo from its store page</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">Turn-Based Fest</a> runs from now until October 7th. Turn developer Stephen "Turn" Turner would be proud.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former Ubisoft game director, Rockstar Games game designer, and veteran producers in the industry have launched a <a href="http://d4nstudios.com/#GameDev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">brand new studio</a>, Day 4 Night. </p>



<p>Mario + Rabbids game director Davide Soliani and Red Dead Redemption lead designer Christian Cantamessa are two of the more prominent co-founders of the studio. Also co-founding the studio are Chrtinia Nava, Luca Breda, and Glan Marco Zanna, all of whom worked as producers on franchises such as Star Wars, Ghost Recon, Mario + Rabbids, and Just Dance.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-former-ea-developers-form-the-three-thousands-studio-in-australia">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-ea-developers-form-the-three-thousands-studio-in-australia/">Former EA Developers Form The Three Thousands Studio in Australia</a></h6>



<p>The studio has secured funding from publisher Krafton as well as Xbox co-creator Ed Fries and is 1UP Ventures. Day 4 Night is already working on its first game that is being co-directed by Soliani and Cantamessa.</p>



<p>“What we are crafting at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player – joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends,” Soliani said via release.</p>



<p>“It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together.”</p>



<p>Soliani <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mariorabbids-creative-director-davide-soliani-exits-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Ubisoft in June</a> after 25 years with the company.</p>



<p>As far as the first game is concerned, it is based on a brand new IP from the studio. In the release, Fries says that what’s being worked on from the company is  “easily the most creative thing we have seen in quite some time.”</p>



<p>More details on the studio’s first game will come in the future.</p>

He's not in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/124199/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-featuring-the-legend-/credits/switch/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crypt of the Necrodancer: Cadence of Hyrule</a>, for instance, nor is he listed in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/150320/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity/credits/switch/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> (though he is listed in the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/68628/hyrule-warriors/credits/wii-u/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original Hyrule Warriors</a> as a special thanks). And Miyamoto is also nowhere to be found in either early CD-i Zelda game,  <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21133/zeldas-adventure/credits/cd-i/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zelda's Adventure</a> or <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/21134/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon/credits/cd-i/?autoplatform=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wand of Gamalon</a>.</p><p>But in all those cases, it's pretty understandable why the series creator wasn't especially involved. They were all developed entirely by outside studios, in genres and styles that are arguably not "core Zelda." But Echoes of Wisdom feels different. Even though it's co-developed by Grezzo, the outside studio worked in partnership with Nintendo EPD. And even though Zelda's the protagonist and the gameplay's a bit different, there's really no arguing that it's not a "mainline Zelda game" by every possible metric. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Rather, this seems to be further evidence of Miyamoto stepping back a bit from game development. Though he told us earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-isnt-retiring-anytime-soon">he's not retiring anytime soon</a>, Miyamoto has been more focused on "finding unique opportunities for Nintendo" such as the company's efforts in film and amusement parks. And we've seen further evidence that's happening as his role has diminished on other recent game projects, too. After <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/36620/shigeru-miyamoto/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years of being credited as a producer</a> on just about every major Nintendo game possible, Miyamoto's more recent credits on games like Princess Peach: Showtime! and Super Mario Bros. Wonder just list him as a "supervisor." It's indicative that he's increasingly handing the controls over to others at Nintendo.</p><p>GoNintendo also notes that Zelda veteran Takashi Tezuka was also seemingly not involved in Echoes of Wisdom, though Tezuka was not listed for Tears of the Kingdom, either, and seems to be similarly taking on a reduced role on the series in recent years.</p><p>Tezuka and Miyamoto's legacies on the series are going strong even if they're stepping back, though. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">gave Echoes of Wisdom a 9/10 in our review</a>, calling it "far more than some second-tier spinoff, combining the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D Zelda with the wild creativity provided by Tears of the Kingdom."

Since two of the three main modes are objective-based, you’re likely to run into multiple enemies simultaneously. The last thing you want to happen is to die as soon as you pull up. To combat this, always stay with your friends and push up together. This will increase your chances of surviving the bigger fights throughout the game.</p><h2 id="h27896"><a id=""></a><strong>Spawns reset</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s fun about <em>Space Marine 2</em> multiplayer is that it has old-school spawns—that means both teams will spawn on opposite ends of the current map. If you ever get spawn trapped, don’t worry, because as the game continues spawns will gradually reset to help combat this. But if you are the one spawn camping, keep this in mind, too.</p><h2 id="h27897"><a id=""></a><strong>Look up more</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-recommend-id="image://475fbf7cc331b2d32ae411e9547a60f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Always take the time to look up while fighting. Because more times than not, you’ll find an Assault class up in the air, building up the strength to kill you. If they land, they’ll inflict enough damage to turn the tide of that battle.</p><h2 id="h27898"><a id=""></a><strong>Melee damage cuts through shields</strong></h2><p>One of the things that makes melee attacks so dangerous is that they ignore shields altogether. The second you’re hit with one, your HP will automatically be affected by this, and your shields will remain the same (unless you’re being shot at, too).</p><h2 id="h27899"><a id=""></a><strong>Find ammo boxes</strong></h2><p>Once you spawn in, you won’t be able to pick up ammo from fallen players. But it’s not all doom and gloom, because every map has ammo boxes scattered around. These won’t completely refill your ammo, but they’ll give you enough to get back into the fight.</p><h2 id="h27900"><a id=""></a><strong>You only get one grenade</strong></h2><p>Each time you spawn, you can only have one grenade at a time. So, if you plan on using it, make sure it’s worth it—you won’t be getting another one until you spawn back.</p><h2 id="h27901"><a id=""></a><strong>Spam your abilities</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-recommend-id="image://bc5913240ebf9d628bf1beee0aaf7596" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In most online games, when shooters have special abilities, you need to be smart when using them. But that is not the case when it comes to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. You will be fully charged and ready to go the second you spawn in, to the point where you’re encouraged to run into battle with your ability activated—that’ll definitely help give you the upper hand.</p><h2 id="h27902"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s okay to give up ground</strong></h2><p>Now and then, you may find yourself stuck when trying to capture the objective, because the enemy team is holding it down. If that’s the case, giving up the objective is sometimes okay—this will give you and your team plenty of time to get to the next zone without much of a fight.</p><h2 id="h27903"><a id=""></a><strong>Be open to changing classes mid-game</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-recommend-id="image://cb731a3677aecb67072fc2711d37363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in a game and make no progress. If you find yourself dying repeatedly, it’s probably a sign that you should change classes and try something new. Your current class just isn’t working right now.</p><h2 id="h27904"><a id=""></a><strong>Bulwark shields absorb a lot of damage</strong></h2><p>Bulwarks are extremely useful because, on top of being able to heal up teammates, their shields can absorb almost anything thrown at them, including grenades. This is great, especially if you’re trying to capture a zone. You can have them run up the field and take all the damage.</p><h2 id="h27905"><a id=""></a><strong>Learn melee combos</strong></h2><p>It’s crucial to take the time to learn the melee combos. If you and another enemy are going blow for blow, and you’re spamming basic attacks, they’ll win that fight every time. If you’re unsure of how to perform a combo, pause the game (not mid-fight, obviously!), and you’ll be shown which buttons you need to press.</p><h2 id="h27906"><a id=""></a><strong>Vanguard ziplines can be used to travel</strong></h2><p>The Vanguard zip attack can also be used to travel across the map. If you find yourself on the verge, you can easily escape with the zipline, and on top of that, it can also be used to reach harder places that you couldn’t get to otherwise.</p><h2 id="h27907"><a id=""></a><strong>Assault classes should never be on the ground</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-recommend-id="image://5ba8db60d149f17801e0626c74cf85c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Assault class has the quickest rechargeability rate out of all of them. This makes sense because their class is built around making aerial attacks. With that in mind, when playing Assault, you should rarely be on the ground, because you’ll have a low amount of armor and no useful skills.</p><h2 id="h27908"><a id=""></a><strong>Use the camera to your advantage</strong></h2><p>Use the camera angles to your advantage!

<p>Game streaming platform Antstream Arcade is the next company in the industry to suffer a round of layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/antstream-arcade-makes-small-number-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the company points to the “very challenging period” in the games industry as well as a “strategic shift” within the company as reasons for the layoffs.</p>



<p>“The games industry is currently facing a very challenging period,” the statement reads. “Due to a strategic shift in focus internally, we have made the difficult decision to make a small number of redundancies within the Antstream Arcade team.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly, and we will be working to support those affected throughout the process. Antstream Arcade remains dedicated to delivering the best possible experience to our players.”</p>



<p>“I have the sad news that I have been made redundant,” PR and communications manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246812630252752897/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Diane Hutchinson wrote</a> on LinkedIn. “I have enjoyed the time I’ve been with Antstream and appreciate everyone that welcomed me to the company.</p>



<p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-set-to-get-1300-classic-games-with-antstream-arcade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently launched on PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 4 in September. The platform brings over 1,300 classic games to players via a subscription service.</p>



<p>The number of employees affected by the layoffs is not yet known. As of writing, roughly <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 jobs have been lost</a> across nearly 150 companies in the games industry in 2024. </p>

The studio, which is focused on creating content that “pushes the boundaries of storytelling and game design,” is currently developing an “entirely original new game.” <span id="more-919393"></span></p><p>The studio also announced that it has secured its first round of financing, led by major publisher <a title="Companies > KRAFTON [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton">KRAFTON</a>, and with participation from <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,910 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> co-creator Ed Fries’ 1Up Ventures.</p><p>“When I first fell in love with video games at the start of my career, I saw the power of this new medium to tell stories never told before and create worlds that could transform people,” said Christian Cantamessa in a press release. “Day 4 Night is a return to that innovative spirit, to that innocence, to that unbridled creativity.”</p><p>Davide Soliani added, “What we are <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player – joy, <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,797 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, poetry, <a title="Genres > Action [2,222 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends. It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together.”</p><p>Cantamessa and Soliani are joined by co-founders Cristina Nava, Gian Marco Zanna, and Luca Breda, who previously worked on major franchises including <em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, <em>Just Dance</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><p>“Day 4 Night’s pitch presented a highly engaging and captivating story,” said KRAFTON vice president and head of corporate development Maria Park. “The game’s vision stands out as both original and creative, making it a great match for the type of studios we aim to support at KRAFTON. It aligns well with our mission to ‘Scale up the Creative.'”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>1Up Ventures’ Ed Fries said, “When you see a lot of pitches, like we do, it’s always incredibly fun when you get to hear an idea that’s completely new and original.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/bazzite-is-a-wonderful-steamos-ish-port-for-lots-of-non-valve-handhelds/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>I was on vacation last week, the kind of vacation in which entire days had no particular plan. I had brought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">the ROG Ally X</a> with me, and, with the review done and Windows still annoying me, I looked around at the DIY scene, wondering if things had changed since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">my last foray into DIY Steam Deck cloning</a>.</p>
<p>Things had changed for the better. I tried out <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a>, and after dealing with the typical Linux installation tasks—activating the BIOS shortcut, turning off Secure Boot, partitioning—I had the Steam Deck-like experience I had sought on this more powerful handheld. Since I installed Bazzite, I have not had to mess with drivers, hook up to a monitor and keyboard for desktop mode, or do anything other than play games.</p>
<p>Until Valve officially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">makes SteamOS available for the ROG Ally</a> and (maybe) other handhelds, Bazzite is definitely worth a look for anyone who thinks their handheld could do better.</p>

      Bazzite says that you can swap an SD card full of games between any two systems running Bazzite. This kind of taunting possibility is very effective on people like me.

<h2>More game platforms, more customization, same Steam-y feel</h2>
<p>There are a few specific features for the ROG Ally X tossed into Bazzite, and the Linux desktop is Fedora, not Arch. Beyond that, it is like SteamOS but better, especially if you want to incorporate non-Steam games. Bazzite bakes in apps like <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a>, <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl">Heroic</a>, and <a href="https://www.junkstore.xyz/">Junk Store</a>, which Steam Deck owners often turn to for loading in games from Epic, GOG, itch.io, and other stores, as well as games with awkward Windows-only launchers.</p>
<p>You don't even need to ditch Windows, really. If you're using a handheld like the ROG Ally X, with its 1TB of storage, you can <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">dual-boot Bazzite and Windows</a> with some crafty partition shrinking. By all means, check that your game saves are backed up first, but you can, with some guide-reading, venture into Bazzite without abandoning the games for which you need Windows.</p>
<p>Perhaps most useful to the type of person who owns a gaming handheld and also will install Linux on it, Bazzite gives you powerful performance customization at the click of a button. Tap the ROG Ally's M1 button on the back, and you can mess with Thermal Design Power (TDP), set a custom fan curve, change the charge limit, tweak CPU and GPU parameters, or even choose a scheduler. I most appreciated this for the truly low-power indie games I played, as I could set the ROG Ally below its standard 13 W "Silent" profile down to a custom 7 W without heading deep into Asus' Armoury Crate.</p>
