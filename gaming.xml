<!-- cache hit 49:single/related:41722374be77d946703ad465fcf26d84 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Friday, a retired software engineer named Martin C. Martin <a href="https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/">announced</a> that he recently discovered a bug in the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> computer game's physics code while tinkering with the software. Created by a <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">17-year-old high school student named Jim Storer</a> in 1969, this primordial game rendered the action only as text status updates on a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-forgotten-world-of-teletype-computer-games">teletype</a>, but it set the stage for future versions to come.</p>

<p>The legendary game—which Storer developed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a> minicomputer in a programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)">FOCAL</a> just months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic moonwalks—allows players to control a lunar module's descent onto the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage their fuel usage to achieve a gentle landing, making critical decisions every ten seconds to burn the right amount of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2009, just short of the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing, I set out to find the author of the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> game, which was then primarily known as a graphical game, thanks to the <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/gt40/">graphical version</a> from 1974 and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)">1979 Atari arcade title</a>. When I discovered that Storer created the oldest known version as a teletype game, I interviewed him and wrote up <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">a history of the game</a>. Storer later <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">released the source code</a> to the original game, written in FOCAL, on his website.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2024, when Martin—an AI expert, game developer, and former postdoctoral associate at MIT—stumbled upon a bug in Storer's high school code while exploring what he believed was the optimal strategy for landing the module with maximum fuel efficiency—a technique known among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/video-astronaut-scott-kelly-teaches-orbital-mechanics-with-kerbal-space-program/"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a> enthusiasts as the "suicide burn." This method involves falling freely to build up speed and then igniting the engines at the last possible moment to slow down just enough to touch down safely. He also tried another approach—a more gentle landing.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"I recently explored the optimal fuel burn schedule to land as gently as possible and with maximum remaining fuel," Martin wrote on his blog. "Surprisingly, the theoretical best strategy didn’t work. The game falsely thinks the lander doesn’t touch down on the surface when in fact it does. Digging in, I was amazed by the sophisticated physics and numerical computing in the game. Eventually I found a bug: a missing 'divide by two' that had seemingly gone unnoticed for nearly 55 years."</p>
<h2>A matter of division</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg" data-height="459" data-width="720" alt="Diagram of launch escape system on top of the Apollo capsule."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg" data-height="459" data-width="720">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Diagram of launch escape system on top of the Apollo capsule.</p><p>NASA</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite applying what should have been a textbook landing strategy, Martin found that the game inconsistently reported that the lander had missed the Moon's surface entirely. Intrigued by the anomaly, Martin dug into the game's source code and discovered that the landing algorithm was based on highly sophisticated physics for its time, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> expansion.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the quote above, the root of the problem was a simple computational oversight—a missing division by two in the formula used to calculate the lander's trajectory. This seemingly minor error had big consequences, causing the simulation to underestimate the time until the lander reached its lowest trajectory point and miscalculate the landing.</p>

<p>Despite the bug, Martin was impressed that Storer, then a high school senior, managed to incorporate advanced mathematical concepts into his game, a feat that remains impressive even by today's standards. Martin reached out to Storer himself, and the <em>Lunar Lander</em> author told Martin that his father was a physicist who helped him derive the equations used in the game simulation.</p>
<p>While people played and enjoyed Storer's game for years with the bug in place, it goes to show that realism isn't always the most important part of a compelling interactive experience. And thankfully for Aldrin and Armstrong, the real Apollo lunar landing experience didn't suffer from the same issue.</p>

<p>Longtime fans of <em>Diablo II</em> are deeply familiar with the extreme timesink that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">the late-game grind for the very best loot</a>. But when the creators of <em>Diablo IV</em> tried to re-create that style of grinding for the latest game in the series, they found that their players' tastes had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/is-there-a-paladin-in-diablo-4">a wide-ranging interview with Windows Central</a>, Blizzard's general manager of <em>Diablo</em>, Rod Fergusson, said that they launched <em>Diablo IV</em> under "the assumption that <em>D4</em> was meant to be more <em>D2</em>-like." That meant, in part, increasing the length of time required to discover the game's most valuable items after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/diablo-3-says-goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-the-auction-house/">post-Auction-House <em>Diablo 3</em> made rare item drops much more common</a>.</p>
<p>"One of the assumptions was that people were going to be okay with the long grind for the Unique or an Uber Unique in particular, because in <em>Diablo II</em>, it can go years," Fergusson said. "You can go three years before you find the Uber you're looking for... and so we were like, okay, this is what people love about the progression of <em>D2</em>, that idea of that very long chase."</p>
<p>Once the game launched, though, Fergusson said the development team was surprised to find players complaining of how long it took to get some items—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/diablo-4-review-off-to-a-hell-of-a-good-start/">our own review</a> expressed concern about the "'loot treadmill' approach to the endgame" and "loot drops [that] seem tuned a bit low for my taste."
</p><p>"We found out very quickly that if you don't give me my Uber in my [months-long] season, then I'm upset," Fergusson said. "And so we're like, oh, wow, okay."</p>
<h2>Changing with the players</h2>
<p>To help calm those upset players, subsequent <em>Diablo IV</em> updates have <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/new-sources-of-resplendent-sparks-coming-in-diablo-4-season-4-339176">made it easier to earn Resplendent Sparks</a>, which those players can use to craft high-end Uber Unique items they've been unable to find from random item drops. Having that option to skip the randomized item search helped satisfy the desires of modern players, Fergusson said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"It's just a kind of recognition of how much players have changed in 20 years," he said. "You know... that consumptive nature of a live service and that time is money and I don't have much time, so let's go, right? And so that idea of like, oh, you're going to get a unique every six months."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d2grind.png" data-height="600" data-width="800" alt="Ah, the old-fashioned joy of finding an item with a wall of ability text."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d2grind.png" data-height="600" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Ah, the old-fashioned joy of finding an item with a wall of ability text.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That recognition of "how much players have changed" reflects how much the mere passage of time has changed the <em>Diablo</em> audience over the years. A 16-year-old who was sinking all their free time into <em>Diablo II</em> when it launched in 2000 is pushing 40 these days. That means the core, nostalgic audience for the series is now very likely to have a career, family, and/or other responsibilities eating into their playtime. There's nothing like a few decades of aging to make the prospect of sinking hundreds of hours into a loot grind seem less appealing.</p>
<p>With <em>Diablo III</em>, Blizzard initially assumed that players with more money than time would simply bid up the game's best items in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/diablo-3-will-let-you-buy-and-sell-items-for-real-world-cash/">the game's real-money auction house</a>, where players who had more time to grind would benefit from selling their rarest random finds. Instead, Blizzard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/diablo-3-to-permanently-remove-its-auction-houses-in-march-2014/">soon acknowledged</a> that the auction system "short-circuited [the] core reward loop" of the game, making it trivial to buy high-level loot that quickly made the entire late-game feel kind of irrelevant.</p>
<p>With <em>Diablo IV</em>, Blizzard seems to have struck a better balance for players who simply want a more reliable reward for any time investment they can make. With Resplendent Sparks, players willing to put in the in-game work can be confident that they'll eventually get the top-level items they're seeking. That consistency can be much more appealing for time-limited players than simply crossing your fingers for a low-odds virtual dice roll or opening your wallet to skip the gameplay grind process entirely.</p>
<p>The evolution of <em>Diablo</em>'s item progression system is an important reminder of how the relative value of a player's time can change as those players move between different stages of life. Who knows, maybe in 25 years <em>Diablo VI</em> will find success with ultra-rare item drops that soak up all the free time for a core audience of retirement-age players with nothing better to do than spend 500 hours grinding for a digital sword.</p>

Affected players are said to have manipulated Star Citizen’s systems to duplicate items and gain more of its in-game currency, Alpha United Earth Credits (aUEC). All aUEC gained using these methods have been removed from the ecosystem.</p><p>CIG thanks Star Citizen players for raising awareness about these issues, explaining that in-game exploits like the ones being squashed now “undermine the integrity of our game and the efforts of our dedicated backers who help us build Star Citizen.” The developer promises to continue addressing cheating players as issues arise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/star-citizen-1718388157332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Star Citizen exploit investigation leads to CIG suspending more than 600 accounts.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“At this stage of development, exploits and issues like these are likely to arise, which is one of the benefits of open development and working closely with our community,” CIG said. “Identifying, testing, and reporting exploits is acceptable and encouraged. We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that. However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part.”</p><p>Other Star Citizen players suspect the 600 suspensions are tied to players who were selling their unauthorized credits for real-world cash. Specifically, users called out those who have taken to third-party bidding websites like eBay, where millions of aUEC is sold for anywhere from one dollar to hundreds of dollars.</p><p>“Yup, I noticed a peculiar amount of posts here recently both defending and supporting third-party aUEC sales, which is very odd to me, as gold selling/buying is an almost universally reviled practice in most MMOs,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1df99o1/comment/l8hgqkf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “I wouldn't even be slightly surprised if it was the exploiters themselves encouraging that BS to make a quick shady buck.”</p><p>IGN has reached out to CIG for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Star Citizen is CIG’s long-in-development sci-fi game. It’s been sold as an ambitious MMO that allows players to immerse themselves within an enormous space sim experience, but despite being announced in 2012, its launch build has never actually been released. Last month, we reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-pushes-through-the-700-million-raised-mark-and-no-there-still-isnt-a-release-date"><u>that Star Citizen managed to raise more than $700 million in the 12 years since its reveal</u></a>.</p><p>Star Citizen’s drawn-out development has turned it into one of the most controversial games ever, but CIG has recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-10-twinkles-on-the-horizon-dev-says-12-years-and-669-million-later"><u>started to openly talk about a 1.0 launch</u></a>.

With Christian McCaffrey as this year's cover athlete, the description of Boom Tech aligns with EA's theme of trying to pick cover athletes that best fit the new editions coming to Madden in a given year. </p><p>Additional upgrades to FieldSense, thanks to Boom Tech, are needed to "deliver increased authenticity" in offense, defense, and special teams. This includes a reloaded hit stick that will now be a skill-based mechanic, with playing ratings influencing the impact of the hit stick.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>To increase offensive immersion, EA notes that Ball Carrier will introduce new jukes, spins, and hesi releases. The new NFL kickoff rules will be added when the game is released this August. In addition to new branching catches, there will be new pass block strategy mechanics. </p><p>"It's been incredibly rewarding to grow with the Maden NFL experience alongside our players the past two years, and we're excited to deliver even more of the control, depth, and immersion they're looking for in Madden NFL 25," Madden NFL Senior Production Director Mike Mahar wrote in a press release. "Boom Tech has been multiple years in the making and represents the most impactful FieldSense improvement yet, and combined with a new audio and visual experience across the game, plus deepened modes and increased customization, Madden NFL 25 will look, feel, and sound different."</p><p>Madden NFL 25 is out on August 16th and is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">now available for pre-order</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it.902130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’ve had the opportunity to play Path of Exile 2 several times throughout its development cycle, and there’s one thought I had after my latest session: this action-RPG keeps getting better every time I play it.</p><p>The first session I had the opportunity to join was a demo at Gamescom 2023. Grinding Gear’s Jonathan Rogers took me through the Warrior and Druid class, and I also had the opportunity to wait in line and try out the Monk for the first time. As expected, I got my butt kicked. But that’s par for the course. In early 2024 I had the chance to try out the Ranger, whose incredibly fun gameplay loop has you shooting lightning arrows and propagating lightning storms of death across the screen. And more recently I got to try out the Monk again and get some hands-on time with the Warrior, Sorceress, and Witch – all for the first time. Each of them feels unique, powerful, and interesting to play as. The Monk, once you get past the early leveling portions that have you whacking away at enemies with slow and methodical staff strikes, becomes a force to be reckoned with. You can dash in to weaken your enemies, get a few charges, and then annihilate the playing field with an incredibly powerful staff strike to the ground that sends ripples of energy that rip into the earth itself. And once I got the hang of this class's gameplay loop, I felt like I may have found another new favorite.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Path of Exile 2 Witch Gameplay</h3></div></output><p>But the majority of my time I found myself playing as the Witch, who was one of the first classes I enjoyed in the original Path of Exile. In the sequel, the Witch starts out as a corpse-reviving menace who chooses what abilities the minions will wield, and can even command them to do unique attacks to great effect.</p><p>The Unearth skill gem, for instance, will create spikes of bone that travel from the earth in front of you doing a bit of damage, but will also raise the bones of corpses as short-lived construct minions. You’ll then start unlocking Skill Gems like Skeletal Warrior, Skeletal Sniper, and Skeletal Arsonist. Because you’ll only have a set amount of spirit, early on you’ll only be able to choose one of these to get started. The Skeletal Arsonist is the option I picked as it has the unique ability to explode any low-life minion in your pack. And not only is that very cool, but it also does a ton of damage to packs of enemies or bosses that weaken your minions to explosion status.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Later, when I unlocked Bone Cage and Contagion, I was able to further expand my tool kit to create a trap for enemies, hit them with Contagion, and then watch it propagate across enemies – killing everything it touched. Even at early levels, these builds feel very fun to use and execute, and I found myself grinning from ear to ear the entire time I played as the Witch. In addition, Grinding Gear Games gave us a sneak peek at some later-game builds, and while they are interesting, I just wanted to briefly say that the gigantic skeleton that is erected by a sorcerer looks so freaking cool. Path of Exile 2 continues to surprise me with designs that are either creepy or look like they jumped straight off the cover of a heavy metal album and into the game. I’m at the point where I don’t need to see anymore. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The power progression is feeling particularly great at this moment in time.</p></div><p>The other class that I spent a significant amount of time with for the first time was the Monk. The build-up to your more powerful attacks takes a bit of time, but somehow the Monk really surprised me. You start out with a methodical smack to the enemies you’ll face, but once you start getting your Skill Gem combat kit together, the class gets really fun – and powerful – very fast. Near the end of my demo, I had the Tempest Bell Skill Gem that would drop a massive Bell onto the battlefield. When struck with any elemental Ailments, including my Frozen Locus AOE damage, it would create an elemental shockwave and deal extra freeze damage to anything in the vicinity. But my favorite combo included Killing Palm and Staggering Palm, which let me zip into battle with a Staggering Palm Strike, drop a Frozen Locus into a group of enemies, attack the bell, and finish off anyone left over with Killing Palm. That Killing Palm final blow would then give me a Power Charge that can stack up to three times. Once powered up, you could execute Falling Thunder to create a ripple of damage that tore across the map and obliterated anything that got in the way. That sounds like a bit of a setup, and it can be, but the reward just makes it so fun to pull off time and time again.</p><p>This surprisingly fun gameplay loop seems to be present for each class I’ve played so far. While there are still my personal favorites, having taken some time to try out the Sorceress and Warrior at an event the next day, I think that five seconds of fun is going to be there for all the classes. I keep finding myself grinning as I learn how that introductory Skill Gem build synergizes together in a way that’s hard not to love. More generally, Grinding Gear Games confirmed that they’ve tweaked the gameplay of these introductory moments so that they’re more enjoyable for players to learn the game in the beginner areas. And I have to say that the power progression is feeling particularly great at this moment in time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And that adjustment is going to go a long way for Path of Exile 2, because the developers just revealed that couch co-op will be an option for players in the same household. I tried about an hour of this, and it definitely is going to be a big selling point for anyone in the same household who wants to jump into a game and level up together. The only slightly disorienting aspect to this was the inventory menu that takes up a large portion of the screen, so hopefully your teammate isn’t bringing it up during combat too often, but otherwise, it felt pretty seamless.</p><p>A few classes are still yet to be officially revealed, but Path of Exile 2 continues to impress me every single time I get some hands-on time with it. The Ranger demo got me to roll a Ranger in the new season of Path of Exile on PC. The Monk in Path of Exile 2 surprised me as it became very powerful so early on, and it made me want to try out all the other classes to see if I’d be surprised in the same pleasant way. Path of Exile 2 will likely have a few more pre-release reveals before launch, but I am ready to dive in right now. And based on what I’ve played over the last several months, this is shaping up to be a game you should not miss. We’ll find out for sure when Path of Exile 2 goes into closed beta later this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-branching-narrative-explained-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We are our choices. It may be a cliche, but it’s true. Our choices define us: where we go, what we do, who we meet, how we handle problems, and why we are, ultimately, who we are. Imagine all the key decisions of your life laid out before you. How many would have to change to turn you into a different person? Two? Three? Or just one, in the right place, at the right time? What choice would that be for you? And who would you have become if you’d chosen differently?</p><p>Those are the questions at the core of The Alters, a narrative survival game from 11 bit Studios, the team behind This War of Mine. In The Alters, you take on the role of Jan Dolski, a simple worker on a mining mission gone horribly wrong. Stranded and alone on a strange planet after his ship crashes, Jan must figure out a way home. But he can’t do it by himself. He’ll need the help of alters, alternative versions of himself who made different choices in life and have the skills and expertise Jan needs. But alters aren’t just another body and set of skills; they’re entirely different people with unique personalities, hopes, dreams, traumas, and ambitions. To get home, Jan will need to not only get along with his alters, but make some hard choices - and come to terms with some of the choices he made in the past.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>To better understand The Alters and how this unique set-up affects the many branching story paths you’ll encounter as you play, we sat down with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz and lead designer Rafał Włosek. The interview that follows has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>One of the most interesting things about The Alters is, well, the alters themselves, and the branching narratives that are going to come out of the possible lives of Jan Dolski, but to understand the branches, I think we have to start with the tree. Can you tell us a little about Jan, and this predicament he finds himself in?</strong></p><p><strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz:</strong> So Jan, the main character of our game, he's got many regrets in his life, and he tends to ask himself this question, “what if?” “What if I'd made some different choices in the past? Where would I be right now?” So he's using this space mining mission that he's on as a chance to put his life on a different track, but unfortunately, things go south and he ends up all alone on this distant, desolate planet where, in order to survive and go back home, he needs to face even more tough choices, including the creation of the alters. But from that point on, the decisions he will have to make are entirely up to the players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>The idea of basing The Alters on different outcomes of decisions Jan regrets is really interesting. Can you talk about where that idea came from, a few of those decisions, and the alters they lead to? Are there any decisions Jan doesn’t regret that become an integral part of the game’s story?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> When we were creating the life path of Jan and designing different decisions that shaped him into who he is in the game, we really wanted this to feel relatable. So we were gathering our own experiences internally in the team, asking ourselves, what is your what-if question, what is the thing maybe you regret in your life? And they can come from different places. It can be career-related or maybe relationship-related. Things like, “what if I didn't leave my hometown? Or what if I fought harder to save this relationship I had,” things like that. In the end, we really want every player to find something relatable to them. At least one of the choices that Jan had in his past, I hope will be something the players can relate to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We were gathering our own experiences internally in the team, asking ourselves, what is your what-if question, what is the thing maybe you regret in your life?"</p></div><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Creating alternate versions of yourself to get more manpower and access to different skillsets is a neat idea, but these are also different people with different hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets. Can you talk about how those things affect these different versions of Jan, and how they might behave as a result?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> We are bringing new alters to the base in order to solve the problems that Jan, the main Jan, wouldn't be able to solve on his own. So for example, we can bring the scientist Jan, who will be able to conduct research and create a technology that will allow us to move our base, and run away from the sun. And he solves our problem. But at the same time, we are bringing a new person to the crew with an entirely new personality. Jan's scientist is a very career-driven, ambitious alter. Soon he might start undermining our decisions as a leader. So while solving one problem, we are creating new ones. And in order to effectively manage our crew and find solutions for everything, we have to really understand who they are, what is their personality, what affects them, and successfully manage them.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Jan is obviously going to have to manage the relationships between himself and his alters, and probably going to have to intervene when problems arise. Can you talk about what that looks like? What are some of the things we’re going to have to manage here, and how do those decisions affect the outcome of the narrative?</strong></p><p><strong>Rafał Włosek:</strong> In order to get along with the alters well, we'll have to understand the emotions that they have and what people they become because of their life decisions. And the emotions are handled by a pretty sophisticated emotional system that is more complex than just they're feeling good or bad, and a single bar. And because of that, we can have emotions like frustration or rebellion. They may be amused by something or maybe stressed by something or saddened by something. And all those different emotions allow us to create different alters who act differently in different situations because then those emotions translate to the things they do. So they may rebel against the player or may help the player somehow, or maybe boost the morale of the crew. Or on the other hand, they may be so sad that they don't want to work anymore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters Screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Clearly, keeping all of these different versions of Jan happy is going to be a big challenge. What happens when some of the alters aren’t happy or don’t have a good relationship with our Jan or the other alters? Can you talk about how that affects the narrative? What about when they are happy, or we’ve managed to build a productive relationship?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> If the alters are not happy, they're angry, sad, afraid, or they're in conflict with Jan or the other alters, they may influence the game on many different levels. They may try to rebel against the player. They will lower their efficiency. They will not want to work for the mission, but they will also influence the story of themselves, of their own storylines or the stories of the other alters.</p><p>Also, there's a lot of things going on on the emergent storytelling level. So if they're in a bad shape, they may start some narrative bits that will create a different gameplay experience. But let's not forget about the fact that if the alters are in good shape and they're happy and highly motivated, they will on the other hand help the player. They will help him in achieving his goals. It'll be easier for them to fix their problems, but they can also help the other alters with fixing their problems and dealing with their past and decisions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>One of the things that fascinates me about The Alters is the base itself, and it seems the decisions you make regarding how it is managed have the potential to have just as much impact on what can happen in the story as the other Jans do. Can you talk about that, and maybe give us some examples of how the base itself plays into what happens in the story?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> Base management is very important for many aspects of the game. First, it influences the economy part. Of course, this is pretty obvious, but also has to be maintained. If you don't maintain your base well, it'll deteriorate. There will be accidents. Those accidents will create emergent stories and will influence the general alter storylines or the main story. And finally, the bigger the base is, the more rapidly we can bring back home. And this is very important for Jan, for the people back on earth. So this is another way you can influence the narrative.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Base management is very important for many aspects of the game.</p></div><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>The root of any good story is conflict, and there are a lot of conflicts in The Alters. We’ve got to manage our relationships with the other Jans and we have to manage the base, but it also seems like we’re in a race against time because of how the star that the planet we’re on orbits. Does the amount of time we spend on this world affect the ways the narrative can play out? If we progress very quickly, do we get access to branches in the story we wouldn’t otherwise see? If we’re struggling and taking a long time to make progress, do certain paths become closed to us?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> We want to spend time with our Alters. We need to invest time in our relationship because only then we will be able to uncover their stories and understand them fully, and with this crew that we understand, and that we know how to manage, we will be able to succeed in the mission.</p><p>Time is a very important resource in our game. Everything we do requires some time, whether it’s excavating the resources, or crafting stuff, or conducting the research, all of the tasks require some time. And that’s why we need the alters on board, because Jan won’t be able to make everything in time. He’s being chased by a giant rising star, so he’s got this ticking clock behind his back, but at the same time, we don’t want to rush things too much.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>In the past, you’ve said that The Alters is “using a mix of classic and emergent” narrative and reflects how splitting the life of the main character opens up new paths for the story. Can you talk more about what that means, and how we’ll see that mix in the game specifically?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> From the very beginning, we wanted to tell the story of Jan in a classic manner, but also create a game that is more open-ended and allows players more freedom in creating their own stories. So the narrative structure in our game consists of different layers. On top, we have this more classic narrative structure, which is a branching story of Jan landing on the planet and finding his way home. And it is a branching story with multiple different endings.</p><p>But underneath there is this second layer of the alter storylines, and it's up to the players what alters they create. It's not possible to have all the alters in a single playthrough. So when you replay the game, you will be able to create different alters and also within their storylines make different choices to shape their story in your own way. And underneath all of this, we have this giant layer of the emergent narrative that comes from the decisions you make. Economical decisions, strategic decisions, the way you handle your base, the way you treat your alters. It all affects them and can result in some unexpected outcomes, different reactions, different events, different mini-scenarios that can happen. In the end, we hope it all adds up to this unique experience of each player having their own unique playthrough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>You’ve talked about how The Alters is a spiritual successor to This War of Mine, which is really interesting given the drastic change in setting and genre. Can you talk about what you learned from This War of Mine, and the impact that had on The Alters in how the story plays out, or anywhere else?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> And there's also the topic of emergent gameplay. This is also something that showed up in our games for the first time in This War of Mine. In The Alters, we do the same thing. We use a lot of emergent narration, but in this game, we also connect that with a more classic approach to the narration, where we have a single storyline that is branching and we enforce this storyline with those emergent systems that make this story richer.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Is there any aspect of The Alters that players can’t see or isn’t immediately obvious that you’re particularly proud of, and hope players get something out of?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> There are a couple of mechanics in-game that I am proud of, but they're not easily visible at first glance. One of them is the emotional mechanic, which is pretty complicated. It consists of many different variables, and we don't show them as values or numbers, but more like adjectives that are floating around the alters. They have different sizes and those variables connect into even more sophisticated emotions.</p><p>And all of this makes it very hard for our analytical brain to process. But it's quite easy if you try to use your empathy to process. So the idea behind making this so complicated is not only to create different personalities for the alters that are very nuanced, but also to make the player use this proper part of the brain when they're trying to cope with alters. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The other thing would be the way we use the exploration. Of course, it is a tool to get a gameplay loop. You're going to go explore, look for the resources, go back to base, and face the problems with the alters, and so on. But it is quite important that we also wanted to use this exploration part to create a special environment for the player to actually think about all those decisions that the alters made and ultimately maybe create a space for them to think about their own decisions.</p><p><strong>IGN: What are you most excited for players to experience in The Alters? Is there anything we haven’t covered that you’d like folks to know about?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>We can’t wait for the players to meet the alters, learn their different stories, and, understand what made them who they are. In the end, we just hope that everyone will find something, and learn something about themselves through the alters.</p><p><a href="https://steam.gs/l/fi2ba/IGNFirst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> The Alters on Steam if you're interested to learn more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While this issue is potentially contributing to instability, it is not the root cause.”</p><p>Intel’s official statement references (and partially confirms) <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-comments-internally-on-the-13th-and-14th-generation-k-sku-processor-instability-issue-and-finally-brings-a-comprehensive-update-of-its-own-investigation-leak/">leaked internal Intel documents obtained by <em>Igor’s Lab </em>earlier today</a>. Those documents suggest that part of the problem is how Intel’s chips have been erroneously overclocking their own cores, using a feature called Enhanced Thermal Velocity Boost (eTVB), even when they should have known they were running too hot to do that. </p><p>“Root cause is an incorrect value in a microcode algorithm associated with the eTVB feature,” that leaked document began. It continued:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Failure Analysis (FA) of 13th and 14th Generation K SKU processors indicates a shift in minimum operating voltage on affected processors resulting from cumulative exposure to elevated core voltages. Intel® analysis has determined a confirmed contributing factor for this issue is elevated voltage input to the processor due to previous BIOS settings which allow the processor to operate at turbo frequencies and voltages even while the processor is at a high temperature.&nbsp;Previous generations of Intel® K SKU processors were less sensitive to these type of settings due to lower default operating voltage and frequency.</em></p><p><em>Intel® requests all customers to update BIOS to microcode 0x125 or later by 7/19/2024.</em></p><p><em>This microcode includes an eTVB fix for an issue which may allow the processor to enter a higher performance state even when the processor temperature has exceeded eTVB thresholds</em>.</p></blockquote></div><p>But while Intel confirms eTVB was potentially part of the problem, it’s apparently not the “root cause” of the whole issue. </p><p>Here’s hoping we get a full fix soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>With a 1990s art style and controls, Fear The Spotlight conjures the creepiness of Resident Evil and Silent Hill, but with an emphasis on the puzzles, rather than the combat.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fear-the-spotlight/" data-ref-id="5000-562985">Fear The Spotlight</a> starts like many good horror stories. A couple of friends--nerdy goody-goody Vivian and her goth pal Amy--sneak into school after-hours to perform a séance. The school has a creepy history, after all, thanks to a fire a few years earlier that claimed the lives of several students. It's a bit morbid and disrespectful to try to contact the spirits of a bunch of kids in the school library, but hey, teenagers are morbid and disrespectful.</p><p dir="ltr">I played a short demo of Fear The Spotlight at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, and at first, that was the thing that stuck with me most--at least, at first. Sneaking through the halls of the school and listening to conversations between protagonist Vivian and Amy, the whole thing felt pretty natural and realistic. Goth kid befriends nerd and the pair get into trouble together--I'm sure a lot of people have that exact backstory in their lives somewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">Fear The Spotlight matches a 1990s teen horror story with a 1990s survival-horror aesthetic. The game calls up the look of early 3D games on the original PlayStation, most notably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill/" data-ref-id="5000-1859">Silent Hill</a>. The blocky, low-resolution visuals work well with the dark high school setting, giving the whole game a strange unreality that's perfect for a ghost story.</p><p dir="ltr">The game, the product of the two-person, husband-and-wife team Cozy Game Pals, released in a previous form back in 2023. It has since been picked up for publishing by Blumhouse Games, the video game arm of movie production studio Blumhouse, and is re-releasing in Fall 2024 with additional story content. But despite having been around for nine or so months, Fear The Spotlight isn't a game I had clocked before Summer Game Fest, and after trying it for a few minutes, I was disappointed I hadn't heard of it before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319691" data-ratio="0.56145833333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319691"></a><figcaption>The library quickly becomes dark, creepy, and uncanny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo started with Vivian and Amy making their way through the halls and heading toward the library. Along the way was a quick stealth segment, in which the girls ducked under a table to avoid the scanning eye of a surveillance camera. That would be the spotlight from the title, with staying in the shadows to avoid being seen being a major gameplay element.</p><p dir="ltr">When we get to the library, we see the other major gameplay element: first-person puzzle-solving. Vivian sets off to retrieve a spirit board (otherwise known as a Ouija board), which is kept in a glass display case in the library. To get it open, Vivian needs a key from the library's office; to get into the office, she needs a keycard. Each time she interacts with one of those elements, the game cuts from a third-person perspective to first-person. You guide a cursor around a static version of the glass case to find the parts you can move or interact with. Touching the display's lock, for example, brings up Vivian's inventory to choose an item to use with it, like a key.</p><p dir="ltr">These interactive moments also give you opportunities to learn more about the world around you. Like in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-1727">Resident Evil</a> or Silent Hill, hitting the activation button on any of the other objects in the case brings up a little bit of text about them, giving some of Vivian's internal monologue about whatever she's seeing or reading. Some of these moments are pretty insightful, giving a better sense of Vivian and Amy's relationship. Fear The Spotlight seems to sport a high degree of attention to detail in providing little tidbits that enhance your understanding of the story. For instance, when Vivian retrieves the keycard from the information desk, we discover just how big a nerd Vivian really is--it's her own keycard, because she's one of the library's top student volunteers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319692" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319692"></a><figcaption>Puzzles seem like they are usually handled in first-person, where you can interact with objects.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Vivian brings the spirit board to a table where Amy is waiting, where there's another bit of first-person interactivity. When Amy passes you a book of matches, you pull a couple from your inventory and light the candles to start the séance. Placing your cursor over the planchette and holding a button down simulates the way you'd interact with the spirit board in real life, but as Amy starts to ask questions, it starts to move around the board erratically. A dark figure appears behind Amy and the candles go out, plunging the room into pitch darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">From here, Fear The Spotlight takes a drastic turn, even for such a short demo. I relight the candles slowly and painfully, dragging each one from the match box individually. When the light is finally restored, it reveals that Amy is gone. Vivian grabs a candle to light the way, and you can start to walk through the library in search of your lost friend.</p><p dir="ltr">Even in the darkness, it soon becomes clear that the library has changed. First, it's the path back the way you came, with bookshelves turned over to block the way. Then, it starts to seem like the library itself has shifted to become larger and more winding. The space itself feels too big. This is another point when the old-school PlayStation graphics amplify the weirdness of Fear the Spotlight. Checking down one pathway or another, you often see--or think you see--a figure in the darkness. Other times, you're definitely chasing Amy through the stacks, but she somehow disappears in the unnatural space. Although there are a lot of creepy things going on, according to the press materials shared for the game, the spooks you'll get from Fear The Spotlight are atmospheric--no jump scares to worry about here, if those aren't your thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319690" data-ratio="0.56229885057471" data-width="2175" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319690"></a><figcaption>You will need to sneak behind objects and under tables to avoid being seen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As Vivian calls to Amy and continues the search, a distant area of red light appears and a silhouette within it, but as we get close it vanishes, and suddenly, fire spreads through the library.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point, Fear The Spotlight is off the rails. We hurry through the library fleeing the fire, but the room has fully twisted, bookshelves and tables giving way to different walls. Red curtains hang ahead, recalling the extradimensional Red Room of the TV show Twin Peaks. As Vivian flees, the wall ahead cracks open, tearing through the memorial plaque for the students killed in the fire, creating a pathway. Vivian flees into the crack and the camera hangs back, focusing on the students' photos--the faces have shifted from smiling students to screaming demons.</p><p dir="ltr">It's there that Fear The Spotlight's demo ends, giving just enough of a sense of Fear The Spotlight to be really enticing. While it's not sporting the kind of intensity the survival-horror games it's channeling were known for, the uncanny feeling created by the game's graphical style and art direction pair perfectly with the spooky story the characters find themselves in. The demo wasn't quite enough to get a full handle on everything Fear The Spotlight has to offer, but it did leave me wanting to see more.</p><p dir="ltr">Fear The Spotlight is set for its re-release with an additional one to two hours of new content, according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959390/Fear_the_Spotlight/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, in 2024.

            <p>
Sure, everyone's excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but do you what's <em>more</em> exciting than Elden Ring's Shadow of the Ertree DLC? New hairdos, that's what! And FromSoftware is adding a bunch of them in a free update arriving next Thursday, 20th June.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like a bit of a biggie too, combining a day-one patch for Shadow of the Erdtree alongside various improvements for the base game. As detailed on Elden Ring's <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599">social media feed</a>, it brings bug fixes, balance adjustments, plus a number of new features.
</p>
<p>
With the update installed, for instance, it'll finally be possible to see all your recently acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into pile, making it a bit of a pain to figure out what, exactly, you'd just picked up); newly acquired items will be marked with an exclamation mark and a Recent Items tab has been added to the inventory.

<p>
 There are some changes to Summoning Pools too; post-update, Active Summoning Pools will carry over to NG+, and it'll be possible to enable or disable individual Summoning Pools in the newly added Map Functions menu. Only active Summoning Pools will be selected when using the Small Golden Effigy, FromSoftware notes.

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
 And finally for now, there're five new hairstyles, which can be applied during character creation, when using the Clouded Mirror Stand, or via Rennala's Rebirth feature. And apparently that's not quite everything either; FromSoftware says "other features" will be included in the update when it arrives on 20th June. That, of course, is one day ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's release on 21st June, and anticipation for its arrival remains sky high. With good reason too, if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">extremely positive early word</a> is anything to go by.

<p id="iTweao"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superhero drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Directors: </strong>Shannon Tindle, John Aoshima<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Christopher Sean, Gedde Watanabe, Tamlyn Tomita</p>
<p id="IlizaR">Ultraman is back, this time in an all-new animated feature from directors Shannon Tindle (<em>Lost Ollie</em>) and John Aoshima! <em>Ultraman: Rising</em> centers on Ken Sato, a braggadocious baseball player who returns to his home of Tokyo to inherit his father’s role as the superhero Ultraman. After inadvertently adopting a baby kaiju, Ken must raise the newborn while balancing his personal and heroic responsibilities. </p>
<p id="EP2c9z">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942014">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="GFQRMz"><em>Ultraman: Rising</em> doesn’t spend a whole lot of time on the decades-spanning mythos and world-building around the character. Instead, Tindle and company hone the film’s focus down to Ken’s family dynamic, and his subsequent arc from an obnoxiously selfish braggart to a humbler, more mature hero. That decision absolutely works to the movie’s benefit, allowing audiences who might otherwise be unfamiliar with the character to grasp the broader stakes and particularities of his universe.</p></blockquote>

<p id="TsXe3z"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 32m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Andrew McCarthy</p>
<p id="0l3i3N">In the ’80s, the young stars of John Hughes’ <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and Joel Schumacher’s <em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em> were dubbed the “Brat Pack” — much to their chagrin. Anthony Michael Hall reunites his former co-stars and colleagues to recount what it was like to come to fame in ’80s, how the intense media attention and “Brat Pack” label dogged them throughout their careers, and how they either overcame or succumbed to the pressure of their breakout.</p>

<p id="3lT6Dt"><strong>Genre:</strong> Biographical drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 21m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ava DuVernay<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga</p>
<p id="CIGxel">Ava DuVernay’s latest film is a drama based on the life of Isabel Wilkerson, the author of the 2020 book<em> Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</em>. The film follows Wilkerson’s (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) journey through Germany, India, and the United States as she researches material for her book.</p>
<p id="4rIt7j">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24043052/origin-review-ava-duvernay-isabel-wilkerson-caste">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="pJmaOP">These stories, and the context Wilkerson places them in, are powerful. The almost comical footage of Ellis-Taylor organizing piles of books, writing on a whiteboard, and tapping on a laptop while she ties her case together in voice-over adds nothing but cringe value. It’s easy to imagine a documentary version of <em>Origin</em> that’s more like <em>13th</em>, with the historical reconstructions stitched together by archive footage, talking-head interviews, and biographical information about Wilkerson. It might have been just as compelling, and much more satisfying and coherent. But the takeaway is just the same, and one I intend to act on myself: Go buy a copy of <em>Caste</em> and read it.</p></blockquote>

<p id="J04QsY"><strong>Genre:</strong> Action thriller<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 1m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Dev Patel<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dev Patel, Sharlto Copley, Pitobash</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">Dev Patel stars in his directorial debut as an unnamed street kid who, years after his village was burned to the ground, earns a living as a monkey-masked fighter in an underground boxing club. He embarks on a campaign of brutal violence to exact revenge on the men responsible.</p>
<p id="bwqMBw">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122067/monkey-man-review-dev-patel">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="QEFMgk">When <em>Monkey Man</em> finally shifts into gear for its action scenes, there’s a clearer vision at work — though perhaps “clear” isn’t the word for it. Patel, working with fight choreographer Brahim Chab and cinematographer Sharone Meir (<em>Whiplash</em>), shoots the fights up close and personal with a frenetic handheld camera that judders and whip-pans with the force of every blow, and deftly stitches these shots together into head-spinning, unbroken runs of movement. Influenced by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112377/best-korean-action-movies-watch-streaming">Korean, Indonesian, and Bollywood action movies</a>, what the style sometimes lacks in clarity it makes up in ferocity and impact. The desperation of Kid’s first bathroom battle with Rana is brilliantly conveyed (Kher is fantastic in an old-school heavy role), and the extended climax is intermittently stunning, although the editing sometimes struggles to maintain focus when things get busy.</p></blockquote>

<p id="sijoDJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Psychological horror drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 40m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Jane Schoenbrun<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Justice Smith, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Ian Foreman</p>
<p id="HCYefo">Jane Schoenbrun returns with a follow-up to their 2021 breakout <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>. Justice Smith (<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) stars in <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> as Owen, a shy student who befriends Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), an older classmate who loves a TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. As the two grow older, their relationship to one another — as well as the show itself — transforms in ways that neither could have predicted, unearthing uncomfortable truths and revelations that call into question their entire sense of identity. </p>
<p id="3fuR0R">The film’s themes and conclusion have opened up a lot of room for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166500/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-interpretations-hope-jane-schoenbrun">thoughtful discussion and speculation</a>, and Polygon got to speak to Schoenbrun about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">the origins of <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’s production</a>, as well as how <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> inspired the film’s in-universe TV series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/14/yacht-club-games-reveals-new-shovel-knight-updates-including-a-brand-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Yacht Club Games hosted its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysyNfkYWGW4">Direct-style presentation</a> today, primarily to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Shovel Knight. As such, the event featured various Shovel Knight-related announcements, including the reveal of a brand-new game.</p>

<p>This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The studio also states, “We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.”</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait to see what this new game is, but the studio did reveal an enhanced version of the original game called Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. This is essentially the definitive edition of the 2014 indie classic, featuring 20 new playable characters, a rewind function, save states, online multiplayer, cheats, and more. Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX has no release window or announced platforms. As for smaller updates, Yacht Club announced free DLC for<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shovel-knight-dig/digging-down-in-glory"> Shovel Knight Dig</a> (its final content pack) and Pocket Dungeon.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Yacht Club also provided an update for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/01/mina-the-hollower-is-shovel-knight-studio-yacht-club-games-next-project">Mina the Hollower</a>, its upcoming action-adventure game. A new trailer offers a montage of gameplay, and Yacht Club states the project is “nearing completion of the initial pass on all level content.” It plans to spend the next few months polishing and refining gameplay. Yacht Club reveals that the game has grown larger than expected since its reveal in 2022; it now features an “expansive” overworld and RPG elements. The studio says to expect a big gameplay reveal in the near future.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5MbAFiFlOA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As the life of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> goes on, the meta is going to change drastically. Things are going to get better as new enemies (and factions) are introduced. Things will also get worse. As of right now, these are the best weapons after the Viper Commandos patch in <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="93" data-injectable="false">This could drastically change as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-say-patrols-are-still-overbearing-despite-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the whole spawn fix actually made things feel a lot tougher</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-in-helldivers-2-after-the-viper-commandos-patch" data-injectable="false">The best weapons in <em>Helldivers 2</em> after the Viper Commandos patch</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">The following weapons will be displayed when fighting the current factions. Weapons will only include <strong>Primaries, Secondaries, Throwables, and Support Weapon</strong>s. Typical call-down stratagems like the Eagle 500KG, other air strikes, and turrets will not be on this list.</p> <h3 id="h-smg-72-pummeler" data-injectable="false">SMG-72 Pummeler</h3> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">If you need something fast and light, this concussive SMG can do the trick. It won’t clear waves of enemies like other weapons can, but it can soften up mobs and slow them down so you can get a chance to recover or shake them off. It pairs really well with a Ballistic Shield.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-sg-225ie-breaker-incendiary" data-injectable="false">SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary</h3> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">The Incendiary Breaker didn’t get a buff this patch, but it’s really good at clearing out smaller Terminids from close and medium ranges. Weirdly enough, it’s also one of the best weapons to take down Shriekers which have now become part of normal enemy waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-las-16-sickle" data-injectable="false">LAS-16 Sickle</h3> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The Laser Sickle is probably one of the better assault rifles now in this game because, with proper trigger discipline, you can have infinite ammo. With more small fries to kill, this will be even stronger.</p> <h3 id="h-sg-8p-punisher-plasma" data-injectable="false">SG-8P Punisher Plasma</h3> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The Punisher Plasma gun didn’t get a buff either, but it’s really good at blowing up groups of weaker enemies. Of course, with big risk comes big rewards. Shoot this too close to yourself and you’ll die.</p>
 <h3 id="h-sg-22-bushwhacker" data-injectable="false">SG-22 Bushwhacker</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">The new triple-barrel shotgun <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-all-items-in-viper-commandos-warbond-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Viper Commandos Warbond is the highlight of the set</a>. Its stopping power is great enough as a deterrent against Stalkers and medium-tier enemies. Don’t sleep on this one.</p> <h3 id="h-p-19-redeemer" data-injectable="false">P-19 Redeemer</h3> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The Redeemer pistol is still the best all-rounder for a sidearm. Whether you’re fighting the bugs or the bots, you can’t go wrong with this. It’ll save you in a pinch.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-arc-12-blitzer" data-injectable="false">Arc-12 Blitzer</h3> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">This gun may not be able to clear waves like other shotguns, but its inherent stun mechanic will be a godsend. The Blitzer can stop a Devastator in its tracks and essentially perma-stun it so that it can’t attack you. Of course, if you have many other enemies surrounding you, this won’t be as effective.</p> <h3 id="h-plas-1-scorcher" data-injectable="false">Plas-1 Scorcher</h3> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Since the R-36 Disruptor isn’t as great as it used to be, the runner-up is now the better pick. A few well-placed shots on enemy weak spots can melt them in seconds. It’s best used against the Automatons as semi-auto rifles aren’t the best in fending off the Terminids.</p>
 <h3 id="h-g-16-impact" data-injectable="false">G-16 Impact</h3> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">The Impact grenade is the perfect tool to finish off any heavy that wasn’t killed by a call-down stratagem or ordnance-type weapon. Because it’s also an explosive, it can take care of Fabricators and Terminid hives.</p> <h3 id="h-g-13-incendiary-impact" data-injectable="false">G-13 Incendiary Impact</h3> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Impact version of the Incendiary grenade is king. No fuse timer makes it exceptionally good at killing mobs of medium and small enemies. Like its normal non-incendiary counterpart, this can also destroy Fabricators and Hives.</p>
 <h3 id="h-flamethrower" data-injectable="false">Flamethrower</h3> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The Flamethrower is almost a must-have at higher-level Terminid missions. It can mow down all the small enemies and even Chargers. With Titans being your only concern, you can save other Stratagem slots to deal with them. Just, be careful not to incinerate yourself.</p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-heavy-machine-gun" data-injectable="false">Heavy Machine Gun</h3> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">Don’t mind the recoil. If you need stuff to be destroyed, the HMG is it. Yeah, the reloading can be a pain, but the amount of firepower it has is plenty.</p> <h3 id="h-spear" data-injectable="false">Spear</h3> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Gone are the days of the Railgun, but the Spear has now taken its place. With its recent tracking buffs, this thing can take down the biggest heavies in <em>Helldivers 2</em> with ease. Just make sure to keep that backpack on you.</p> <h3 id="h-quasar-cannon" data-injectable="false">Quasar Cannon</h3> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="false">Much like the spear, the Quasar Cannon is something you’ll ideally use just to take down huge enemies in one or two well-placed shots. The cooldown for each shot is 13 seconds, so make each one count.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The older I’ve gotten, the more I come to appreciate slow-paced games that encourage you to kick back for an hour or so at a time. <em>Coffee Talk</em> and <em>Donut County</em> are among my favorites in this “chill” genre. <em>SCHiM </em>may soon join them if its demo is any indication.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">I gave the <em>SCHiM </em>demo a try when I spotted it while perusing the sea of survival crafting games in Steam Next Fest, egged on by the low-key visuals and the promise of a relaxing time. In this hectic life <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and industry</a>, we can all benefit by giving ourselves an hour to unplug and unwind. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">The premise of <em>SCHiM </em>sounds like something out of Studio Ghibli or maybe Pixar. Everything, from living beings to various objects, has a “spirit” called a schim. Losing it is akin to the loss of your soul. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hop-along" data-injectable="false">Hop along</h2> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><em>SCHiM</em> starts you off teaching you how being a spirit works. Apparently, the rules on losing your schim are a bit fluid, since you can hop out of your host at will and enter other shadows so long as you eventually return. The protagonist schim in question is shown belonging to a young boy, whom you can briefly control while the schim operates in his shadow — as characterized by fantastic googly eyes. </p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Controlling the schim is a breeze. You can manipulate the spirit in various shadows as if swimming in a darkened pool. A single button tap allows you to leap from the shadow, and you make progress by entering another shadow nearby. </p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The schim can’t survive on illuminated surfaces, but you are given a short “safety hop” to make it to a shadow that was just out of your reach. Don’t worry about dying; you warp back to the nearest shadow if you mess up. You can swap the isometric camera’s angle around when you need to find another shadow just outside of your vision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Objects found in the world can help you progress. | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true">A single button press lets you interact with some objects, usually as a fun way to see how they react. You can cause a tree to shake or a child to sneeze if you hit the button while in their shadow. The moment I learned you can make bicycle bells jingle, it was over. I had to voraciously jingle every bike chime and make each duck I found quack with reckless abandon. For those desperate to know, <em>yes</em>, you can make ducks quack to the “Shave and a Haircut” jingle. No doubt 90% of everyone who plays the game will try it.</p>
 <h2 id="h-spirit-hopping" data-injectable="false">Spirit hopping</h2> <p data-characters="620" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">As suggested, <em>SCHiM </em>does have a story to share. It’s not as subtle as something like, say, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unpacking-preview-steam-next-fest-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unpacking</a></em>, where you connect the delicate threads via the environment and the objects you manipulate. The game begins with you paired with the young boy as you view his life in brief fragments. As a child, he plays without a care in the world. Time passes, and you watch him experience high school, heartache, college, and finally, early adulthood in his very own tiny cubicle in the corner of an office. Things quickly go sour for the young man and, at his lowest, he trips and gets separated from his googly-eyed spirit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">That is pretty much the crux of <em>SCHiM</em>: You’ve been separated from your human host, who is now meandering through the city oblivious to what was lost. Your goal is to give chase, navigating your way from shadow to shadow across levels with various hazards. It feels like an environmental puzzler, as you can find yourself needing to cross a street or get over a bridge by only using shadows to progress. </p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Most times, waiting for a few seconds will solve the issue with a passing human or animal. You can slip into the shadow of a cyclist or a car, which will either speed you closer to your destination if you time it right. Shadows from cars can also grab you and carry you away if you’re caught relaxing a bit too hard in the wrong spot.</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">But the game isn’t frustrating with its challenges, which is the entire point. Its one-button approach to “solving” the navigational hazards makes moving your shadow frog from one end to another a rather cordial affair. At least, that’s what I picked up from the demo. Based on the game’s description on Steam, it doesn’t sound like <em>SCHiM </em>will ultimately venture into the waters of frustration often, if at all.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-clean-styles" data-injectable="false">Clean styles</h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">It helps that the visuals are so crisp. Purposefully monotone, the game juxtaposes one color against a darker variant for texture, creating a look that’s clean and pleasing to the eye.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-big-video-game-announcements-don%E2%80%99t-hit-like-e3-used-to.902067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gears-of-war-fable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer (One Week) Of Video Games</a> has come and gone, and while companies like Microsoft brought out the big guns, it remains undeniable that Keigh-3 isn’t quite E3. What happened, though? Why does one showcase of shiny new triple-A games not feel as momentous as the other? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by some guy we know named Ethan Gach to discuss the aftermath (lol) of Summer Game Fest. Ethan was on the ground at the show in LA, so he fields questions about the experience of attending the show in person. We ultimately arrive at the same question people do after every single one of these things: Is an event like Summer Game Fest needed in a digital age where video game companies can spin up showcases whenever they want?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to our favorite games of the show, which consist of <em>Killer Bean</em>, <em>Doom</em>, and probably even a third thing. We also discuss a general feeling of malaise that hung over this year’s show. On one hand, Geoff and associated companies debuted some cool games, but it all felt so… expected. Where once the original <em>Fable </em>pioneered wild new ideas about what a game could be (even if it didn’t entirely stick the landing), the trailer for the latest installment is just a bunch of callbacks. It’s the natural endpoint of an industry obsessed with same-y safeness in pursuit of profit. Finally, we close out on a conversation about sending cats back in time, so you’ll definitely want to stick around for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can finally give the world the acorn tree-growing simulator Peter Molyneux promised us all those years ago.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> It’s funny for me seeing <em>Gears </em>in the showcase, and it being sort of a callback to that nostalgia for the characters and the series, but also what it meant when a new <em>Gears </em>came on the screen and you saw those characters. Versus now, it’s perfectly like what Luke was saying about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wolverine-crush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine looking at the photograph</a>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I guess that was my broader feeling, especially coming away from the Xbox showcase: I remember when a lot of these games and series <em>did </em>mean something. It felt so much more momentous when a new one was announced, or when one was announced at all. I mean, the whole thing about <em>Fable </em>when it was first announced was that it was this legitimate stab at something very new and ambitious. Whereas the new <em>Fable</em>, based on the trailer, feels like it’s just trying to hark back to a thing that we had before.</p><p>I guess that was sort of my bigger issue: Nothing I saw made me feel like ‘Man, those folks are just going for it’ outside a few of the indies. Most of the games just felt like another installment in whatever series. And I’m sure that they’ll be perfectly competently made – or made up to that exacting triple-A standard where each little individual portion of it is polished to a gleaming sheen, but the overall experience is like, yeah, I had a good enough time. Was it particularly memorable? Not really. But that was a fun way to kill 30-some-odd hours. I guess watching a procession of those things kind of leaves me feeling the same way I would after playing one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I’m trying to think of the other really ascendant franchises right now. Like, when CD Projekt Red is at a showcase, it’s a big deal. Maybe those sorts of things are on their off year right now. They’re out of cycle, and now it’s the bench of players who are aging out and should be just retiring. They’re trying to fill that space.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>It’s that wider sort of crisis in not just games, but a lot of cultural stuff, where they’re just so addicted to predictable, bankable IP that when you get to a show like this, it’s quite jarring when you think about how many of these games are just the sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth entry in a franchise. When you talk about how we used to find E3 more exciting, a lot of those games made their debuts during those older E3s. <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> used to be a new and exciting game series. Now it’s on its god knows what – 15th, 16th game? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Every franchise that these studios peddle out – whether it’s a direct sequel or you do the Xbox route this year where it’s a sort of rebirth or revisiting of an older series – there’s none of that excitement that, Nathan, you were talking about earlier. There’s none of those groundbreaking, mind-blowing announcements, because you associate those announcements with being a major publisher or platform holder showing off something that’s brand new but is also the centerpiece of their offering for the next year or two.&nbsp;</p><p>PlayStation didn’t get up and show a brand-new, triple-A action adventure series. They played the hits. Even <em>Astro</em>, as cool as it looked, we kind of know it’s cool because we’ve played the demo that came with the PS5. It’s not new. And all the Xbox stuff was… like I said, I like the idea of revisiting old friends, but they’re old friends. There wasn’t much brand new there either. We talked about <em>Doom </em>being the third <em>Doom </em>game. That’s not the third <em>Doom </em>game. It’s, like, the eighth game in a series that’s 35 years old or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, that’s what’s really missing. And you don’t even blame Summer Game Fest. You don’t blame individual game studios. It’s just this wider cultural malaise we’re in where all these massive, multinational companies that control our cultural content are just so addicted to the IP and the predictability that comes with IP, because that creates dependable fiscal results. We watch a show like this and get left with this feeling of ‘Eh, that was cool, but it’s not as exciting as the rush you get when it’s a cool new idea.’ A big cool idea from a big company – that’s exciting. It’s left to those indie games to fill that space, which is admirable, but they can’t do it. They fill it to some extent, but it’s just not quite the same spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> And that’s like you saw at the beginning of the Summer Game Fest showcase when Geoff was, in his attempt to sort of acknowledge the weird state of the industry right now, holding up the top ten best sellers on Steam for the year – or maybe the month. But you see the games people have gotten really excited about this year, and they’re emergent games that are out, and either there’s a demo or the full thing is there and your friends are talking about it, whether it’s <em>Hades 2</em> or <em>Helldivers 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think partly at a lot of these companies, a lot of the money has been sucked up by forever games. It might be boring to see a reveal for a new <em>Apex Legends </em>character or <em>Valorant </em>coming to console, but they don’t need to keep showing stuff for that. They’re not gonna make a sequel. They’re making hundreds of millions per year, potentially. So there’s a black hole. Where before it used to be ‘We need to get a new <em>Gears </em>out every two to three years to make money,’ now that money has all gone to <em>Fortnite</em>, and you’re kinda left with these weird moonshots every once in a while – or just falling back on the old IP stuff. So I think part of it is that the money is not there behind the types of games you used to see at showcases like this.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and on top of that, another price of the many layoffs we’ve had not just this year but also last year and other years – and also various under-the-radar cancellations; you’ll see a sentence in an article that’s like ‘They canceled two or three in-development projects’ – is that you reach a year like this and there’s nothing really, truly new to show. All that stuff got canceled years ago. That is a larger problem. If you’re smothering all your babies in the cradle, then years later, you’re only gonna have the same stuff playing on repeat forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll only be able to bring two companions with you at a time, similar to the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, and fans are worried this might affect things like party banter, which has become a staple in the series. Busche explained that lowering the party count came hand-in-hand with a desire to bring everything in gameplay to a more intimate level, and that means commanding more party actions all at once.</p><p>“We just found that when you’re playing the combat system, when you’re planning your strategies, two really felt like the right number to manage,” she said. “So keep in mind, [protagonist] Rook has a lot of different types of actions, abilities, and individual attacks that are more fully fleshed out than ever before. Timing and positioning really matter a lot, so this really felt like the right balance. The number of inputs and actions we’re asking you as a player to take, including directing your companions, is higher than ever before. [...] I engage with the companions, [and] actively control what they’re doing more than I ever have before in any of the other three games.”</p><p>As far as banter goes, Epler said that <em>The Veilguard </em>will still include banter between companions as you travel through the world, even if fewer people are taking part in the conversation at once. He also confirmed that BioWare has gone out of its way to include features like resumable banter to ensure you don’t miss a conversation by accidentally triggering an event that interrupts it. While there will be interactions between characters during your travels, BioWare also confirmed there will be banter at your home base, so you’ll still get a sense of their relationships with one another if you don’t take them out to the field.</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t think you could stop the writers from writing banter,” Epler said. “I will say for myself it’s one of the more light but fun things to do. You get to write little stories and little arcs between different characters.”</p><h2 id="h194095"><a id=""></a><strong>You can kiss a skeleton, maybe?</strong></h2><p>Since it was revealed that Emmrich, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-emmrich-volkarin-romance-1851535012">old man necromancer party member</a></span>, would have a skeletal assistant named Manfred, <em>Dragon Age </em>fans have, perhaps predictably, wondered if you can kiss the lipless man. Rhodes shot down any notion of a Manfred romance, but he seems to imply that you’ll be able to do…something….with a skeleton at some point in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“I would say, ‘not that skeleton,’ but we’re not saying ‘no skeletons,’” Rhodes responded to a fan asking to bone the bones.</p><h2 id="h194096"><a id=""></a><strong>There’s no photo mode...yet</strong></h2><p>BioWare has confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t have a photo mode, but is open to adding it. This would be the second time the studio has such a feature to its games, as it included it in the <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em> remasters, but <em>Dragon Age </em>hasn’t had one yet.</p><p>“That is a feature that we like the idea of,” Rhodes said. “It’s not just player-facing, but internally it’s a really helpful thing for us as we’re building things out to have that. So we’ll let you know.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-recommend-id="image://2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-recommend-id="image://2ea81ffaba2061c388c2496ed1a247bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A forest area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h194097"><a id=""></a><strong>The ability wheel is a bit more limited this time around</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is using an ability wheel similar to <em>Mass Effect</em>, but it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to use every spell or ability in your arsenal from this. Instead, you’ll have to assign a loadout of three abilities per character in the party, and decide what moves you want to bring with you to the field. This is similar to <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which let you learn every ability in the game but were limited to three at a time unless you swapped your loadout. Previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you access most of your spells and abilities from a similar wheel without limitation.</p><p>“What I like about this is there is kind of an emergent gameplay depending on who you and your companions are coming into the mission with,” Busche said. “The reason for that is that it actually creates a really interesting balance of strategizing [...] about your combat kit before the mission. Then the tactical decisions once you’re in the field in combat deciding what to do.”</p><p>Other ability wheel inputs will include combat-based items that can buff your team, and an “ultimate” ability depending on your class and specialization.</p><h2 id="h194098"><a id=""></a><strong>BioWare will talk about accessibility features at a later date</strong></h2><p>One fan asked if BioWare would be including accessibility features in <em>The Veilguard </em>to help players who need those play the game. The question specifically mentioned an arachnophobia mode that would remove spiders from the game, which prompted Busche to mention her own fear of spiders. However, it sounds like BioWare will give this specific topic some attention somewhere down the line before the game launches in fall.</p><p>“I do want to assure you that we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this topic so you can play the game in a way that really works for you,” Busche said. “I’m excited to share that with you when the time is right.”</p><h2 id="h194099"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Veilguard </em>takes place ten years after <em>Inquisition</em></strong></h2><p>In the original gameplay reveal, Solas mentions that he and Varric worked together as part of the Inquisition “years” ago, and now we know exactly how long ago that was. According to Epler, <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place around 10 years after the events of <em>Inquisition</em>’s final <em>Trespasser</em> DLC.</p><h2 id="h194100"><a id=""></a><strong>You’ll be able to customize your party’s outfits</strong></h2><p><em>The Veilguard </em>seems heavily influenced by <em>Dragon Age II</em> from its action-based combat to its free-for-all romance, but one thing it won’t be bringing back from the 2011 RPG is fixed party member appearances. Rhodes confirmed that while each companion will have a “wider range” of fits for you to find throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-recommend-id="image://132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-recommend-id="image://132da5dca5abbc111e8123c7b115eeb4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cast of Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h194101"><a id=""></a><strong>The team is not focused on DLC at this time</strong></h2><p>Most of BioWare’s recent games (with the unfortunate exception of<em> Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>) have had major story DLCs. Busche said that right now ,the team’s entire focus is on the main <em>Veilguard</em> game and didn’t confirm or deny if the team would work on DLC after launch. She did, however, reiterate that it won’t have any microtransactions, battle passes, or online requirements.</p><h2 id="h194102"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be transmog</strong></h2><p>Busche confirmed that <em>The Veilguard </em>will have a transmog system so you can wear whatever you want while keeping the stats of stronger equipment.</p><h2 id="h194103"><a id=""></a><strong>There won’t be any asexual characters this time around</strong></h2><p>A fan asked if any characters in <em>The Veilguard </em>will be on the ace spectrum, and Busche said that while none of the companions will be asexual, she, as a gray asexual person, would like to include one down the line.</p><p>“None of our companions this time around are explicitly ace. When we look at the characters, their motivations, who they are, we always assess, ‘is this the right time?’ This time it wasn’t. But what I will say, for everyone on the ace spectrum out there, I would love to represent an ace relationship sometime in the future when it feels like the most authentic fit for a companion, when we can do it best.”</p><h2 id="h194104"><a id=""></a><strong>Blood mage will not be a specialization for Rook</strong></h2><p>While Busche didn’t specifically mention the other mage companions, she did confirm that Rook will have plot reasons for not practicing the controversial Blood Magic in <em>The Veilguard</em>. She didn’t get into specifics but did confirm that necromancy, elemental magic, and a more combat-based specialization are all on the table.</p><h2 id="h194105"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be no dog this time</strong></h2><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>had a canine companion in your party. That will not be the case in <em>The Veilguard </em>because the game takes place in northern Thedas, where the Mabari breed isn’t prominent. You can, however, pet Assan, Davrin’s griffon companion.</p><h2 id="h194106"><a id=""></a><strong>BioWare will show the character creator before launch</strong></h2><p>Having seen the character creator at Summer Game Fest, I can confirm <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator is easily the deepest one BioWare’s ever done. Busche confirmed BioWare will show it off publicly before launch in the fall.</p><h2 id="h194107"><a id=""></a><strong>Rook’s last name will be defined by their faction</strong></h2><p>Because you can play as so many different races in <em>Dragon Age</em>, player characters’ last names were often determined by race or backstory. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, Rook’s last name will be defined by which of the six factions you choose for them. Their first name will be customizable, however.</p><h2 id="h194108"><a id=""></a><strong>There will be a collector’s edition</strong></h2><p>While BioWare wasn’t able to talk about the different editions for <em>The Veilguard</em>, Epler said the team would talk about those “soon.”</p><figure id="" data-id="2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-recommend-id="image://2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-recommend-id="image://2022f2e79563b1fcccd764a57c9e5ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A beach area in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h194109"><a id=""></a><strong>Tavern songs are back</strong></h2><p>One of the coolest worldbuilding bits in <em>Inquisition</em> were tavern songs performed by bards in Skyhold. Those will be returning in <em>The Veilguard</em>.

It sounds like <em>The Veilguard </em>will have similar falling-outs, but it seems like some of them might not be permanent.</p><p>“You can piss them off, they might not agree with you, and they might take some time away,” she said. “That said, this is the biggest threat to Thedas we’ve ever seen, so they are always going to be willing to show up to defend Thedas, but yeah, you can piss them off and they’ll leave for a minute.”</p><h2 id="h194111"><a id=""></a><strong>If Rook dies, game over</strong></h2><p>In previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games, you’d shift control from one character to another if they died in combat. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll have to reload a save if Rook dies. That’s because you don’t get direct control of your companions this time around, but you can spec a party member to revive you to salvage a bad fight.</p><h2 id="h194112"><a id=""></a><strong>The Fade decision from <em>Inquisition </em>won’t be a factor in <em>The Veilguard</em></strong></h2><p>In <em>Inquisition </em>you had to choose between leaving either <em>Dragon Age II</em> protagonist Hawke or a Grey Warden leader in The Fade to help save the team from an ugly spider demon. Epler confirmed that this choice won’t play into <em>The Veilguard</em>’s story, but did say it might come up in a future game down the line.</p><h2 id="h194113"><a id=""></a><strong>There won’t be mounts this time around</strong></h2><p>Because <em>The Veilguard </em>isn’t open-world like <em>Inquisition</em>, you won’t be riding a horse in the new game. Rhodes explained mounts were meant to address a need that the studio no longer has this time around.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming this fall, so if you’ve not played these games before, you still have some time to catch up.

                <p dir="ltr">It's been a long time coming, but Slitterhead finally has a release date. The survival horror game will launch on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">November 8</a>--and for those eager to secure their copy early, preorders are available now. At the moment, you can only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder the game for PS5 at Amazon</a>, but you will get several physical collectibles with your preorder. Plus, unlike many current-gen games, Slitterhead is only $60. We'll update this article with more preorder listings when they are available.</p><p>Slitterhead is the latest game from Keiichiro Toyama, creator of the Silent Hill series, and will be the first title from his new development company, Bokeh Game Studio. Slitterhead was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-creator-reveals-slitterhead-a-new-survival-horror-game/1100-6498857/" data-ref-id="1100-6498857">first revealed</a> in 2021, and since then, it has been one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2024-and-beyond/2900-5020/" data-ref-id="2900-5020">the most-anticipated upcoming horror games</a> despite knowing very little about it simply because of the pedigree of its development team.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Slitterheard Preorder Bonuses</h2><p dir="ltr">Slitterhead has a Day 1 physical edition that comes with some cool bonus content. You'll get the official soundtrack on CD, a 100-plus page art book, a sticker sheet, and a custom box. The Day 1 edition is only available while supplies last. These sorts of editions with free content often sell out prior to launch, so we'd recommend locking in your preorder if you're interested in Slitterhead</p><div title="6524038 - slitterhead preorder guide" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2432" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6524038 - slitterhead preorder guide" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Slitterhead Day 1 Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6XGQMQ9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>It's worth noting that Amazon currently has the incorrect release date listed for Slitterhead.

The trailer showed players wielding melee weapons, guns, and supernatural powers against grotesque monsters stalking neon-soaked city streets. The fast, dodge- and parry-focused combat is certainly a different direction from what Toyama took with the Silent Hill games, but the dark tone and unsettling creature designs are appropriately horrific.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still a lot more we don't know about Slitterhead, but with only a few months left before launch, fans won't be waiting much longer. Slitterhead launches on November 8 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.

			<p>Wolfenstein developer MachineGames is known for their solid writing and penchant for diabolical nazi villains, which is probably what got them the gig making <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but they also just know how to make a good shooter. The Wolfenstein games deliver a lot of guns-blazing, gory action, so will their Indiana Jones game be the same?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. While being interviewed on the Official Xbox Podcast, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle director Jerk Gustafsson explained the goal is to make a “proper adventure game” that targets a “wider audience” than their previous hardcore shooters. As such, more often than not stealth and puzzle solving will be the best route forward, and when you do run afoul of the bad guys, you’ll frequently be punching them out instead of shooting them down.</p>
<p><em>“We're used to having these heavy weapons, gun-blazing shooters. This is a little big different. We are making a proper adventure game here, and it's also a game that is a little more directed at toward a wider audience, [which is] a bit of a new thing for us. </em></p>
<p><em>We prioritized that we had to stay true to Indy's personality, and who he is above all. He is a normal human being. He is not this caped superhero. He is flawed, he makes mistakes, he stumbles. There is weight to his movement and we have this gritty pulp edge to the action. But, at the same time, he's also rather athletic, he's an excellent fighter, and he has an enormous amount of luck as well. </em></p>
<p><em>It is something that we've been focused on a lot when it comes to gameplay. [Indy] solves problems with his mind first and really relies on smarts, not this excessive combat that we've seen or done before in the Wolfenstein games. So, when you are playing the game, choosing the more authentic stealth route, or just some classic fist fighting, will be a benefit to the player and, more times than not, also make for a very fun and challenging experience.”</em></p>
<p>The full Official Xbox Podcast interview is worth checking out, as the MachineGames guys get into a variety of topics, including the game’s locations (Marshall College, the Himalayas, Egypt, Thailand, the Vatican, and “a couple” of other locations), and the fact there will be a “couple” classic character cameos we haven’t seen yet. They also touch on the work they’ve done with Lucasfilm to ensure the game’s authenticity, Troy Baker’s work as Indy, and more. You can check it all out, below.</p>

  <p id="DgF39t"><small>This review of </small><small><em>The Imaginary </em></small><small>is timed to the film’s festival premiere at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival. The film will stream on Netflix in America starting on July 5.</small></p>
<p id="dW9XlZ">When Studio Ponoc’s first anime feature, <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, premiered in 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16358234/mary-and-the-witchs-flower-movie-review-anime-studio-ghibli-ponoc">it came as a relief</a> — a promise that the legacy of Japan’s famed animation powerhouse Studio Ghibli wouldn’t be entirely lost with Ghibli’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/4/5966439/studio-ghibli-shutting-down-restructuring-ni-no-kuni">rumored plans to shut down</a>. Founded by Ghibli veteran Yoshiaki Nishimura (producer of <em>When Marnie Was There</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275363/isao-takahata-studio-ghibli-animation-innovation-japanese-art-princess-kaguya"><em>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</em></a>), and taking on former Ghibli employees in an attempt to preserve their experience and skills for future animated projects, Ponoc came into the world openly billed as Ghibli’s successor. <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em> was so clearly modeled on Ghibli designs and storytelling that the transition seemed fait accompli.</p>
<p id="0znUkE">But Ghibli stayed in business, with co-founder Hayao Miyazaki laboring away on another animated feature, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797923/how-do-you-live-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-review"><em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a>, while his son Goro experimented with digital animation to make the television movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22258621/earwig-and-the-witch-review-studio-ghibli"><em>Earwig and the Witch</em></a>. And Ponoc’s output has been slow over the past seven years, with no new feature films — just the charming shorts collection <em>Modest Heroes</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22590291/olympics-2021-anime-studio-ponoc-short-tomorrows-leaves">some lovely promotional projects</a>. So its new feature <em>The Imaginary</em> is a second round of relief for animation fans — both because the company is still in the moviemaking business, and because <em>The Imaginary</em> sees it just starting to edge away from outright Ghibli mimicry. (And, as a side note, because 2024 has been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177114/the-imaginary-netflix-release-date-studio-ponoc">a terrible year for cinematic imaginary friends</a> so far.)</p>

<p id="RpL5Uq"><em>The Imaginary </em>just debuted at France’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and comes to Netflix July 5 via an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24049777/studio-ponoc-the-imaginary-netflix-release-date">exclusive distribution deal</a>. Adapted from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-F-Harrold/dp/0802738117?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23942729__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">2014 novel by British author A.F. Harrold</a>, the film follows a spunky young girl named Amanda and her imaginary friend Rudger. (Not “Roger,” she and Rudger keep indignantly reminding people, but <em>Rudger</em>, which in Netflix’s dub and the kids’ posh British accents is pronounced pretty much the same way.) Rudger is a little blond boy who joins Amanda on all her imaginary adventures, and seems to regard her more like a playmate than a creator, though it’s notable that she occasionally treats him like a favored toy — something respected and beloved, but still capable of being banged about a bit for excitement and drama. </p>
<p id="2mtzNT">Amanda’s father has recently died, and while her mother, Elizabeth, has struggled to keep the family bookstore open, she’s ready to shut it down and move on to a more secure line of work. Elizabeth seems like a kind woman who’s a bit at the end of her rope, trying to deal with grief, a failing business, and a hyper kid who leaves messes behind because she has her head in the clouds, then blames them on her imaginary friend. Their dynamic feels notably like the <a href="https://screenrant.com/calvin-and-hobbes-mom-biggest-freakouts/">frustrated family energy</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/5/13/21254476/calvin-and-hobbes-comic-strips-books-quarantine"><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em></a>: Elizabeth wants Amanda to pick up after herself and pay attention to her surroundings, while Amanda is distracted by the elaborate, adventurous worlds she’s creating. But where Hobbes’ relationship with Calvin’s mother mostly comes down to a minor frustration that she doesn’t make tuna fish sandwiches more often, Rudger has more melancholy longings. He thinks of Elizabeth as his mother, too, and wishes she could see and acknowledge him. </p>

</p>
<p id="tLbM7I">There’s a lot more <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> energy at play in <em>The Imaginary</em>: Like Bill Watterson’s comic-strip duo, Amanda and Rudger climb into a box and it suddenly becomes a vehicle flying through the air as the real world falls away. The games they play together are more real to them than anything else in the world, and their partnership is more vivid and crucial than Amanda’s other friendships.</p>
<p id="xe6aHf">The movie’s most exciting, most visually exalted sequences come whenever the story enters the imagination realm, where form is fleeting and fluid. People, objects, and settings all transform on a whim, and the possibilities seem limitless. Ghibli animator Yoshiyuki Momose (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie"><em>Spirited Away</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/29/21275119/porco-rosso-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-ending"><em>Porco Rosso</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/28/21273717/take-me-home-country-roads-song-movies-studio-ghibli-whisper-of-the-heart"><em>Whisper of the Heart</em></a>) directs the film with the kind of dedication to shape-shifting and symbolic shifting <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/832-the-gross-fluids-and-clean-fluidity-of-spirited-aw/">Hayao Miyazaki brings to his best movies</a>. (<em>Millennium Actress</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24173761/scavengers-reign-influences-inspirations-more-like-shows-miyazaki"><em>Paprika</em></a>, and <em>Perfect Blue</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/30/20836173/perfect-blue-satoshi-kon-explained">Satoshi Kon</a> made a similar fluidity of form a signature in his movies, but usually with a conscious aggression and sense of nightmare threat instead of Miyazaki’s and Momose’s expression of bouncy joy.)</p>
<p id="NafmE4">But where Miyazaki movies <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21269323/castle-in-the-sky-studio-ghibli-movies-hayao-miyazaki-villains-explained">generally avoid outright villains</a>, <em>The Imaginary</em> has a particularly compelling and present threat. There are plenty of Miyazaki-style emotional stakes as well — Rudger, like other imaginary friends, is in danger of fading away if Amanda isn’t focused on him, and he gets to see firsthand what happens to “imaginaries” whose children die, grow up, or move on. But <em>The Imaginary</em> compounds the danger with an actual villain, who’s better discovered than described, and who brings an old-school sense of gleeful, gloating wrongdoing to the movie, alongside all its sunny explorations of children’s adventures in the worlds they create.</p>

<p id="ZztERr"><em>The Imaginary</em>’s animation still shows plenty of Ghibli influence, from the overstuffed, painterly rooms packed with gleamingly detailed objects to the way characters cry, with rivers of outsized, glutinous tears pumping down their faces in messy rivers. In close-ups, when experiencing big emotions, Amanda and Rudger look very much like off-brand Ghibli characters, just a touch off-model. But Ponoc’s film is edging toward its own look as well — a softer, more painterly color scheme, thinner lines and flatter colors, and character designs a little closer to Toho-Towa’s 1989 international release <em>Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</em> than to any specific Ghibli movie.</p>
<p id="5XGmQq">And Ponoc’s film also feels like it’s aimed more firmly at younger viewers than most of Ghibli’s work. The screen is frequently filled with high-energy bustle, as Rudger meets an entire colony of displaced Imaginaries or the story heads inside a different kid’s imagination. But the story itself is fairly simple and straightforward, exploring feelings of pain, loss, and fear in the Pixar mode. There are a couple of authentically scary moments, but mostly, the film keeps a kid-forward outlook, where children face the perils and solve the problems adults are oblivious to, and playtime frequently takes center stage.</p>
<p id="t9BrTu"><em>The Imaginary</em> isn’t as visually or narratively rich as <em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em>, or as transcendent as Miyazaki projects like <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>. But it does feel like a move in the right direction for Ponoc, an effort at finding its own voice and its own footing. It may not be remembered decades from now with the same fond fervor as Ghibli’s early projects, but if Ponoc keeps experimenting and keeps branching out, it might well be remembered as the first step toward forming its own distinctive creative legacy, and stepping out from under Ghibli’s shadow. In the meantime, it’s a giddily thrilling experience for young anime fans, a movie aimed at visualizing what it feels like to daydream as a kid, to enter a world of absolute imagination where everything else falls away. </p>

<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players have successfully rescued a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-latest-mo-forcing-players-to-choose-between-anti-tank-mines-and-saving-sick-kids-is-going-as-well-as-you-imagine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital full of sick children</a>, rather than unlocking a mine Stratagem. Wow, after typing that out, it really wasn’t much of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfspv6/isnt_that_sweet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moral dilemma</a> after all. Arrowhead is celebrating by donating to charity, while hinting that players can still earn the mines. </p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">The donation news reached divers <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801603873502638151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via a message</a> dropped by CCO Johan Pilestedt on X. Following the liberation of Vernen Wells, Arrowhead Games donated $4,311 to Save the Children. </p> <figure data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">For those wondering, 4,311 looks like “HELL” when punched into a calculator. It’s also the number of kids rescued from the in-game hospital. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The donation to Save the Children was warmly embraced by many members of the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, some of whom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfs2ln/operation_save_the_children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also donated</a> to the foundation not long after hearing the notice. Another member suggested a new cape to celebrate the victory. I have to put my vote in for the one below, for hitting me right in the nostalgia.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-players-get-one-more-shot-at-earning-the-mines-stratagem" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players get one more shot at earning the mines Stratagem</h2> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Even though <em>Helldivers 2</em> players opted to save Vernen Wells over Marfark, the Major Order still has less than a day before ending — as of this writing. When asked, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilestedt confirmed</a> that players can still earn the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem so long as they can liberate Marfark in the small window of time. Apparently, the game’s DM Joel said “they never will,” which sounds to me like a challenge.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You will!</p><p>Joel said.

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="false">I have a feeling that if players fail to earn the Stratagem again, it probably won’t be the last it gets dangled in their faces. At this point, divers unable to unlock the Anti-Tank Mines have become something of an inside joke, possibly to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfttao/well_unlock_them_eventually/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chagrin of the devs</a> who worked on the Stratagem. There’s always next time. Maybe.</p>

It claims those disputes will be processed by Asus’ own staff rather than outsourced customer support agents.</p><div><p>And, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">failing to even acknowledge the ROG Ally handheld’s SD card reader issues</a> for over a year, the company will be finally be issuing a formal statement about the defect next week, <em>Gamers Nexus</em> is reporting.</p></div><p>One month ago, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7pMrssIrKcY"><em>GN </em>revealed</a> that Asus could in some instances charge customers for unwanted and unneeded repairs, among other issues.

ASUS has promised us an email this month with other changes.</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunds of service charges for unnecessary repairs which customers felt compelled to accept in order to have a warranted repair covered, such as unrelated or misclassified CID [Customer Induced Damage]</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding shipping charges in scenarios where a warranted repair was part of the RMA. For clarity, if a customer has both an out-of-warranty repair and an in-warranty repair in the same claim, shipping will be covered by ASUS</p><p>ASUS has committed to refunding labor and taxes related to these aforementioned qualifying disputes</p><p>ASUS has created a Task Force team to retroactively go back through a long history of customer surveys that were negative to try and fix the issues</p><p>ASUS has removed the power from the repair centers to claim CID. Now, CID claims must go through ASUS’ team. This will remove some of the financial incentive to fail devices. There still is one, but now it won’t be motivated as much by speed</p><p>ASUS is creating a new support center in the US. This will enable customers to choose between a repair of their board or a faster swap with a refurbished board. This solves an issue where refurbs were the only option in some scenarios previously</p><p>After over a year of refusing to acknowledge the microSD card reader failures on the ROG Ally, ASUS will be posting a formal statement next week about the defect, resulting from this series</p><p>ASUS will publish a more transparent repair report template in September of 2024</p><p>ASUS is changing the Advance RMA language to reduce emphasis on physical damage</p></blockquote></div><p>Also, here’s an email template you can use when emailing that executivecare@asus.com address, as provided by Asus itself:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Your Name (as listed in your RMA):&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>RMA Number:</em></p><p><em>Serial Number:</em></p><p><em>RMA application country:</em></p><p><em>Please describe your previous RMA dispute:</em></p><p><em>Supporting Documents (e.g., charged invoice, quotation notification, photos):</em></p><p><em>Additional Feedback (optional):</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Asus says it should respond to emails sent to that address within a week. </p><p>The company is also apologizing today for previous experiences you might have had with repairs. “We’re very sorry to anyone who has had a negative experience with our service team. We appreciate your feedback and giving us a chance to make amends.”</p><p><em>Gamers Nexus</em> says it’s not taking Asus at its word. “[W]e already have devices in their RMA centers under pseudonyms and plan to continue sampling them over the next 6-12 months so we can ensure these are permanent improvements,” writes editor-in-chief Steve Burke.</p><p>Asus had previously laid out a handful of promised customer support improvements <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fus%2Fsite%2Fsupportupdates">at this link</a> (pdf).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Yacht Club Games just announced a new mainline game in the hit series that started as a retro-inspired 2D platformer, and the studio says this new game will “launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming,” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough of a clue about the move to 3D, the Yacht Club Games’ Friday livestream celebrating the 10th anniversary of <em>Shovel Knight</em> featured an even more pointed hint: a 3D version of the Yacht Club Games logo.</p><p>The studio is staying mum about many specifics — there’s no release window — but did tease that “the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a <em>Shovel Knight</em> title.” </p><p>While you wait for that new game, Yacht Club Games will have a lot of new things you can play. The studio also <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-shovel-of-hope-dx-announcement/">announced <em>Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</em></a>, the “definitive edition” of the original <em>Shovel Knight</em> title that adds things like online multiplayer, stereoscopic 3D, a rewind power, in-game cheats, and the ability to play as 20 different Shovel Knight characters. Yacht Club Games says the game is “coming soon.” <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-dig-wicked-wishes-launches-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Dig</em></a> and <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-pocket-dungeon-paradox-pack-releases-summer-2024/"><em>Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon</em></a> are also getting free DLC this summer. </p><p>The developer also shared <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db5MbAFiFlOA">new footage of <em>Mina the Hollower</em></a>, its upcoming game that looks to be heavily inspired by the Game Boy classic <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Mina</em> also has a vague “coming soon” launch date, and I look forward to a more specific release window — the game looks fantastic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s estimated that the value of all the games is around 70,000 yuan or about $9,660 USD. </p><p>In China, Article 7 of the Regulations on the Implementation of Customs Administrative Punishments of the People’s Republic of China prohibits people from evading customs by “hiding, disguising, concealing declarations, false declarations or other means, transporting, carrying, or mailing goods that are prohibited or restricted from entry or exit by the state.” And like in most countries, bringing in goods without paying the necessary taxes is illegal and considered smuggling. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://english.customs.gov.cn/statics/4440eff0-0440-4876-8f8a-9c8f16be4355.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://english.customs.gov.cn/statics/4440eff0-0440-4876-8f8a-9c8f16be4355.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As pointed out by<em> Tom’s Hardware</em></a></span>, assuming the Switch carts aren’t considered “restricted” by China, the woman suspected of smuggling games in her bra is unlikely to see jail time. Instead, she could be fined “not more than three times the amount of duties payable but evaded.” </p><p>Now, for folks out there who wear or have access to bras, and also a bunch of Switch games, here’s my challenge to you: Try to fit 350 Switch carts into some lingerie. I’m guessing this isn’t an easy feat. Just getting them all in there to begin with sounds hard enough. And then you have to carry all that weight and plastic on your chest while trying to look normal. I’m not sure I could do it. And I guess neither could the woman caught by Chinese officials. </p><p><strong> .</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">A lot has changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>. Among some of the changes that will affect your game as you grind toward high-level content is how Exotic armors are divvied out going forward. The old way of unlocking new Exotics, by playing through Lost Sectors, is over. Instead, you'll need to earn reputation with Rahool, the Tower Cryptarch, if you want access to those spiffy new armor pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's a quick rundown of how Exotic armor works now, how things have changed, and what it'll take to rank up with Rahool enough to get access to his new wares.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Out_With_The_Lost_Sectors">Out With The Lost Sectors</h2><p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 has added a lot of new Exotic armors over the last few years, and The Final Shape has two new armor pieces for each character class. You can earn one of them by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-campaign-missions-list-and-how-long-to-beat/1100-6524012/" data-ref-id="1100-6524012">completing The Final Shape's Legend campaign</a>, but the other will remain locked until you either complete the campaign again, or gain access to a new brand of Exotic focusing: Tier 3 focusing.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, to gain new Exotic armor, the trick was to complete the daily, rotating Lost Sector on Legend or Master difficulty. Each day featured a different kind of armor, so if you were missing an Exotic helmet from your collection, you'd wait for the head armor day to come around and play through the Lost Sector until you got the helmet you wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">From now on, though, that method is over--while the daily Legend/Master Lost Sector still rotates around the map, it no longer drops a specific type of Exotic armor. You can still play Legend and Master Lost Sectors to earn high-end materials and Exotic engrams, but you won't earn any specific Exotic armor from them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Rahool_For_All_your_Exotic_Armor">Visit Rahool For All your Exotic Armor</h2><p dir="ltr">Instead, apart from what you get from the campaign or specific Exotic missions, all new Exotic armor pieces go through Rahool. He's the guy who decrypts Exotic and Prime Engrams for you in the Tower. Rahool now has a reputation system, so the more Engrams you decode, the more points you get, unlocking rewards along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Rahool also offered "Focusing" services that let you pick what piece of Exotic armor you would get out of an Exotic Engram. You had three options: You could decrypt the Exotic Engram normally and get a random piece of armor at no cost other than spending the Engram; you could focus the decryption on a specific expansion or seasonal release to narrow the random pool down to just a few Exotic armors, but at a cost of Glimmer and Enhancement Prisms (called Tier 1 Focusing); or you could pick the specific piece of armor you wanted, if you were willing to pay more Glimmer and Ascendant Shards (called Tier 2 Focusing).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319626"></a><figcaption>Tier 3 Focused Decoding, otherwise called Novel Decryption, lets you buy any Exotic armor in the game as long as you have an Engram and an Exotic Cipher.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319626-20240614124628_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With The Final Shape, Rahool adds Tier 3 Focusing, which allows you to buy "novel" pieces of Exotic armor to add to your Collections tab. These will cost you one Exotic Engram as well as an Exotic Cipher, which you can earn from ranking up with Rahool or from Xur when he shows up each weekend. Xur will offer you an Exotic Cipher quest so you can earn one each week, and you'll get another for resetting his reputation rank. There are also a small number of Exotic Ciphers available as rank rewards on the Season Pass. You can hold up to five in your inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">All that said, you don't start with access to Tier 3 Focusing--you have to reach Rank 17 with Rahool in order to unlock it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Increase_Your_Cryptarch_Rank">How To Increase Your Cryptarch Rank</h2><p dir="ltr">This part's easy, although it can be either time-consuming or expensive. To increase your rank with Rahool, all you need to do is decrypt Engrams. The more specific your decryption, the more reputation points you earn for each one, so Tier 2 decryption gets you the most points (500), Tier 1 decryption gets you a little less, decrypting an Exotic Engram drops it even more, and decrypting a Prime Engram gets you the least.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to rank up quickly, then, you should knock out some Tier 2 Focusing decryptions. These can get expensive in a hurry, but they will rank you up <em>fast</em>--many of the Cryptarch ranks are only a few hundred points, and even at the top end, ranks cost around 800 points, so you can climb this in minutes if you have materials and Engrams stockpiled.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you reach the top of the reputation ranks for Rahool, Tier 3 Focusing unlocks for all your characters, and you no longer have to worry about it. You'll now be able to purchase new Exotic armors, including the ones from The Final Shape's Legend campaign, as long as you have Engrams and Exotic Ciphers.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape guides hub</a> for many more answers about what's new in Destiny 2, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a> while you're at it.</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Back in 2021, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> held a Japan exclusive promotion with Lawson, allowing players to get their hands on a rather porky mount in exchange for purchasing products from Lawson grocery stores. Now, the Porxie King mount will be available to everyone, in exchange for some tea.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">If you live anywhere near a Gong cha, you might want to head out and purchase some tea or waffles between July 17 and August 28. In exchange for purchasing three items from the special <em>FFXIV </em>themed menu in one transaction, you’ll be able to get your hands on the until-now elusive Porxie King mount.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">He’ll be sort of familiar to anyone who has ventured into Il Mheg, as we’ve come face to face with another Porxie, Mother Porxie, during Matoya’s Relict. The little pig comes complete with a small crown atop his porky head and huge ears, which presumably help him when it comes to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-ffxiv-aether-curren-locations-by-expansion-map-and-compass/">flying</a> us around any map.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">It’s nice to see previously region locked items being put up for grabs by those who couldn’t previously get their hands on them. Coming from someone in the EU, I’m <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-players-left-feeling-excluded-by-region-locked-mountain-dew-promo/">happy to wait</a> for items as long as I have some hope of eventually getting them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="false">Sadly, the nearest Gong cha to me is 50 miles away which is far from ideal, but I will be hopping on a train to get some tea. And I don’t even like tea, so if anyone is in Nottingham and wants free tea, hit me up.</p>
