<p>Because over the last few years, they’ve made three separate titles in a newly minted, old-school RPG franchise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and then there’s the upcoming Switch 2 release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, the defacto RPG game that caused a brand distinction between Nintendo and Sony nearly three decades ago.</p>
<p>And now, we are getting a remastered release of 1997’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, a game certainly among the most cherished releases within Square’s original canon. This is starting to feel like a <em>thing</em>.</p>
<p>In promotion of Ivalice Chronicles' upcoming release, the game’s director, <strong>Kazutoyo Maehiro</strong>, and art director, <strong>Hiroshi Minagawa</strong>, sat down with Nintendo Life and discussed returning to Final Fantasy Tactics and all its heavy themes, why this version differs from the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions">War of the Lions</a> re-release on the PSP a decade and a half ago, and where they see old-school RPGs as a genre fitting in within Square Enix as a whole.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Alan Lopez for Nintendo Life: The original Tactics came out in 1997, around the same window of time as FFVII, and I find that footnote really interesting. It was kind of a historical fork in the road between the…classic RPG turn-based style, versus [games] aspiring for more cinematic, action-based graphics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Similarly interesting to me, the remake of Tactics is coming out in 2025, a time within the broader RPG [genre] when there’s been a sort of resurgence towards more “classic-style”, turn-based games: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, the renaissance of the Fire Emblem franchise, etc. So my first question is, why did you decide to bring back Final Fantasy Tactics now, and what does this style of gameplay mean to both of you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kazutoyo Maehiro (Game Director):</strong> So it just so happens that a few years ago, both of us had the chance to [re]play the original Final Fantasy Tactics. And I think through playing the original once again, we were able to reaffirm just how great the overall game design and story were. You know, it’s been almost 30 years since the original has come out, and there’s a ton of fans who have loved this game over the years, but we really haven’t had the chance up until now to put out any kind of remaster.</p>
<p>Through playing the game, we realised how great the story and the game was, and we just kind of had the feeling that we really wanted to bring that to players in the modern age. It’s been almost 30 years…there are a ton of fans of the game, but there are also a lot of people who have heard about the game but had never had the chance to play it. I think part of the overall vision of this project was to bring this game to those people as well.</p>
<p><strong>I just played the demo before this interview and was reminded that the game features a lot of themes that are almost closer to historical fiction…I mean, I don’t claim to be encyclopedic about every Final Fantasy ever released, but [Tactics] feels more grounded in reality in its story to me. The theme of the demo [</strong><strong><em>Note: we played an early battle in which you discover a party member has switched allegiances for higher pay</em></strong><strong>] was a classic conflict between</strong> <strong><em>class</em></strong><strong>, not identity. I’m curious if there was any conscious decision to re-release Tactics today in light of those ideas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Whether you played the original Final Fantasy Tactics as it came out 28 years ago, or you’re playing The Ivalice Chronicles, which has a lot of script updates and edits from [series writer Yasumi Matsuno], I feel like a lot of the social aspects in the game’s story are still relevant today.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it really was a matter of [any] situation now that we’re putting it out, but [rather], I think it’s more the fact that the story still resonates, even so much later, and that’s the amazing part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Hiroshi Minagawa (Art Director):</strong> You know, this is something that Yasumi Matsuno himself has been sharing during some of the interviews that I’ve had an opportunity to also be a part of. We really feel like the social aspects of what’s being discussed and grappled with in this game as they pertain to the world still definitely haven’t changed fundamentally over the past 28 years. I feel especially when playing the game, some of those themes will definitely resonate with players. That’s something that I strongly feel.</p>

<p><strong>I want to talk a little bit about the Classic and Remastered modes</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you go online, people are</strong> <strong><em>so</em></strong> <strong>opinionated about [video game remakes] that change anything, or maybe not changing enough. And it’s an interesting thing with the medium of games, because in other mediums, you’ve got your Spielbergs and your Lucases who will never hear the end of [it for] changing something. But in games, there’s this cultural willingness to do quality of life updates, or updating things for new hardware…so I’m curious how you personally balanced the reverence for this game…with making big changes like, for example, the addition of voice acting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> I think it’s kind of like what you said… maybe I’m kind of the same, but when you go back and play older games, the bigger a fan you are of the game, the more averse you are to making changes. But at the same time, you think about the 28 years since the original has come out, and the different platforms that have come out, and we see a lot of advances in the overall way that interface and controls have been set up. One of our goals with The Ivalace Chronicles was to bring in new players who haven’t been able to play Tactics yet. I think with that in mind, it was a <em>must</em> for us to update the UI and controls to make it more of a modern experience. That’s why we have all of that packed into the enhanced version of the game.</p>
<p>But as I was mentioning, there are people who are fans that might just want to play the original version of the game as they remember it. That’s why we ended up putting the classic version of the game in there. It might not be standard practice to put in two different versions of a game, but we ended up going with that with that thought process in mind.</p>
<p><strong>But you still ultimately end up being the arbiter of preservation. So, for example, there are people who are upset that the updates from the PSP version of the game are not included, while others love your changes and think it’s more approachable. I’m curious [if you view] your role as a sort of preservationist…did you feel the weight of how this game will be remembered?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> [For me], I was actually involved with the graphics side of things, that was my main jurisdiction. And when it came to the classic version of the game, because the approach was to recreate the original version of the experience as faithfully as possible, in a way it was really quite straightforward what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the question of '<em>How much</em> do we really want to push things and change things up?' was something that we really needed to figure out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when it came to the enhanced version of the game, the question of '<em>How much</em> do we really want to push things and change things up?' was something that we really needed to figure out. Making those early decisions was certainly a very critical point of discussion for us.</p>
<p>One way to think about this, since I was one of the people involved in the development of the original game, I mean, if I had made the decision that we should drastically change the graphics for this iteration, you know, I’m sure my team would have followed suit with that. But ultimately where we landed was that we wanted to take the style from back then and really try to modernise it for today’s audience with modern platforms.</p>
<p>And there’s kind of two reasons for this. The first was, because I was involved with the development of the original game, the memories I had for what it was like working with the development team members at that time [and knowing] what thoughts went behind why we created the original game was something that had a very special place in my heart, emotionally. This was my first project I was involved with when I joined the company. Because of those things, I really wanted to be able to bring back that style from back then and try to bring new life to it for modern consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> I think if we switched gears and talk about this from a game perspective, specifically the PSP version The War of the Lions... when that came out [in 2007], there were other [Square titles] that came out around that time, so we added in characters for that — we added Balthier from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_xii_the_zodiac_age">FFXII</a>, Luso from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a> — for myself, thinking about the time during which that game came out, and the content that was in there, (those choices) made a lot of sense, and made a complete package for that version of the game.</p>
<p>But I think if we look at the strategy RPG genre as a whole (which I myself am a big fan of), once you get into it, sure, you realise how much fun it is, but the truth of the matter is that it’s really a little bit of a niche genre overall. So when we thought about it, for this version of the game in particular, we were trying to take the original version and give it a sort of “rebirth”...[and] one of the goals that we had for [The Ivalice Chronicles] was to expand the genre! So we felt by taking the content from the original and putting it back to the way it was, we could hopefully achieve that goal.</p>

<p><strong>How involved were you with the casting of the voices? [In playing the demo] I had the feeling of when you watch a movie based on a book you’ve read and you’re like, “Oh my god,</strong> <strong><em>that’s</em></strong> <strong>what Ramza has sounded like this whole time?” [laughter] I thought the voice acting was very good! I’m a notorious dialogue skipper, yet I didn’t want to skip any of the dialogue because the voices were so interesting to me. So I’m curious how close you were to the vetting of their voices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> First of all, I’m so happy that you liked the voices so much. [laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Me too! [laughter]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> As you were saying, it’s been a really long time since the original came out, and I think over time the fans have developed in their heads for themselves what maybe the characters sound like. I think with that in mind, it’s difficult to match what everybody thinks these characters sound like. But in order to not stray too far from what [we believe] people think they should sound like, we kept [the fans] in mind when we went through the whole selection process.</p>
<p>We also worked very closely with Yasumi Matsuno (original writer/director of Final Fantasy Tactics), and with him we tried to figure out what voices would match what players might think these characters would sound like. I think overall, we were really able to get some good selections for both the English and Japanese voices that really added to the feeling and drama of the overall story.</p>
<p><strong>Was there any debate internally over the voices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Mmmmm, to be honest, not really! When it came to the casting part, we had the support of Matsuno-san, and with his support, the whole process went really smoothly. And I think the same can be said for the recordings. We actually had the help from the same team that did the voice recordings for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, so I think with that experience, it was an overall smooth process. But it’s not even just the dialogue scenes, we had all the battle scenes that we had to record as well. And even when it came to those, we had a really good process overall.</p>
<p><strong>Is it true that the original source code for Final Fantasy Tactics was lost?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> Technically speaking, yes. And I think it has a lot to do with how games were made back in the day. Back in the day when we were making the original game, we didn’t really have the resource management tools that we have now. [Takes his hands and slowly alternates stacking them onto each other.] We’d make the Japanese version of the game, then we’d go on to make the English version of the game, which after we’d make that, we’d essentially just overwrite the original version to make the new one… and we’d just keep overwriting and overwriting. So that “original” version doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’d just keep overwriting and overwriting. So that “original” version doesn’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically what we had to do today was use any resources available to us, whether that be the retail version of the original game, or the master disc that we had in our archives, the smartphone version… we basically took these different versions, analysed them, and tried to build up what we felt was the “original” version.</p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> And speaking to the graphics side of things, typically during game development, you receive bug tickets to address. And during the development [of The Ivalice Chronicles], there were some issues that would come up that have actually existed since the original game. [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>What is it like to art direct that, when you’re trying to emulate something by remaking it by eye, almost? What does that do to the creative process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> Well, to first speak about how the process was like for the original game’s development, when it came to the character artwork and designs, Akihiko Yoshida [former Square art director] would be the one to make the artwork itself, and from there, I would be the one who would think about how to capture that artwork and display it on the screen.</p>
<p>When it came to the PS1 version, of course some of the technical specs of that platform were much lower, so the question I had to ask myself was, 'How can I take this world that Akihiko Yoshida is trying to make and really try to capture that and bring it out into the actual in-game environment?' If I were to have [directed] things in a straightforward manner, it might not [have been the same].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Which parts should I hold myself back?' That was the biggest challenge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, with the enhanced version of Ivalice Chronicles, now the technical specs of the hardware have increased exponentially. So if there were things that we wanted to do, we [could] do it, but if we were to do them, it kind of undermines some of the balance we wanted to be able to strike with trying to maintain the atmosphere of the original game. The biggest challenge in this new context was…walking that fine line between what I want to pursue versus 'Which parts should I hold myself back?' That was the biggest challenge I had.</p>
<p>To give just one example, we were of course designing things practically, keeping in mind people playing the game on the Switch, on a handheld device, while there will also be people playing this on a TV screen, like this giant one behind us. Ultimately, the graphical expression needs to be the same across both of those environments, but if we were to keep one in mind more than the other, then it would [negatively impact] the other one. We had to think around that by adding things like filters, and display things in an easier-to-see manner. How to really optimise every visual display, I really had to think through.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, we’re being called on for the final question now… kind of returning to the question from the top, Square has in recent years been releasing more classic-style RPG titles, like this Tactics remake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">Triangle Strategy</a>, Octopath Traveler, and others. So in light of this [development] experience, I’m curious how you personally would like to see these types of games evolve — a genre you called “niche”, and what many might even call “pure”? Do you both view games like</strong> <strong>Tactics a</strong><strong>s an “other” thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maehiro:</strong> So for The Ivalice Chronicles, we’re releasing it as that “classic” game experience, but of course within Square Enix we have other games, such as the Final Fantasy VII remake series, which has the latest end specs. From my perspective, it’s not really one or the other that’s the right choice, [but] in tandem, they progress together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel as though [Square Enix fosters] an environment where we, on the ground level, if we want to pursue this type of an idea for a game, we’re in an environment that allows us to pursue that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the [advancement] of gaming platforms, there’s a lot more expression you can put out in games, whether that’s a classic style game or a AAA style game, it can be either. What we want to be able to deliver to players is <em>either</em> of those experiences. I think what we’re able to do at this point for players…is really about providing both of those experiences, so players can choose what <em>they</em> want.</p>
<p><strong>Minagawa:</strong> This is one of those things where people might have different feelings about what they think about Square Enix as a company, overall. But at least for me, I feel as though [they’ve fostered] an environment where we, on the ground level, if we want to pursue this type of an idea for a game, we’re in an environment that allows us to pursue that. And both Maehiro and I were involved in Final Fantasy XVI prior to our involvement [with] this project, and [that] was definitely more of a “higher end” experience.</p>
<p>But then right afterwards, we wanted to pursue a project like this one, and we were allowed to pursue this as well. So rather than the company dictating what it is that we should do, I feel like, especially since we ourselves are players, if there’s something that we are interested in, they’ve allowed us to pursue that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> launched back in May to positive reviews from fans and critics. But like with most Ubisoft games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-free-updates-assassins-creed-shadows-road-map-1851778558"><em>Shadows</em> has continued to be updated over time</a>. And tomorrow’s big 1.1.1 update is its biggest yet, making it the best time to return to the game’s gorgeous digital recreation of Japan.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv">On September 10, Ubisoft released the full patch notes for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> update 1.1.1</a>, which is arriving on all platforms on Thursday. This is a massive update. The big star of this new patch is that it adds support for the game’s first major DLC expansion: <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. This DLC is launching on September 16 and will be available to anyone who pre-ordered <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> ahead of its launch earlier this year. It will also be sold separately. The upcoming expansion adds a whole new region to the already massive in-game world of <em>Shadows</em>, as well as around 10 hours of story content, missions, and activities.</p> <p><em>Claws of Awaji</em> adds a new weapon type for Naoe, one of the game’s two playable characters, to use: The fast and hard-hitting bo staff. But you don’t need to buy the DLC to get this new weapon. Ubisoft has changed plans and announced on Wednesday that all players will get access to a bo staff after completing a new free quest being added in update 1.1.1.</p>

 <p>“Originally developed exclusively for the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> expansion, we thought this weapon was way too cool not to share with everyone… for FREE,” explained Ubisoft in the patch notes post for 1.1.1. “You get a Bo! And you! And you at the back! Everyone gets a Bo, coming September 16<sup>th</sup>.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, update 1.1.1 also adds a ton of free stuff that will be available on September 11. For starters, Ubisoft is increasing the level cap (again) and now you’ll be able to level up to 100, letting players get even more powerful. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328">Your in-game hideout is also getting some new features and upgrades</a>. Here’s what Ubisoft had to say about the new hideout changes:</p> <blockquote><p>With the new update, each unique building now includes 2 additional upgrade levels, bringing a total of 20 new enhancements, alongside 3 new Hideout levels. These upgrades introduce valuable bonuses that accelerate Hideout growth, improve crafting capability by making Gold more accessible, and directly enhance Naoe, Yasuke, and their allies, making them more effective in both combat and exploration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will also get two new gear levels: Mythic and Artifact. Ubisoft makes it sound like upgrading weapons and armor to these new levels will take some time, and that it’s mainly an option for players who are playing on new game+ and need extra help against the tougher enemies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what you need to know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is officially<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-global-release-times-confirmed"> releasing on September 12</a> for <em>most </em>platforms. The exception to that is the Switch 2 edition that won't arrive until later in October. It's one of the most anticipated games of 2025 and fans of the Borderlands series have been eagerly awaiting its arrival since it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">first announced last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the release date upon us, however, you may be wondering if it's actually worth preordering the game now or waiting. I've played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-games-in-order">every mainline Borderlands game</a> with my dad over the years, so this is a question that I'm especially interested in. My dad has informed me that he's planning on preordering the Super Deluxe Edition of the game purely for the added DLC, but I'm thinking I'll probably wait a bit longer to see if I can get a discount later down the line. There's a lot to consider, but to start here's a quick rundown of the main editions you can preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Preorders - What Comes With Each Edition</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are really only two editions of the game worth preordering. There's the standard edition, which comes with the base game <em>and</em> a preorder bonus as well as the super deluxe version, which comes with a bunch of extras as well. Here's a quick breakdown of each:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Standard Edition</h3><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of the game is exactly what it sounds like. It's the base game for whatever platform you choose. If you decide to preorder it ahead of release, you will get a preorder bonus called the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/gilded-glory-pack/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilded Glory Pack</a>. This includes a Vault Hunter Skin, a Weapon Skin, and an Echo 4 Drone Skin. Beyond that you will get your copy of the game on day one and will be able to play it right away.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Deluxe Edition</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223087"><div id="223087" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The super deluxe edition of the game is almost double the cost of the base game. It includes the full base game, the Firehawk's Fury Weapons Skin, the Ornate Order Pack, the Bounty Pack Bundle, the Vault Hunter Pack, and the preorder bonus Gilded Glory Pack. The main reason to get this edition, however, is for the additional DLC content and playable characters that come with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-bounty-pack-bundle/9MWDKHJH6G7B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bounty Pack Bundle</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-vault-hunter-pack/9PG964GJNRF8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault Hunter Pack</a>. These two add-ons include new areas, missions, bosses, regions to explore, and two additional playable characters that don't come with the base game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Actually Worth a Preorder?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're on the fence about deciding whether or not it's worth preordering, I'd say it really comes down to whether or not you're willing to pay full price for the game, whether or not you care about the preorder bonus, and whether or not you care about playing the game on day one. It's unlikely that the price of the game is going to really drop until next year, so if you <em>do</em> really want to dive into it on day one then there's really no reason not to grab a preorder now. The bonus you get is just some additional skins and weapons, so if you don't care about that the real benefit is getting your copy as soon as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like with any AAA title, however, it's worth noting that there will likely be bugs you'll be contending with in the early days of gameplay. Randy Pitchford has already made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-day-1-patch-does-a-lot-randy-pitchford-says-but-dont-expect-miracles-from-older-pc-hardware">comments about the day 1 patch</a> you'll have to download once you actually have the game, and it's highly likely even more patches will come. So if you want the best possible gameplay experience, it's probably worth waiting a bit until all of the kinks are worked out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I plan on waiting until the game gets discounted simply because I can't stand paying the full price for any video game anymore. I'm definitely excited to play co-op with my dad, but since he's retired he'll blow through the whole thing on his own multiple times before I'm actually going to be ready to jump in there with him so there's no rush for me to buy now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">No one can accuse <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> of being a short game, or lacking more reasons to stick around after its main campaign wraps up. Ubisoft itself recommends you set aside 60 hours to reach its end credits, which eventually roll after you complete missions meant to cap off the personal journeys of its dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. Six months after launch, my save file is now north of 100 hours, as I continue to explore further untouched corners of its map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, Shadows' story still feels incomplete. When those credits eventually do roll, several key story threads remain unresolved, such as the location and true status of Naoe's monther, as well as the last of three mysterious boxes — the hunt for which drives much of the game's plot. Yasuke, meanwhile, declares his mission to hunt down Templars is only just beginning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's something of an odd note for a finale — but then, with the 10-hour Claws of Awaji expansion set to continue the story (and release free for those who pre-ordered Shadows, as an apology for the game's delay), it's clear that Shadows' end wasn't really the finale of its story at all. Assassin's Creed games have long had DLC to continue the adventures of its heroes, but never before has an expansion been so closely tied to the story of its base game, something which should make Claws of Awaji feel more essential, while also upping the pressure on its makers to ensure it delivers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Claws of Awaji is the work of Ubisoft Bordeaux, the team behind the enjoyable but inessential Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC Curse of the Druids that went on to lead the well-received Assassin's Creed Mirage. In a recent visit to the studio, I sat down with Claws of Awaji content director Simon Arsenault to find out how his team worked closely with Shadows' lead studio Ubisoft Quebec to continue Naoe's story and deliver "proper closure" to fans awaiting answers at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we started, we pitched a couple of ideas," Arsenault said. "Eventually we met with Quebec. They had thought of stuff before because they've been working on the project like two or three years before we jumped in. But that doesn't mean that they wanted to realize it — it was just an idea. Everyone can have ideas — that's kind of the easy part. You come up with an idea and then you trash it. That's easy. But trying to kind of act on it and figure out every detail of it, that's where the real craftsmanship is. So they had thought of stuff, but they weren't necessarily attached to everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Ubisoft Quebec] already had some backstories prepared for Naoe's mother and how she and [Naoe's father Fujibayashi] Nagato had met, for example. So it was kind of easy to grapple those ideas and say 'Okay, how can we make it? Well, she was the first Japanese-born Assassin. Cool. How does that translate in their relationship?'"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling too much of Shadow's introduction, it's safe to say that Naoe heads to the game's new island of Awaji after being given strong reason to believe her mother Tsuyu is being held captive there. Upon arrival, Naoe then uncovers the truth about Tsyu's status — and hears word of that final mystery box — which sets her off on the expansion's main adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main game didn't have as much personal relationship," Arsenault says, discussing the scenes scattered throughout Claws of Awaji where Naoe learns more about her family. "[There's] a lot at the beginning with Nagato, a little bit with Tomiko, with Junjiro for sure. But the ending, we couldn't necessarily have a relationship. The mother is still not there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So [we said] 'let's bring in something personal to that character' — and it was also helpful to have it [set] after," Aresnault continued, referencing the fact that Claws of Awaji is chronologically set firmly as a coda to the main game, and cannot be played until after the credits have rolled. "And for Yasuke as well — if we had done it somewhere else in the story, well, Yasuke wouldn't have finished his own storyline, so he had not even talked to Naoe about his own mother."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Bordeaux wasn't necessarily always set to make this story, Arsenault revealed. Claws of Awaji's focus on the mysteries of Naoe's mother, and that third box, were both part of the discussions the studio had with Quebec as development began. For example, Bordeaux knew the expansion would introduce a new weapon to the game, but which it would be was not set in stone. (It's the Bo Staff, which all players will receive free whether they own Claws of Awaji or not.) As for Naoe's mother, did Bordeaux "have to make an expansion about her specifically?" Arsenault questioned. "Maybe not."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also sounds like there was some flux within Shadows' main storyline as development on it, and Claws of Awaji, both progressed. Fans have long wondered about Shadow's main macguffins, the three boxes ultimately said to contain the Japanese Imperial Regalia. Was it always the case that only two would be found in the main game, with a third left for the expansion?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It happened very fast," Aresnault replied. "It happened very fast, as soon as we started talking. If I remember correctly, because the game was still moving at that time, there was only one box total in the game, so we didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes. So they were still competing their own game. That's when we started talking about closing a little bit, the arc of the Regalia, that's when we started [saying], 'okay, well maybe we can bring in another box.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Bordeaux also decided to feature the returning character of Hattori Hanzo in Claws of Awaji as well, Arsenault continued. "That's when Hanzo came in, so yeah, it's a back and forth. Since the expansion is released kind of close to the release of the main game, both of them have to be produced at the same time in the timeline. Otherwise you don't ship this amount of content with this amount of quality."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this talk about Naoe's personal story, I was curious how Claws of Awaji would feature Yasuke. "So we focus his story more on — he still has a Templar hunt ongoing," Arsenault said, "but he's more in as a support role to Naoe emotionally at this point. He's kind of helping her go through what she's living." Where Naoe and Yasuke often had their own journeys in Shadows, they are "on one path together" in Claws of Awaji, Arsenault continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a story so closely tied into that of the base game, Claws of Awaji is being positioned as an experience that Assassin's Creed fans will want to return for. And after that — once my save file has reached at least 110 hours — will Bordeaux's expansion now provide a final finale? Or has it been tasked with passing Shadows' story baton on to yet anoher team?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying to make a closure for now, give Naoe a closure for her personal story," Arsenault concluded. "You can always reopen things, we've seen TV shows do it, we've seen movies do it. It's easy to do. So there's nothing closing the door completely. But we can expect at least to have proper closure to Naoe's story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the expansion, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-knows-youve-already-played-100-hours-of-assassins-creed-shadows-but-hopes-you-return-for-claws-of-awaji-to-play-the-expansions-cool-metal-gear-solid-inspired-stealth-boss-fight">IGN's report on Claws of Awaji's Metal Gear Solid-inspired stealth boss fight</a>, and Arsenault's thoughts on keeping players entertained with fresh ideas, even 100 hours of gameplay later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Modern sci-fi survival-horror games owe a lot to Alien, as decades after it was first released, Ridley Scott's film is still seen as the benchmark for cosmic terror. Naturally, we've seen the franchise adapted into several video games, and if Dead Space creator Glen Schofield were given the chance to put his own spin on the series, he'd do it--if he had complete creative freedom to do so.</p><p>"Let's say I took on a license," Schofield said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/the-creator-of-dead-space-would-love-to-make-an-alien-game/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>. "Which I really don't want to do--I want to make my own. Let's say somebody came to me and said, 'We're going to give you the Alien license.' Immediately, I could show you, I don't know, maybe 100 different aliens I've made in Midjourney over the last two years, just because I like it. So yeah, I would love to make an Alien game. I have to own the creative. That's not even negotiable.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ports-of-every-re-engine-resident-evil-game-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1293978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Capcom leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412">Dusk Golem</a>, not only is <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-gen/">Resident Evil Requiem releasing on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Capcom has plans to port ever Resident Evil game it has made using its RE Engine to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In response to someone asking Dusk Golem about the ports, they clarify that they're not talking about every Resident Evil game having a Cloud version playable on Switch 2, but a proper native port. Nintendo Switch players will have to remain satisfied with Cloud versions, though, or upgrade to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</em>"</p>



<p>As this exchange happened before today's news about a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/"> Nintendo Direct being confirmed</a>, Dusk Golem continues to say that, "<em>There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well. There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least <a href="https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz">https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dusk Golem adds that they don't know when each of the games will arrive, or if it's a surefire conclusion that Resident Evil VII: Biohazard will show up at this week's Nintendo Direct, just that they "<em>have heard very reliably several times now they're all coming to Switch 2 sooner or later, &amp; that does include Requiem (so RE7, RE:2, RE:3, Village, RE:4, Requiem)</em>."</p>



<p>The current library of Resident Evil games on Nintendo platforms includes classic ports of RE 0, Resident Evil, RE 4, RE 5, RE Revelations, RE Revelations 2, and RE 6. RE VII: Biohazard, RE 2 Remake, RE 3 Remake, and RE Village are all only available through Cloud versions. </p>



<p>If we get an announcement for RE VII: Biohazard on Switch 2 this coming Friday, then it will be at least one game Dusk Golem is right about, meaning they could be right about the rest. We'll see what Friday has in store.</p>

Only the rustic brown color is seeing the discount to $95, with all other models costing at least $127.</p><p>The Claiks Electric Standing Desk offers a load capacity of 176 pounds, is adjustable from 28.3 inches to 46.5 inches, and offers a quiet 45dB operating noise. You can even save your favorite heights to three buttons on its control panel, allowing you to quickly go from sitting to standing without difficulty. You'll find hooks off both sides of the desk for easy headphone and backpack storage, while its sturdy metal legs should keep it stable regardless of height. For $95, that's an impressive list of features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer\/dp\/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">ErGear Electric Standing Desk (47")</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer\/dp\/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $140)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While the Claiks Electric Standing Desk is cheaper, this one from ErGear is also worth considering.

For one, this is a standard black design, with a black surface and legs giving it a more minimalistic feel--compared to the rustic aesthetic of the desk above. It also features four programmable height buttons, giving you one more slot for your most-used settings. Beyond that, these two budget-friendly standing desks are quite similar, so be sure to check them both out before making a purchase.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-special-edition-arcade-machines-cheapest-standing-cabinet-2025/1100-6534472/">Check Out Arcade1Up's Budget-Friendly Mortal Kombat And Pac-Man Arcade Cabinets At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-6-film-steelbook-library-4k-blu-ray-collection-in-stock-at-walmart-september-9/1100-6530389/">James Bond 6-Film Steelbook Library 4K Blu-Ray Collection In Stock At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-bricktember-exclusive-lego-bundle-deals-september-2025/1100-6534392/">Walmart Has Exclusive Lego Bundles This Month: Spider-Man, Star Wars, Disney, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-tactical-edition-free-dlc-collectors-edition-restock-buying-guide/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Solid Delta Collector's Edition Restocked At Amazon (September 2)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Controller For Switch 2 Gets First Price Cut, But It Won't Be Available For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">All Zelda And Street Fighter Switch 2 Amiibo Are On Sale For $20</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart/1100-6534223/">Preorder The Shining Film Vault Special Edition At Walmart Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discontinued-arcade1up-countercade-randomly-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6534222/">Discontinued Arcade1Up Countercade Randomly Restocked At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fall is nearly here. People around my place are putting up Halloween decorations already. I’m leaving my windows open and going outside more. But I’ll try to stay in and enjoy some of the new games being added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog this month, like <em>The Invincible </em>and <em>Persona 5 Tactica.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On September 10, PlayStation officially announced</a> the next round of PS Plus Extra and Premium games that will be added to the subscription service’s game catalog. All of these newly revealed games will be available to start downloading and playing on September 16.</p> <p>I’m really happy to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em> on here. This indie lo-fi retro survival horror game</a> caught my attention last year when it launched, but I never got around to playing it because there were (and still are) too many damn games. That made me sad, but now that it’s waiting for me on my PS5 as we enter Spooky Season, I’m going to try and play it. Another horror game included here, <em>Conscript</em>, also seems like a perfect Halloween game. Heck, even<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance, </em>this month’s classic game<em>,</em> has some creepy, gothic horror vibes, too.&nbsp; If PlayStation is giving out two horror games in September, I’m hopeful that next month’s offerings will include even more spooky titles!</p>

 <p>Remember, to access, download, and play these games, you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber. Essential tier subscribers don’t get access to the game catalog. And if your subscription runs out in the future, you’ll no longer be able to play these games.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>WWE 2K25</em> – PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Persona 5 Tactica </em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Green Hell&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Fate/Samurai Remnant&nbsp;</em>– PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Crow Country – </em>PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Invincible – </em>PS5</li> <li><em>Conscript –&nbsp;</em>PS5</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium Only</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance –&nbsp;</em>PS5, PS4</li> </ul>

                <p>Rougelike deckbuilders aren't exactly a rarity, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike/" data-ref-id="5000-644496">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>, due out in November, is far from typical for the genre--in this game, you'll be able to build your own manga fight scenes.</p><p>The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike is an adaptation of sorts of Katsuhisa Minami's The Fable series, which follows a hitman known as "The Fable" as he tries to lie low and live a normal life for a year. That, predictably, doesn't go exactly as planned.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R397YlcIggo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R397YlcIggo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Given the popularity of Sega's Like A Dragon series (formerly known as Yakuza in the West), a franchise also focused on a former Japanese mobster who gets pulled back into a life of crime, The Fable does seem ripe for a video game adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">However, this is far from a straight adaptation. Featuring actual panels from the manga, the game instead uses The Fable's striking action panels like a deck of cards. To battle, players place an assortment of manga panels, each with properties like attack, defense, and move, into a certain order before watching a battle unfold according to the panels played.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be three characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, that players can use to create scenes. Series protagonist Akira is a highly skilled hitman capable of dealing damage up close and from a distance with firearms. His sister Yoko can surprise enemies with ambushes, while the hitman Suzuki specializes in traps and debuffs. Over time, players can upgrade their manga deck to make certain panels even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a challenge can take on the game's Puzzle Mode featuring one-page battle challenges, or play through scenes from the original manga reimagined as minigames.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not only will fans of the series enjoy it, but even those unfamiliar with the series can feel the same tension and ingenuity of battles that the manga delivers," developer Mono said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Kodansha, which is also publishing The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike, began releasing English volumes of The Fable in 2024. The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike launches on PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch on November 5.</p>

<figure><a title="Pikmin" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f52e354378f9/pikmin.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Motoi Okamoto, a former developer at Nintendo and now steward for the <strong>Silent Hill</strong> franchise at Konami, has taken to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/at-nintendo-every-developer-is-a-director-if-you-make-excuses-you-get-removed-from-the-team-motoi-okamoto-says/">social media</a> to comment on whether game directors might be considered "incompetent" if they're unable to judge new ideas without first implementing them.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1964258913957925205">Automaton</a>, Okamoto – who worked on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_play">Wii Play</a> – describes a culture at Nintendo in which "everyone is a director", thus giving team members the agency to make decisions that might improve a game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0qliysz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>He also says that implementing ideas and playtesting them is crucial to making a solid, fun product. As such, programmers who make excuses for not doing this – whether it be due to deadlines or monetary reasons – will be "removed from development teams without hesitation".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’ve been seeing some takes along the lines of, ‘Can’t you tell whether a game specification is good or bad without implementing?’ and ‘Directors who can’t judge without implementation are incompetent.’ But at Nintendo, implementing and playtesting is precisely what matters – they don’t make decisions based on what they see on paper.</p>
<p>"Programmers who are lazy about implementing things, and project managers and programmers who try to avoid the trial-and-error process using deadlines and budget restraints as an excuse are removed from development teams without hesitation.</p>
<p>"If a programmer finds a spec boring, they’re free to just implement it in a way they believe will make it entertaining. That’s what professional game programmers do. It's a culture where everyone is a director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He follows up by saying that Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata, who are considered to be "sages" within the industry, maintained a very hands-on approach when it came to developing games, concluding that it's "plain arrogance" for some to make judgements without testing new ideas.</p>
<p>It's an interesting glimpse into the development culture at Nintendo, although it's worth considering that things might have changed slightly since Okamoto left. Still, ensuring new ideas are tested thoroughly to analyse their validity is a solid way to work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Chief Rebel and Arc Games announced a slight delay to the early access launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fellowship</a>, the 'multiplayer online dungeon adventure game'. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-early-access-release-date-october-open-beta-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously set for October 9</a>, but it'll now be available on Steam starting on October 16.</p>



<p>In the video below, Community Director Hamish Bode explained: </p>



<p><em>We made the decision recently to push back that early access date just a week. It's not a huge change, and I know that we all want to get in and play the game as soon as possible, but hopefully we can hold out just one more week. There are a couple of big reasons why we decided to do that. One, it gives the team a bunch more opportunities to implement all of the polish that they want to do. We've been privately play testing the game as you know, and we've made some pretty giant changes to the game that we really want to make sure are completely nailed down before we open the floodgates of early access. But there is a really big elephant in the room and we've always made the promise that we'll be as transparent with you as we can absolutely be. And that week is absolutely stacked with games, right? You've got things like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 launching</a>. I know people are looking at Legion Remix as well. It's just kind of a smart decision for us to push a week and give Fellowship the best possibility of getting recognized and hopefully getting the attention that I think we all agree that it deserves.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Fellowship Open Beta test will kick off on Steam on Thursday, September 18 and end on Tuesday, September 23. The servers will open and close at 10 AM Pacific Time. Supported regions include North America, Europe, and Asia. Players will be able to experience seven heroes, including two tanks, three DPS, and two healers. They can go on dungeon runs, both ranked and quick play, and take on challenging enemies to acquire epic loot. Compared to the Steam Next Fest demo from February, the Open Beta will introduce new gameplay systems, including a fresh take on matchmaking and group finding and an engaging progression system with weapons, gems, talents, crafting, legendary items, and more. </p>



<p>The Open Beta will also introduce a new dungeon, Urrak Markets, and new gameplay features, such as cosmetic customization. There will also be new gear, new mounts, and visual element improvements, as well as improvements to previous gameplay mechanics based on Steam Next Fest player feedback. Lastly, it will be a chance for the development team to test the improvements made to multiplayer matchmaking before the early access release.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-wwe-2k25-persona-5-tactica-green-hell-fate-samurai-remnant-and-more/">announced</a> the games getting added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for September 2025, which include titles like Green Hell, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>



<p>If you are subscribed to the top-tier Premium level of PlayStation Plus, then you'll have eight new games to check out between both the PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium Classic's game catalogs. If you just have the middle-level PlayStation Plus Extra subscription, then you're getting seven new games in total.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">Last month's additions</a> included games like Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, along with a brand-new release of Sword and the Sea, which launched into the service. By comparison, this month is definitely far more hampered down, featuring four fewer titles and no brand-new launches.</p>



<p>Beyond the aforementioned titles, other notable inclusions for this month are the indie darling Crow's Country, the survival horror game Conscript, and The Invincible. The game getting added to the PS Plus Premium Classic's catalog this month is Legacy of Kain: Defiance.</p>

The bar for getting me to write up a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> has never been higher. I don't care how many twists you throw into the formula, developers. I don't care how imaginatively you have reinvented the wheel of permadeath and unlocks. I am tired of this genre/wantonly adhesive cultural phenomenon. I wish for it to die in shame and ignominy.</p>
<p>You've made a roguelike in which attacks are performed by assembling a manga page, you say? Well... go on then. Here's a trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>.

"Each turn, you receive new panels," developers Mono Entertainment <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187880/_Manga_Build_Roguelike/">explain on Steam</a>. "Placing them on the page creates your action sequence. Place panels according to the situation, build the ultimate page, and defeat your enemies!"</p>
<p>Taking damage tears holes in the paper, and you can't plug manga scenes into holes, so you'll ideally nobble all your enemies in a single turn, before they strike back. It would be lovely if the pages you assemble made sense and flowed properly as in an actual manga - it looks like there's some repetition, going by the trailer.
</p><p>
How do you unlock new varieties of panel for combat? By means of, amongst other things, "surreal little mini-game events", such as barbecuing fish and confronting bears, possibly because the bears are trying to eat your fish. There are three characters who together form a Streets Of Ragey ensemble. Akira is a hitman who likes guns and punching. Yoko is good at mobile attacks - behold her teleporting in the trailer. And Suzuki is some other kind of assassin who can lay traps.
</p>
<p>
There's a puzzle mode which gives you a limited selection of panels with which to complete an encounter, and a bonus mode in which Yoko and some "playboy" called Yuki have a drinking competition. I cannot read the Japanese dialogue in the gifs, so I can't currently give you any sense of whether Yuki is a massive creep, but odds seem fair.
</p>
<p>Some additional background: Mono Entertainment were founded by a New York University design graduate, and are also the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393890/IGNISTONE/">Ignistone</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812120/Clock_Rogue/">Clock Rogue</a>. "The Fable" is an actual manga series published by Kodansha, with millions of readers: it's about a super-assassin capable of killing anybody in six seconds, who is trying to live a normal life at his boss's instruction.</p>
<p>
I've just realised that this is one of those dang deckbuilders as well - the manga panels are effectively cards, innit. Those fiends! They snuck that one right by me. Anyway, this one's launching on 5th November, and there's a demo on the way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m always saying that Raichu, the evolution of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>constant target of disrespect</span></a><span> from both The Pokémon Company and the community at large. Well, now some collectors with far more expendable cash than I’ll ever fathom are in a high-stakes bidding war to buy one of the electric mouse’s rarest cards. The fabled “Prerelease Raichu” card is up for auction, and the bids have already surpassed six figures.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000624736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624736"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624736">© Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For those that don’t know, the “Prerelease Raichu” card is the stuff of legend. According to reports dating back to the late ’90s, around 11 copies of the original Raichu card with “PRERELEASE” text stamped in the corner of the artwork were accidentally produced by Wizards of the Coast employees. These cards were mixed in with pre-release Clefable cards that were given out at events in the ’90s, and they were supposed to have been destroyed, though a few were supposedly saved by WOTC workers. Back in 2023, CGC Cards </span><a href="https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/12277/"><span>certified two of the Raichu cards</span></a><span>, confirming that they were indeed legitimate. Now, one of these legendary cards is up for auction on </span><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-raichu-14-unlimited-base-set-prerelease-psa-trading-card-game-ex-mt-6-wizards-of-the-coast-1999-holo-rare/a/7424-36062.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515"><span>Heritage Auctions</span></a><span>, and as of this writing, its current bid is a whopping $135,000.</span></p> <p><span>It’s certainly not the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633"><span>most money anyone’s ever paid for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card</span></a><span>, but it is a pretty cool piece of history that probably should go somewhere other than a WOTC employee’s attic. As of right now, only a couple of these rare misprints are accounted for. It’s entirely possible some of these Raichu cards have been lost or destroyed in the past 25 years, but at least someone might be able to save and preserve one of them. Someone with more money than I’ll probably see in this lifetime. What do you think it’s like to be so rich you can just drop six figures on a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card? At least it’s being spent on my underappreciated favorite. $135,000 isn’t nearly enough for you, Raichu. Someone raise the bid. Put your money where your mouth is.</span></p>

              <p>After seven long years, <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> has finally left the realm of games we’re always hoping to see at some event or showcase. Silkpost no more. We can all finally play <i>Silksong–</i>and for just 20 bucks at that!</p> <p>With a few days of playtime under their belts, folks have flocked to the internet to opine, elating over finally getting to play such a long-awaited game, and despairing over a surprisingly steeper learning curve than some were expecting.</p> <p>So let’s turn our attention to the Steam reviews section of <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i> to see how it’s faring with the chorus.</p> <p>At the time of writing, <i>Silksong</i> is enjoying a “Very Positive” status for its English-language reviews. Fans have rushed in to share their enthusiasm for the long-awaited game. Those who aren’t as excited, as you might expect, are frustrated with not merely the difficulty, but how various challenges seem to feel like unfair “gotcha” moments. Many positive reviews, however, echo back that the game is much more manageable once you get deeper into the story and have amassed some more powerful skills.</p> <p>So let’s jump into some standout reviews, both of the silly and (somewhat) useful kind.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000624693" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624693"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624693">©
