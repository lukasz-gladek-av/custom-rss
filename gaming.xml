            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, the stars align and a game manages to rack up tens of thousands of players on Steam, seemingly from out of nowhere. Such is the case with&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, a new platformer that asks you to climb out of the depths of hell.</p>
<p>Since its release last Wednesday,&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been rocketing up the Steam charts, and unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular">definitely-not-a-scam "game"&nbsp;<em>Banana</em></a>, this one doesn't seem to be offering any kind of financial incentive to its players.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a physics platformer that's all about climbing out of hell, and it can be tackled either by yourself or with up to three friends in local multiplayer. If you ask me, though, it rather seems like&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>has been built around co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=NFFxZ6bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-hanging.jpg?itok=9ELkVgR_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Together</em>&nbsp;is rocketing up the Steam charts.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not entirely clear what's behind&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>'s meteoric (and entirely appropriate, given the subject matter) rise, but absent any kind of artificial boost, a number of factors could be at play here.</p>
<p>The game has a pretty low price point; at time of writing, it's available for $4.49, which is only a 10% discount on its usual price of $4.99. That's a solid price for any group of friends looking to take a punt on a new co-op experience.</p>
<p>It's also a simple, straightforward game in the vein of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed"><em>Human: Fall Flat</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/popular-indie-game-only-up-suddenly-removed-from-steam"><em>Only Up!</em></a>, and it doesn't appear to offer any kind of microtransactions or live-service elements, which may well be refreshing for those looking for a multiplayer game devoid of such things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=detJPyg5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-together-steam-success-falling.jpg?itok=jxbaF0af 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of moment is probably why&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is popular.</figcaption></figure><p>There is also, of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>is a pretty good game to stream; it's got plenty of laugh-out-loud emergent moments, and going by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its Steam reviews</a>, it's also a great way to get angry at your friends, which never fails to shift a few copies.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try&nbsp;<em>Chained Together</em>, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2567870/Chained_Together/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">grab it right now on PC via Steam</a>. It's only a few dollars, so it's almost certainly worth an hour or two of your time at the very least.</p>

        <p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>EU regulators have opened a new investigation following claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">Apple is not complying with EU rules</a>.</p>
<p>The European Commission – which started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">investigating Apple's alleged non-compliance</a> back in March – has accused Apple of breaching its Digital Markets Act, meaning Apple could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the firm's global annual revenue. That may not sound like much, but when you consider that Apple generates £301bn ($383bn) a year, that's a sizeable punishment.</p>
<p>Any further offences could even see the fine increased to 20 percent.</p>

<p>Apple, Google owner Alphabet, and Facebook owner Meta are all being investigated by the EU under the Digital Market Act (DMA), key legislation designed to keep competition fair.</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google are being investigated over their mobile app stores, which the EU previously ordered must allow greater competition on their respective platforms.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">previously-announced solution to satisfy DMA rules has drawn fire</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">fees and limits, which make launching games or apps outside of the App Store costly</a> – something long-time legal rival Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney called "hot garbage".</p>
<p>"Today is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA," Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition and digital chief, said in a statement earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/apple-eu-competition-rules/index.html?Date=20240624">CNN</a>), which also confirmed the regulatory body has also opened another investigation into Apple's new contractual requirements that require app developers to pay a "core technology fee" each time their app is installed.</p>
<p>"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers."</p>
<p>In response, Apple said: "All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EaVGEn">The Game of Thrones TV universe has had its fair share of childish, petulant, fair-haired kings. And at first, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2</a><em>’</em>s addition to that lineup, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23379127/house-dragon-kids-are-screwed">Aegon II Targaryen</a> (Tom Glynn-Carney), seemed like he could end up just a slightly less evil rehash of Joffrey, like the series taking its foot off the gas and playing the hits. But in the first two episodes of the season, Aegon has already proven that there’s plenty to separate him from <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ greatest villain. </p>
<p id="H1cccH">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2. It also contains spoilers for <em>Game of Thrones</em>, if that’s somehow a concern for you.]</p>
<p id="pYjAPg">Joffrey is, by necessity, a pretty simple character. In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like">season 2 of <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, when he first really steps into power, the show is introducing half a dozen new factions and twice as many characters. Joffrey’s immature, cruel, violent, impulsive, and generally thoughtless in most of his actions. That isn’t to say his character is bad because it’s simple, just that he fills in a very necessary role. The season is a maelstrom of morally gray characters with Joffrey in the center to give the audience an anchor, like a measuring point to judge the comparative evil of every other king; when everyone else is morally complex, it helps to have a villain to orient ourselves around. </p>
<p id="u3LBUJ">But like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">most of the characters in <em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, Aegon is far more nuanced than his closest <em>Game of Thrones</em> counterpart. </p>

<p id="oLGouw">In his earliest moments this season, Aegon gets a similar setup. We see him at a small council meeting, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405183/house-dragon-review-episode-9-alicent-aegon-rhaenys">acting like a brash child</a>, pushing for war in an instant, furious that anyone would <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/23289499/house-of-the-dragon-aegon-conqueror-prophecy-ice-and-fire-game-of-thrones">question his claim to the throne</a>. But his humanity doesn’t take long to emerge. During his time seeing to the concerns of his lowborn subjects, it becomes clear that Aegon wants to be a good king. He tries to loosen the livestock tax on farmers, only to be told that it would cripple his dragons, and he clearly wants to give the smiths the money they request. Neither of these, as Otto points out, are particularly good decisions. But they’re empathetic and understandable all the same, in a way that Joffrey never could be. </p>
<p id="2EZ72g">In that way, Aegon is more affected by tragedy than Joffrey ever was. In the second episode of the season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">after the death of his son and heir</a>, Aegon is broken in a more nuanced way than <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters ever have been, at least on screen. We see him impulsively call for war and Rhaenyra’s head; we see him kill the former Goldcloak that was caught attempting to ferry his son’s head out of King’s Landing; and we see him cry alone in his room in one of the saddest television scenes in recent memory, made even more poignant by the fact that Alicent simply walks out of the room when she sees this, too sad herself to even confront her son. </p>

<p id="ZTK0L3">It’s all the impetuous restlessness that we saw from Aegon during the first episode’s small council meetings, but manifesting itself though grief instead of boredom. Aegon’s spoiled life distances him from tragedy but doesn’t immunize him to it. So when it comes for him, too, he has no idea what to do with those feelings. It’s deeply, inescapably, and devastatingly human, all in ways that Joffrey never needed to be. And that’s exactly what <em>House of the Dragon</em> needs, with its tangled web of familial conflicts, misunderstandings, and backhanded power grabs. </p>
<p id="zTw6lX">Unsurprisingly, the best summary for the kind of king Aegon II Targaryen is, and how different he is from Joffrey, comes from <em>Game of Thrones</em> itself. In the original series’ second season, Tyrion tells Joffrey that Westeros has had vicious kings and idiot kings, but that Joffrey might be its first vicious idiot king. In Tyrion’s parlance, Aegon is an idiot king. Not the insulting kind of idiot that Tyrion intended, but a tragic kind of idiot. In another time, Aegon could have had a fine enough reign, and that fact alone creates a massive gulf between him and Joffrey, and makes Aegon an even sadder character in the process. </p>

<p>Season 5 of Diablo 4 <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is approaching</a>, and with it comes a brand new survival mode for players to experience. </p>



<p>Known as Infernal Hordes, this new mode becomes unlocked after completing the new questline for the season.</p>



<p>“The Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards,” Blizzard says. “Successfully slay the Hordes and you’ll be able to fight the powerful Fell Council.”</p>



<p>As far as how the mode works, Infernal Hordes sees enemies attack in 90-second waves. After each 90-second wave, you’ll get to decide between three Infernal Offers before the next wave starts. These Infernal Offers will give you options such as increasing the difficulty for more rewards, increasing overall damage, and more. They can also stack as you move through your run.</p>



<p>As you fight, you’ll earn Burning Aether to spend at the end of a run.</p>



<p>“Successfully slay all waves in the Tier you are attempting to advance to the Well of Hatred then battle the Fell Council,” Blizzard continued. “Upon defeating the Fell Council, spend your Burning Aether on Spoils of Hell.”</p>



<p>Spoils of Hell offers four different options after a successful run: Spoils of Equipment, Spoils of Materials, Spoils of Gold, and Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>



<p>In addition to the Infernal Hordes mode, Season 5 will feature new weapons and items, updates to endgame bosses, and more. Currently, Season 5 content is available in the public test realm (PTR) that runs from June 25 – July 2. To join the PTR, you simply have to select the “Public Test Realm” <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#PTR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">option from the dropdown</a> above the play button in Battle.net. </p>

                <p>Wipeout first launched for PlayStation and DOS in 1995, and it quickly became a cult classic. The series would go on to earn multiple sequels on PlayStation platforms over the next two decades, all of which followed the same futuristic racing blueprint laid out by the original. If you're a dedicated fan of the series, you'll likely be interested in the upcoming <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a></strong>--a hardcover volume that details the game's creation and how the series played a role in shaping the racing genre. The book releases on <strong>November 12</strong>, and preorders are seeing a slight discount ahead of its launch.</p><div title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2470" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6524456 - Wipeout Futurism Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021767?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$56 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Wipeout Futurism: The Graphic Archives contains 320 pages filled with commentary, concept art, and additional designs related to Wipeout.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5-1-0-adds-free-legendary-hero-and-more.909771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-510<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have released the patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0, which brings a new Legendary Hero, a new game mode to enjoy, and more.</p>
<p>The patch, which is scheduled to arrive tomorrow, introduces the free Legendary Hero Karanak, the Hound of Vengeance. He can stop enemy Lords or Heroes from moving, and he can summon Flesh Hounds to fight alongside him, too.</p>
<p>When enemy units are routing, Karanak gains extra melee attack damage and weapon strength, and he can also reveal hidden units within his radius, so there's no hiding from this tracking hound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=GRQ4eVLw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-3-patch-5.1.0-conquest-mode.jpg?itok=jGfQYTl3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>Patch 5.1.0 also brings a new game mode to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Karanak, you can also look forward to a brand new game mode in the form of Conquest, a competitive battle mode that uses the same rules as Land Battle but adds a central capture point to fight over.</p>
<p>To achieve victory in this mode, you'll have to hold that capture point and generate 500 victory tickets. Don't worry, though; this mode won't be replacing Land Battles, as it's primarily designed for multiplayer.</p>
<p>Conquest will utilize 42 "repurposed Land Battle maps" picked by competitive&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>players. Those maps will include Alpine Ridge, Cliff of Beasts, and Mortis Wastes, among others.</p>
<p>Other changes in the patch's rather extensive patch notes include adding an AI option to Domination Mode (as in a CPU player, not generative AI), as well as the addition of Daemons of Chaos to ranked play and much more.</p>

Grab a cup of coffee, though, because it's a pretty long list.</p>
<p>These patch notes arrive just a couple of days after&nbsp;<em>Total War: Rome 2&nbsp;</em>programmer Julian McKinlay released a lengthy statement detailing his experiences at Creative Assembly during the development of that project.</p>
<p>McKinlay says that "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-developers-add-content-aplenty-to-latest-next-dlc-following">recent events</a> involving <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-leadership-apologizes-for-warhammer-3-and-pharaoh-mistakes-promises-action-to">Creative Assembly</a>" prove that his "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it">experiences are still relevant</a> years later".

It's another long one.</p>
<p><em>Total War: Warhammer 3&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC</a>. Patch 5.1.0 launches tomorrow.</p>

The biggest new piece is online play, so you don’t need to have friends over to go head to head or play The Punisher in co-op. You can play online in casual or ranked matches. There's a leaderboard for high score challenges and screen filters to make the games look more how they did on CRT displays.</p><p>Also included is a library of design documents and artwork used in the development and promotion of the games, as well as a music player. There's a training mode, where you can practice your special moves and see things like hit boxes for each character. And for newcomers who don’t want to learn all the special moves, there’s a one-button feature you can enable to help them keep up with veterans. All of the arcade games are available in their English or Japanese versions as well.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-collectors-edition-preorder">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-release-date-collectors-edition">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite Reload Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Fortnite Reload also features a twist that seems to take inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>--players who are eliminated can reboot, provided that at least one of their fellow squadmates is alive. But there are some limitations. Here's how rebooting works in Fortnite Reload:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Once eliminated, players can choose to start their reboot timer rather than waiting for a squadmate to revive them.</li><li dir="ltr">Reboot timers start off at 30 seconds, but can scale up to 40 seconds as the match progresses.</li><li dir="ltr">Once the timer runs out, the player is rebooted.</li><li dir="ltr">Surviving teammates can shave time off a downed player's reboot timer by downing and eliminating opponents--or wiping an entire squad.</li><li dir="ltr">Near the end of the match, reboots become unavailable, something players may wish to keep this in mind when playing.</li><li dir="ltr">If all players in a squad are taken out, there's no coming back, and that squad will be permanently eliminated.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Fortnite Reload includes a series of intro quests that can earn players up to 20,000 XP each. Complete some of these quests will earn you the following rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 quests completed: Digital Dogfight Contrail</li><li dir="ltr">6 quests completed: Pool Cubes Wrap</li><li dir="ltr">9 quests completed: NaNa Bath Back Bling</li><li dir="ltr">Earn a Victory Royale: The Rezzbrella Glider</li></ul><p>To access Fortnite Reload, log in to Fortnite and select the "Fortnite Reload" tile from the Discover screen. Then squad up with some friends--or some random teammates--and prepare to fight your way to victory.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-aetheryte-london<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has unveiled a real-life Aetheryte Crystal landmark at London's King's Cross St. Pancras train station to celebrate the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>.</p>
<p>The newest expansion for the critically-acclaimed MMO is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-expansion-release-date-collectors-edition">launching on July 2nd</a>, and to commemorate its impending release, a life-size Aetheryte Crystal has been placed outside one of central London's busiest train stations.</p>
<p>If you're in the area, you'll be able to visit the crystal until 11pm tonight, after which point it'll be removed. Make sure you don't try to teleport to it after that, and don't set it as your free return location; who knows where you might end up?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=26dHDl4n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=Ir8e0oSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It'd be pretty convenient if you could just teleport to this thing, eh?</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this Aetheryte doesn't have the same properties as the ones in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so you won't just be able to teleport to it by paying a nominal fee (or, indeed, for free if it's set as your return point).</p>
<p>At least, I assume that's the case. It may be that this crystal does indeed contain the secrets of teleportation, and that our lowly species has yet to discover the way to unlock those secrets. For now, though, I'd stick to taking the trains.</p>
<p>This crystal business is all in aid of publicizing the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>, the latest expansion for Square Enix's much-loved MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>is set to be the start of a new saga for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>after 2021's&nbsp;<em>Endwalker&nbsp;</em>concluded a ten-year saga with a suitably emotional bang, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-update-655-screenshots-tease-dawntrail-story-with-pictomancer-krile">the story for this one</a> seems like it'll be decidedly more light-hearted and adventure-filled.</p>

<p>As well as telling a new story,&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>will also raise&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s level cap to 100, and it'll introduce two new DPS jobs: the magical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-expansion-dawntrail-reveals-new-job-pictomancer-withg-spectacular">Pictomancer</a> and the melee-focused <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-reveal-recap-new-viper-job-ffxi-crossover-tons-of-content">Viper</a>.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>launches on July 2nd across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S. If you tune into Twitch streams marked with the Viewer Rewards tag between then and July 29th, you <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1805171513626329329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">could earn an adorable Chocorpokkur mount</a>, so make sure to keep your eye out for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-shang-chi-and-more-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're back with another new set review for the fast-paced, kinetic&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, a tabletop miniatures skirmish game from Atomic Mass Games featuring your favorite characters from across the Marvel universe. We most recently covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-professor-x-nightcrawler-and-more-review">a large batch releases, including Professor X, Nightcrawler, and more</a>. Now we're checking out two new releases: first up is Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner, and from there we move onto Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable -- read on for our review!</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=y1eUYLWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=MvV9f3FS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From Wakanda to Atlantis, heroes come together!</figcaption></figure><p>First let's look Black Panther, Chosen of Bast - who brings his hand-to-hand combat skills to the table in a new version of the character (the game has previously released the character as: <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/character/black-panther-killmonger/">Black Panther</a>, this new "Chosen of Bast" moniker makes this an entirely different version of the character).</p>
<h3>Black Panther, Chosen of Bast</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=x3qW7V7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=9YBoQxin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The addition of Wallcrawler really emphasizes his mobility!</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see from the above stat card, this version of the character is a 3 Threat character (the previous incarnation is 4 threat) and features a balanced defense. Retaining the very fun "Pounce" ability the former version of the card also had, he's now kitted out with the very powerful Spirit Predator ability.</p>
<p>I found myself immediately drawn to that big, nasty attack - where you're rolling 7 dice and (with a little luck) then able to unleash your Builder for free. In one of my games, this lead to him almost one-shotting Mysterio. It's these kinds of interactions that make me fall more in love with&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>&nbsp;every day -- it truly is just a chance to play What If? on a grand scale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=REaiw9pI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=jZILFF4s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to strike!</figcaption></figure><p>Playing with Black Panther, I was impressed with his ability to navigate the battlefield now that he has Wallcrawler. With a larger base, in my playthrough I had him constantly moving around the board, throwing himself with Pounce, and getting the jump on objectives with Insight of the Ancients.</p>
<p>Statistics-wise I feel like he's fairly middle-of-the-road for a 3 cost character (though I do like that all of his attacks are Mystic-based), but that doesn't mean he's not an incredibly useful addition to your crew. Use him (obviously) with other Wakanda affiliated characters to great effectiveness, or throw him in an Avengers lineup and just lean on him to get stuck in and deal serious damage.</p>
<h3>Namor, the Sub-Mariner</h3>
<p>Next up in the pack, making his&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>debut, is the isolationist king himself Namor, the Sub-Mariner. Let's go ahead and take the plunge (sorry) and check out his stat card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=wui7s9tZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=0qRnidWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knew Namor was a Gem Bearer!?</figcaption></figure><p>As his 5-threat power level suggests, Namor, the Sub-Mariner is a seriously powerful character. While play testing Namor, the number one thing that was immediately obvious was how shockingly fast this character is. He's on a large base, has flight, and he's got a Move Long, which means he was absolutely zipping across the battlefield the entire game.</p>
<p>With 7 Health on both sides of his card, he's also incredibly sturdy, allows nearby allies (and himself) to reroll 1 die in their attack and defense rolls, gains extra Power,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>his attacks and effects can't be reduced or prevented by superpowers or Team Tactic Cards. So why does all of that matter? Because that's all passive bonuses that don't require an energy spend.</p>
<p>This means that - even setting aside his attacks for a moment (which we'll get to shortly) - he's a highly mobile, <em>extremely</em>&nbsp;hard-hitting model who can even slightly, passively buff his teammates.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor.jpg?itok=7py5bkAq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor.jpg?itok=8x_37JxV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Prince Namor looking extremely ripped bursting out of the sea!</figcaption></figure><p>But it's his two attacks that were most impressive in my playtesting. His builder attack allows him to Advance toward his target distance Small, but his Armies of the Deep attack is the real stunner here. As you can see from the card above, he either calls a swarm of crabs, an octopus, or a wave of turtles to crush the foe. That's... hilarious? In my playtesting, he sent a devastating Wave of Turtles crashing into Doc Ock (missed opportunity not sending the octopus after him, but I had a game to win here).</p>
<p>All in all, for sheer maneuverability,&nbsp;I think Namor deserves some serious consideration for your list. He hits hard, is a sturdy fighter, and has multiple abilities that allow him to either stay on his opponents or do a bit of zone control by pushing them away.</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi-and-silver-sable.jpg?itok=GlVlMX02 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi-and-silver-sable.jpg?itok=lCxwdSis 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Up next is everyone's favorite martial artist, Shang-Chi, and the famous mercenary known as Silver Sable!</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;a big fan of more on-the-ground heroes and villains, so I knew this character pack would be right in my wheelhouse. Let's start with Shang-Chi!</p>
<h3>Shang-Chi</h3>
<figure role="group"><figcaption>We're showing both sides of Shang-Chi's card here because of how his attacks subtly change between his healthy and injured side.</figcaption></figure><p>He's exactly what you'd expect from a character who's main form of super-heroism comes from on-the-ground, fist-to-fist combat, though the Range 3 on his Rising Phoenix Kick has a much nicer range than I could have hoped for with this martial artist. His "Supreme Martial Artist" ability, where he counts blanks as successes when defending a close-combat fight, is super thematic.</p>
<p>And while all of his attacks, on both sides of his card (we love new attacks opening up on an Injured card side), are potent and powerful - I think the main takeaway for how to play Shang-Chi is to use him to really manage hot objective areas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=N59-KHP5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=nQ30_lHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shang-Chi doesn't even need the rings to lay a hurt on his opponents.</figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't necessarily lean on him to hold objectives, but he should constantly be pushing enemies out of range with moves like "Dragon Chases Its Tail" and "One Inch Punch." With his ability to sneak in little small moves, and push enemies around the board, it'll be hard to face off against him and stay put in one spot.</p>
<p>In other words, Shang-Chi is great at letting someone else hold objects while he ensures high-danger enemies aren't allowed to stick in and cause problems.</p>
<h3>Silver Sable</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=Sj-Ewf0W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=RGId5wJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get comfy in your Sniper Nest and pick off your enemies.</figcaption></figure><p>For Silvija Sablinova, there are no radioactive spider bites to nurse, no exposure to gamma rays... nothing but a big, terrifying looking sniper rifle! And it's for this reason that this character is such a fun welcome to the game. I have to admit, I'm a sucker for long-range characters in&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, and there aren't many out there with a Range 5.</p>
<p>Of all her special abilities here, for me - in my playtesting at least - it was all about the Sniper Nest and Headshot. Just build up her power, get her high up, and start cracking at enemies out in the open. Easy to pilot as a character, there's not a ton of complexity to Silver Sable, but she's so much fun to play.</p>
<p>I do wonder if she's worth the 4 threat, as Silver Sable feels like more of a 3 threat character, but with Shot Caller, and some of her tactics cards (which you should check out in depth on <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/from-panel-to-play-silver-sable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Atomic Mass site</a>), she can be a really potent addition to your team.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable.jpg?itok=L3zUT8CR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable.jpg?itok=xu9RlPEu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol - New Character Packs Final Thoughts</em></h2>
<p>I think that both of these new character packs are really strong additions to the game. The new Black Panther is a very powerful striker, and Namor is so slippery on the battlefield he's a must-add for anyone running a S.H.I.E.L.D. list. And both Shang-Chi and Silver Sable are fun characters who do very different things.</p>
<p>It's always hard for me to give a sort of final thought roundup on miniatures when we're dealing with a collection of different ones, so what I really want to say in this space is: do these characters interest you? Do they feel like they'd be a good fit in your lists? Overall, for me, the most important thing about each of these four miniatures is that none of them feel boring.</p>
<p>Instead, each of these characters are rendered onto the tabletop in ways that feel true to their roots, the miniature designs look absolutely amazing, and each has the ability to create a fun, engrossing moment. I've always felt that you get the most interesting moments from non-core characters with&nbsp;<em>MCP</em>&nbsp;- Iron Man's great and all, but isn't it more interesting to lumber around the field as Arnim Zola?</p>
<p>That's how I feel about fielding Namor or Silver Sable, these are characters that are well-loved, but they haven't been MCU-ified to death (not that there's anything wrong with MCU, but it takes some of the mystique away from a character when we've lived with them in live action for years). So that's why I really love these packs - the characters are powerful, and shake up the world of the game a bit!</p>

  <p id="T4eTkV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion is upon us, with the game going down for a <strong>48-hour maintenance</strong> ahead of its early access period.</p>
<p id="5wVwvm">While <em>Dawntrail </em>itself launches fully on July 2, players who pre-ordered the new expansion will be able to play it early on June 28 after the lengthy maintenance.</p>
<p id="OaI2sb">Below, we explain when <em>FFXIV Dawntrail</em> maintenance begins and what last-minute things you can do to ensure you’re all set for the expansion’s launch.</p>
<hr id="qsgp2D">
<h2 id="n3Ji6Z">
<strong>What time does </strong><em><strong>FFXIV </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Wednesday, June 26, </strong>at the following times and will be unavailable for 48 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>2 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>5 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>10 a.m. BST </strong>for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>11 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>6 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>7 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="6uHLB9">That said, the game will come back up at the same time, but on <strong>Friday, June 28</strong>. You will only have access to <em>Dawntrail</em> content if you pre-ordered the expansion. </p>
<hr id="NWnzlD">
<h2 id="iRht83"><strong>What should I do before FFXIV Dawntrail maintenance?</strong></h2>
<p id="IDt6i0">Ahead of maintenance, there’s plenty of things you can do to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24167088/dawntrail-prepare-how-to-get-ready">prepare for <em>Dawntrail</em></a>. Outside of stuff we list in our guide, you should also make sure to <strong>put any gardening plots away</strong> so that your crops don’t wither — the timer for the crops will keep going, even during maintenance. You should also <strong>refresh your </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115574/how-to-get-a-house-apartment-lottery-wards-plots"><strong>housing timer</strong></a>, if you have a house. During <em>Endwalker</em>’s launch, you couldn’t enter your house due to extreme server congestion, so it’s best to reset that timer now before congestion possibly occurs.</p>
<p id="vrOOnL">If you plan on using a Fantasia to change into the newly added female Hrothgar, you should <strong>use you Fantasia before maintenance</strong>. You’ll also need to <strong>unequip everything</strong> before being able to Fantasia. Since you have to relog to actually change races, you’ll be able to change right away upon your first login after maintenance. (If the login queues and aforementioned congestion are as bad as they were during <em>Endwalker</em>, you will not want to relog for that Fantasia, as you may end up stuck in a login queue for hours.)</p>
<p id="ORAoAM">Last but not least, you should make sure to <strong>log off in a sanctuary</strong> (in a town or near an Aetheryte) to make sure you accumulate <strong>rested EXP</strong> — which is a 50% EXP bonus up until a certain amount.</p>

  <p id="ooDeLN">Horror comic fans will get a windfall this October with <em>Through Red Windows</em>, a new series from the combined and formidable talents of writer Ram V (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/12/6/23488554/best-comics-2022-graphic-novels"><em>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr</em></a>, <em>Detective Comics</em>) and artist Joëlle Jones (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/2/3/22244520/yara-flor-wonder-girl-woman-cw-brazilian"><em>Wonder Girl</em></a>, <em>Lady Killer</em>), published by Dstlry. </p>
<p id="uLK8LQ">“<em>Through Red Windows</em> has been an exercise in [sowing] discomfort,” Jones told Polygon via email.</p>
<p id="eQjlJ6">The series follows up-and-coming financier Athul Laal, who accepts an invitation to live in his plutocratic mentor’s 73-story Manhattan residence and office building. Then, as Jones put it, “chaos and viscera” ensue.</p>

<p id="90fm6i">Ram V said the series grew from his love of Edgar Allan Poe, and from making a lot of friends in the architecture department during college, which instilled in him a fascination for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n7ylXPueYE">altered reality within highly designed spaces</a>. </p>
<p id="ycK7ge">“Psycho-geography has also been an ongoing obsession of my work,” Ram told Polygon via email. “The high-rise element of this story comes from there. I’d also been interested in telling a story that looked at wealth, old wealth as a sort of Eldritch Entity with eternal self-perpetuation as a motive. And I’d wanted to tell a story of the dehumanizing nature of modern day ambition, especially as I see it in the nouveau riche, Indian entrepreneur.”</p>
<p id="SM5r1i">“The business aesthetic is inherently harsh and desaturated; greys, whites, blacks, and navy blues set around right angles,” Jones said of her work on the series. “It’s incredibly austere. Having that contrast against the eldritch and supernatural has been a fantastic challenge and a lot of fun—it’s injecting chaos and viscera into a design that relies on uniformity and perfection. Hopefully you’ll never read another comic like it.”</p>
<p id="xBtv13">Jones shared two pages of strikingly colored interior art from the upcoming first issue. [<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The pages contain a depiction of suicide.]</p>

Keep reading for the official summary of the first issue, and a look at the main and variant covers by Jones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="qHTRdl">When ailing Plutocrat, Harlan Roderick, invites his young protégé Athul Laal to live at Roderick Place in downtown Manhattan, what Athul believes this to be his first step into the inner circle of the world’s elite, soon turns into a living nightmare. Athul discovers that Harlan and his illness are inextricably connected to the 73-story building, in which, behind each door, lie secrets and monsters from both Harlan and Athul’s own lives.</p>
<p id="seWB3b">Laal’s ambition gets the better of him and the higher he climbs in the company (and the building!) the deeper and darker becomes the danger to his life….and maybe his soul.</p>

To get it, you’re going to need to begin by upgrading your Crafting Bench to Uncommon, because what we’re after here is actually the “Uncommon Cool-Headed Charm.” For that you’ll need eight Planks and three Shells. After that, you’re going to want these materials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>3 Silk Thread</li><li>1 Marble</li><li>3 Sand Shell</li></ul><p>To get the Marble, you’ll also need an Uncommon level Pickaxe, and go mining in caves. For the Silk Thread, you need to beat up a bunch of nighttime spiders, and then weave their silk on a Spinning Wheel. And for those shells, you want to go take care of some Sand Rollers on the beach.<br></p><p>With all these ingredients in hand, you’ll need to head to your shiny new Crafting Bench, where the Cool-Headed Charm should now be available. This will offer you permanent resistance to some heat, allowing you to spend as much time in the desert or lava caves as you wish.<br></p><h2 id="h2498"><a id=""></a>How to craft the Rare Cool-Headed Charm in <em>Lego Fortnite</em></h2><p>However, <em>Lego Fortnite</em> can get even hotter, and for those areas you’ll need to step things up even further. A more temporary measure is to stack Snowberries or Snowberry Shakes, which boost your heat resistance, the fruit found in the Frostlands. But you can take it to the next level with the Rare Cool-Headed Charm. For that, you’ll need to upgrade your Bench once more, this time to the Rare tier, which is a whole thing. To do it, you’ll need to gather:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>12 Knotroot Rods</li><li>15 Marble Slabs</li><li>6 Sand Claws</li><li>3 Sand Shells</li></ul><p>That done, you can upgrade your Uncommon Cool-Headed Charm to Rare with the following ingredients:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>3 Heavy Wool Thread.</li><li>5 Frost Shell.</li><li>1 Sand Brute Scale.</li><li>3 Malachite Slabs.</li></ul><p>Now you can go stand on the surface of the sun itself. Or, perhaps in a future upgrade. But for now you’re good to fight off the hottest climes.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Palworld Sakurajima Update | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2>Finding the Sakurajima Island in Palworld</h2><p>As you might expect, a majority of the new content in the DLC resides on the new Sakurajima Island. This island isn't on a separate map from the original island, but you won't be able to see it right when you load up an old or new save. Instead, you need to discover the island and uncover its surroundings like you did with the original Palpagos Islands map.</p><p>Sakurajima Island is located on the northwestern side of the existing map. The island is situated just north of Icy Wind Island and Forgotten Island and to the southwest of the Astral Mountains. When you first load in after downloading the Sakurajima DLC, you'll just see a sea of blacked-out map. If you keep traveling into the blacked-out part of the map, Sakurajima Island makes itself visible quickly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322214" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322214"></a><figcaption>The location of Sakurajima Island. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png"></figure><h2>Level Requirement for the Sakurajima DLC</h2><p>Of course, just because you can visit the new island whenever you want doesn't necessarily mean you should. The developers at PocketPair have made a conscious decision to make the Sakurajima DLC a part of the endgame content in Palworld. This means lower-level players won't be able to visit the island without being severely overmatched by the Pals that call the location home.</p><p>In my experience, the lowest levels Pals on Sakurajima Island are roughly level 42-43. There aren't too many Pals in the lower 40s, though, as most of them are in the mid-upper 40s in the early parts of the island. As you continue and explore deeper and deeper, the Pals' levels increase to 50 and above. While many of the Pals on Sakurajima Island don't pose a massive threat, they are definitely strong enough to wipe out your entire party if you're not at the right level.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322373"></a><figcaption>The new region in Palworld is not friendly to new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png"></figure><p>The real trouble you'll face on Sakurajima Island is human NPCs. A new group inhabits the island, which consists of level 45 NPCs, and they quickly eliminated a level 51 Jettragon, Blazamut, and Orserk in a matter of seconds. While some Pals can certainly cause you issues, these new NPCs are what you truly need to look out for, especially if you're not level 50 yet.</p><p>Once you've reached the right level and you're ready to explore Sakurajima Island, just head to the northwest side of the map and begin uncovering the new map. It's not nearly as large as the Palpagos Islands, but there are several different biomes, bosses, and other secrets to find.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-playfusions-ascendant-is-rising-from-the-ashes-of-lightseekers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Studio discusses its transmedia ambitions and the challenges of launching a new IP into a crowded market</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Earlier this year, UK developer Playfusion unveiled its newest game Ascendant Infinity, which aims to shake up the online multiplayer space with matches that change every time.</p>
<p>The title goes beyond just changing what equipment is available, or where the point-scoring items needed to win are located; it also triggers random events such as air strikes or monster spawns that can disrupt players' strategies.</p>
<p>The studio's founder Mark Gerhard tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> that, after a long time in stealth mode, the team was relieved the initial reveal went down well: "People are looking for fresh content, stuff that's innovative. I think there's a fatigue around sequels, the next battle royale, and things like that. People are happy to see we've taken the risk to innovate, to create this 'adaption shooter' and event-driven gameplay mechanic."</p>
<p>Players, influencers, and press all loved the game, Gerhard tells us. The studio boss tells us that several media outlets criticised the name heavily, but that seemed to be the only sticking point (easily solved by dropping the 'Infinity' and re-revealing the game under the simplified title Ascendant during this month's Future Games Show). Now the team is focused on making a title that delivers on the initial hype.</p>
<p>"The team and I are super pumped – we really think we've got something special here," says Gerhard. "But the game is the tip of the iceberg. There's a crazy transmedia vision that we've been working on for nine years that we're hoping to realise, but it doesn't matter until the game works."</p>

<blockquote>"If this works, this will be an overnight success that only took ten years to make"<cite>Mark Gerhard</cite></blockquote>
<p>Details of this transmedia vision haven't been fully announced yet, but Gerhard does tell us that a pilot for a TV show has been written by the creative minds behind Arcane, the animated Netflix show based on Riot Games' League of Legends. Playfusion also holds patents for tech that Gerhard describes as "Shazam for video" that will help link the show to the game, as well as plans to put players' characters in the TV show.</p>
<p>If this sounds ambitious for an independent studio, and perhaps a little random, it's worth noting that Playfusion's debut title Lightseekers was also built around transmedia. In addition to the digital collectible card game at its heart, Lightseekers encompassed a range of toys-to-life products, with plans for comics, TV series, board games and more – but it was scuppered by the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/toys-r-us-enters-administration">collapse of a crucial partner, Toys R US</a>, just a few weeks after launch.</p>
<p>"The genesis of PlayFusion in 2015 was [that] we wanted to build this transmedia universe," Gerhard explains. "No one has delivered on transmedia – I think we need better words to describe it.</p>
<p>"Lightseekers was the start. That ended for us with tremendous sadness, of course, because we had just launched it and four weeks later, Toys R Us went bankrupt. They had everything – all our products, all our cards. And the game was free because it was there to support the ecosystem."</p>
<p>A multiplayer shooter seems like a dramatic pivot from a collectible card game for the studio, we note. But Gerhard says that the studio does have some heritage in this field.</p>
<p>While most of the team are former staff from Runescape developer Jagex, where Gerhard was once CEO, others were brought on board from Eurocom after that studio was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eurocom-ceases-trading-all-jobs-lost">closed at the end of 2012</a>. With them, they brought the talent behind the last three James Bond games: the 2010 Goldeneye reimagining for Wii, 2011's expanded Goldeneye Reloaded for Xbox and PlayStation, and 2012's 007 Legends.</p>
<p>"The team's expertise and passion really is to make the game we've made now," he says. "Lightseekers was a stepping stone or a proof point for doing this. After all of that, we recapitalised the business ourselves and just said, 'Let's just follow our dream. Let's just make our game, not a game to support toys or whatever else' – and that is Ascendant. If this works, this will be an overnight success that only took ten years to make."</p>
<p>Building a new games IP at the heart of a transmedia empire is hardly a new venture. Scores of companies, even AAA publishers, have attempted to bring their brands into other forms of entertainment in a connected way, but very few have succeeded. There are a myriad reasons why these firms have struggled and two in particular come to mind. Firstly, each transmedia product needs to stand out as best-in-class in its field, and secondly, the price of entry can be high if fans are expected to buy a range of comics, books, and more, alongside the central game.</p>
<p>"I know what you mean: if bigger companies with bigger resources, better IP, and bigger communities have not been able to be successful, why could we?" Gerhard says. "It is hard without doubt. If it was easy, it would have been done. I'm convinced this is the future of our art form, and it will evolve to this."</p>
<p>The Playfusion founder asserts that transmedia games brands have yet to truly take off because "there hasn't been the world-class example of it." But he believes that once there is – "and I'm hoping that it's us" – it will be akin to the advances Dolby made in music: once stereo became available, fewer people wanted mono experiences.</p>
<p>That said, he acknowledges that managing multiple products in different forms of entertainment increases the risk a company faces: "If any one of these legs in your three-legged chair are knocked out, you fall over. Bigger institutions like us have tried and at the first sign of failure, that's probably when they withdraw."</p>
<p>He quotes Arnold Schwarzenegger, who<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=860403125819697"> said in an interview last year</a> that: "Losers stay down but winners always get up, dust themselves off and keep going.” Gerhard says the same is true of Lightseekers and Playfusion's transmedia vision: "If you accept defeat of your first failure, you're right."</p>
<p>For now, the primary focus is the Ascendant game. Gerhard reveals the development process has actually been very different to any game he and the team has worked on before.</p>
<p>"We grey-boxed everything and just used placeholder art [for a long time]," he explains, "because we really wanted to find the fun and build the systems and the mechanics. We knew we could [make] art [for] our game.</p>
<p>"I've been on a lot of projects where art runs first and foremost because it's the most satisfying, the most visual, and because if you see awesome stuff, you think you've got an awesome game, and then you actually find that that last bit is really hard. For us, it was the inverse; we didn't even worry about art, we just said 'Let's find the fun' and hopefully build something that will be a game for the next two decades."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Gerhard adds with a laugh that once the art was put in, it caused crashes and issues with performance and framerate, so the team has been focused on addressing these ahead of the upcoming beta.</p>
<p>"Obviously, on super high-end stuff it's fine, but we want to make sure we can get as many players as possible and sort of trying to low-mid spec, but at the same time not compromise the creative vision."</p>
<p>As for expectations, Gerhard recognises that – even with its 'adaption shooter' angle – Ascendant is launching into one of the most competitive spaces on the market: live service online multiplayer shooters. But the studio's chief marketing officer Murray Pannell (formerly of PlayStation, Ubisoft, EA, 2K Games and more) remains confident about the title's chances.</p>
<blockquote>"One of our biggest challenges is the awareness and the cold start scenario"<cite>Murray Pannell</cite></blockquote>
<p>"This was so much more advanced than many other games I've been working on at the same time frame," he says. "One of our biggest challenges, particularly from a marketing point of view, is the awareness and the cold start scenario. How do you break through in a complex and crowded marketplace where there's an awful lot of institutional games that people are already embedded in and wedded to?</p>
<p>"We don't need to be as big as Fortnite or Call of Duty to be successful. We'd love to be, but that's not our initial ambition. I think we will find a really good game for a good audience who will love this and play it a lot, and we'll grow from there."</p>
<p>Gerhard concludes: "Players won't believe what they're playing came from an independent studio. People will perceive this as a big AAA production. That's where we're all hoping to put a little dent in the universe and defy convention. I think we're close to that. We've still got to breakthrough in a crowded space, but I think we can do that."</p>

            <p>FIFA may not have released a licensed football game recently, but it's ready to team up with Rocket League to introduce an all-new category to its FIFA Esports World Cup.</p>
<p>In a "groundbreaking partnership", FIFAe – that's FIFA's esports arm – <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/news/fifae-introduces-national-team-competition-featuring-rocket-league">says</a> Rocket League will feature in the upcoming FIFAe World Cup, "signif[ying] a major step in FIFA's commitment to embrace the entire ecosystem and drive the global growth of football esports globally".</p>

<p>The competition invites the 16 participating nations to submit three players and one substitute, with the nations themselves selected "based on the number of representatives from each country in previous Rocket League Majors".</p>
<p>It's not clear what cash prize participants will be fighting for, but more information about the "final event" is promised at "a later stage".</p>
<p>"The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA's member assocations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles," said Christian Volk, FIFA's director of eFootball and gaming.</p>
<p>"This milestone partnership highlights our commitment to evolve our football esports ecosystem and continue to build the biggest stages for all communities to fame their game."</p> <div>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-will-develop-the-next-fifa-game-leaker-claims">2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from a retailer which allege that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>
<p>Whilst not confirmed in any official capacity at all – which means we can only take this news as a hefty rumour for now – it does back up prior claims from <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1756869003518042403">earlier this year</a> that 2K and FIFA may have been in talks for the former to succeed development of the FIFA series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after EA announced</a> it would be taking its football franchise forward without FIFA branding.</p>
<p>Not that that seems to have done EA any harm; EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>

This makes it a hardcore mode because of how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-stardew-valley-updated-1762894608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-stardew-valley-updated-1762894608">essential</a></span> the wiki has become for many players. It acts as a repository of knowledge on when certain plants are in season, how long they take to water, how much money you can sell plants for, what gifts villagers like, where certain fish are, and more. <em>Stardew Valle</em>y’s cute aesthetic hides a lot of depth, and tackling the game sans guides is an extremely tall order.</p><p>So how does hardcore mode pull save deletion off?

If it is, the mod erases your precious <em>Stardew Valley</em> save. </p><p>It’s a brutal but incredibly funny mod. It’s also incredible that it went live just twelve hours after the original joke from <em>Hard Drive</em>. I for one will never touch this mode because I value my farm and my relationship with Leah too much to start over.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
