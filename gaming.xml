In recent years, our efforts to recognize the best video games of the past 12 months always come with a caveat: Yes, great games undeniably come out, but things are bad for the industry. The world makes another trip around the sun and things only seem to get more dire and precarious for people who make the video games we know and love. Workers are laid off at an unsustainable frequency, if their studios and projects aren’t shut down entirely. All that we have left to celebrate is the work that talented developers still manage to create in the midst of all this instability, and that’s what we’re here to do. It’s remarkable that even under such circumstances, so many games worth celebrating are still being released, and they deserve to be heralded with as much enthusiasm as ever, if not more. It’s games like these that keep reminding us of how vital, relevant, and extraordinary this medium can be, even if some of the people running the industry are making it so much harder for such games to be made.</p><p>Here’s how we arrived at this ranking: Each member of the <em>Kotaku </em>staff submitted a top ten list, with each game being allotted a point value depending on where it was placed. If someone ranked a game as their favorite of the year, it would receive 10 points, with the second-place game receiving nine, the third getting eight, and so on. Once the results of those ballots were tallied, there was some deliberation about the presence and placement of a few games, and in the end, we landed here. Without further ado, here are <em>Kotaku</em>’s top 15 games of 2024.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-recommend-id="image://a5211c87e43b01f3e0a7380473e15549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iris holds a bloody knife at someone off-screen while saying &quot;Did I not give you life?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span><em> </em>is so dense and rich in themes that trying to sum it all up here in a few paragraphs feels like a disservice to just how much developer Sunset Visitor’s narrative adventure explores in its dozen or so hours. What starts off as a sci-fi exploration of identity in a society made up entirely of clones ends up interrogating so many ideas that its thesis could be articulated in as many ways as its diverging clones view the world. Despite everything it explores, <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels singular in its vision, building upon its most basic ideas to deliver anime-inspired melodrama that leads to out-of-this-world conclusions grounded in the human desire for connection.</p><p>So much of <em>1000xRESIST</em> is depicted through the memories of one woman, with her clones viewing and interpreting it all through their own eyes. Even then, however, they are limited by her perspective. <em>1000xRESIST</em> ends on a note that suggests history can be defined by the victors in any conflict, no matter how just one’s cause might be. Its final moments ask you to remember what it means to hold that power and decide what to do with it. As much as <em>1000xRESIST </em>juggles, it’s all in service of making you understand the position you’re put in during that final segment. You can resist something a thousand times over and not know what to do when you’ve finally won. <em>1000xRESIST</em>’s ability to concisely reach that conclusion is a testament to what Sunset Visitor achieved. Lesser games would have caved under the weight of communicating so much narrative and thematic depth in such a short experience. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man whose burnt face is covered in bandages looks at the screen as an emergency screen flashes in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wrong Organ’s psychological horror game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> excels at packing heaps of mental anguish into a small space without once losing its grip on the point it’s trying to make. Its excruciating two hours tell the story of a delivery crew shipwrecked in space not losing their humanity, but rather facing the worst parts of what it means to be human.</p><p><em>Mouthwashing </em>has been a hard game to sit with since I played it in November. It deals with the unbearable weight of the human condition while showing how the corporate machine grinds us into the worst versions of ourselves. But it never gives the worst person in its story the space to divert the blame for their actions, even as they try. Is every person’s life boiled down to the worst thing they’ve done? Are we not pieces of every person we’ve met and every experience we’ve been through, pieced together to form something that looks like a person? Can the pain we’ve caused be wiped away by painkillers shoved down the throats of those we’ve hurt?</p><p>Take responsibility. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-recommend-id="image://d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->RGG Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-recommend-id="image://d6aa99bdb090b493c4ee51f0ac9bdb81" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth stands in front of a cabin and looks at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love a game filled with profound or thought-provoking moments. I also love having fun. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Infinite Wealth</em></a></span> fits the bill on both counts, but it puts the emphasis on fun with its zany, absurd antics, rewarding turn-based combat, and an endearing protagonist who serves as a great reminder that we should strive to see the positive side of difficult situations. My time spent with <em>Infinite Wealth</em> also reminded me that I don’t always need to find some emotionally overwhelming or intellectually fascinating reason to be enthralled by a game, I can just have goofy fun with loveable characters in relatable situations.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>:<em> </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>Well, as relatable as the life of ex-Japanese gangsters can be. <em>Infinite Wealth</em> does have some serious elements, such as the protagonist’s complicated relationship with the world around him and the strange, uncertain conditions of his birth. But it also navigates perfectly innocent and silly stuff, like a first date gone wrong, the absurdity of the gig economy, and being inebriated with friends.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth</em> is also a hell of a good RPG. Combat in particular is excellent, fusing turn-based actions with real-time positioning that allows you to do things like line up attacks and send enemies flying into one another. The game also handles its side content particularly well, with objectives and activities that are more than happy to get out of the way of the main story if you’re not interested in tackling them. But if you do dive in, you’ll find some wildly satisfying and engaging elements to engage with, such as an entire resort management sim, a <em>Pokémon</em>-like collect-and-battle mini-game, and more.</p><p>As a newcomer to the <em>Yakuza</em> series, I was also delighted to find the story very approachable. On occasion, the game would reference previous events in the series that’d largely go over my head, but on the whole, the game was plenty capable of delivering a coherent, if remarkably silly, tale of ex-gangsters trying to survive normal life without getting sucked back into the hell of it all. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-recommend-id="image://730b31dc405adffad5753b9a7a65a18e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James looks up at something off-screen in a dark room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you had a time machine and warped back to 2022 and told me that the Bloober-developed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span><em> </em>remake would be not only good, but one of the best games of the year upon its release, I’d laugh. (Well, first I would ask you about the time machine, then I would giggle.) Nobody outside of Bloober and Konami had any confidence in this project and yet, when it finally launched in 2024, it ended up being a triumphant, confident, interesting, and worthwhile adaptation of the original PS2-era release<em>.</em></p><p>In some ways the remake plays it safe, while in others it experiments with puzzles and pacing (not always successfully…), and the result is a remarkably faithful, sometimes predictable, but always engaging horror game that<em> Silent Hill 2</em> veterans will enjoy. And even more impressively, newcomers to the franchise are likely to not only admire<em> Silent Hill 2</em>’s remake but walk away from it wanting to play the original version, too. And importantly, the<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remake is fucking scary in a way other modern horror games sometimes aren’t. A remarkable game that will be talked about and played for years to come. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-recommend-id="image://81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-recommend-id="image://81f09a32349fb86171d51723817270cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks out at a plain with mountains in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I was not ready for where <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a></span> was going to take me. This narrative-driven game about a troubled woman tasked with solving impossible challenges for herself and those around her warranted a number of playthroughs for me, and it continued to live on in my mind for countless hours afterwards. In fact, it still does. While many might rightly critique <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s combat and its sometimes-mediocre puzzle sequences, <em>Hellblade 2</em> remains a gripping, emotive experience if you come for its imposing, dark aesthetic and stay for the harrowing themes of struggle, perseverance, and mental illness.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p><em>Hellblade 2 </em>is as much a journey through the wilds of Iceland as they’re under siege from powerful, mythical beings as it is the tale of protagonist Senua’s struggle with her own self image. Many of the game’s moments can be examined from multiple angles, including the conclusion, which throws many of <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s fantastical elements into a contemplative place of uncertainty. What even <em>is </em>real? What are the heroic deeds on display in this game? Is it a vanquishing of giants? Or is it something deeper, more internal? <em>Hellblade 2</em> invites this kind of thought.</p><p>And while the first game was rightly celebrated for its unique depiction of mental illness through the use of binaural audio which brought the voices in Senua’s mind to life (making headphones for it and this sequel a must), I found that this game takes that aspect further, with the voices in Senua’s mind persistently raising doubts in ways that really get inside your head. As someone who struggles daily with complex anxieties and traumas, I found <em>Hellblade 2 </em>deeply relatable. Though I don’t experience the same kinds of mental illnesses Senua does, the game accurately gives voice to what it’s like to wrestle with your own thoughts in complex, obsessive ways.</p><p>It may have a short runtime, and it might have made some sacrifices to the gameplay that made its predecessor so beloved, but taken on its own terms, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is a memorable and powerful experience. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-recommend-id="image://a00a13b0ace77b0c88d5da819461f60f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sephiroth and Cloud stand alongside SOLDIER forces in a dark, rainy area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span> is like a 17th-century Baroque painting: grand, ornate, ostentatious, and confounding.

What is the point of all those freaking minigames? Endless minutiae rendered with the flare, expertise, and grand designs of ancient masters.</p><p><em>FFVII Rebirth</em> is a game that I found relentlessly engaging despite these questions. “It makes no damn sense…compels me though,” I thought to myself so many times while playing. Some games are greater than the sum of their parts. <em>FFVII Rebirth</em>’s parts are greater than the sum of most other games. It’s not quite a faithful, one-to-one remake of the middle section of the original game, nor is it a risky and bold departure. Rather, it’s a maximalist walking tour through a rich sci-fi fantasy world, blown up in evocative, beautiful, and occasionally heart-wrenching detail.</p><p>The card-based minigame Queen’s Blood is amazing. The flow of combat and the incredible camera work, especially during summons, represent the height of interactive spectacle. I can almost forgive the Cait Sith Shinra Mansion crate sequence because of Chocobo Racing, the Junon parade, the Gold Saucer VR play, and every other mini-game/ quick-time event hybrid that didn’t suck. But where <em>FFVII Rebirth</em> excels most is in giving timeless video game avatars the space to grow into regular people and break out hearts all over again. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-recommend-id="image://fecfd06fbf48af183f600b14c98629cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1914" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The cast of different games from UFO 50 surround the logo against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A staggering achievement and, for my money, the year’s most surprising, captivating, and incredible game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865"><em>UFO 50</em></a></span><em> </em>is actually a collection of 50 games, all released in the 1980s by developer UFOSoft. The thing is, however, that UFOSoft never actually existed. Instead, these are new games, a wonderful smorgasbord of games in different genres—role-playing games, platformers, side-scrolling action games, games in which you explore interesting worlds and find nifty upgrades, and more.</p><p>Diving into <em>UFO 50 </em>is a wonderfully stimulating and sometimes bracing experience: you come across both the intimately familiar and the unfamiliar, games that require you to take a step back and grapple with their various elements as you come to grips with them. Some players have found this frustrating, or even called it evidence of bad game design. I couldn’t disagree more. Perhaps it’s that I’m old enough to remember the games of the 1980s vividly myself, and to recall how, in that era, running up against mechanics or systems you didn’t immediately understand was commonplace. For me, this process is often part of the fun; it feels like a real process of discovery, tinkering with a game until just how it works and what it’s asking of you becomes clear. It’s a kind of discovery that’s become quite rare in games today, but <em>UFO 50 </em>embraces it.</p><p>Of course, that wouldn’t matter much if the games in <em>UFO 50 </em>weren’t good enough to make all that experimentation worth it, but they are. Particular favorites of mine include <em>Grimstone</em>, a JRPG with an Old West-themed setting; <em>Valbrace</em>, a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG that switches to third-person action for combat; and <em>Barbuta</em>, UFOSoft’s “first” game, a slow-paced, mysterious adventure ostensibly from the early 80s. Each new discovery in <em>Barbuta </em>was a wonderful revelation, and eventually completing it (without looking up hints on the internet) was my most rewarding gaming achievement of the year. Alongside those, I also adored some of <em>UFO 50</em>’s breeziest and most accessible action games: <em>Cyber Owls </em>fuses the thematic zaniness of games like <em>Battletoads</em> to an assortment of gameplay types, from top-down, <em>Metal Gear</em>-esque infiltration to <em>Bad Dudes</em>-style side-scrolling punch’ em up; and <em>Seaside Drive </em>bathes you in glorious, summery vibes as you shoot down everything from attack helicopters to giant, flying wizard-sharks while speeding down a coastal road in a red sports car. <em>UFO 50 </em>is a thrilling reminder of how varied and creative video games can be, and it’s the one game this year that, more than any other, reminded me why I love this medium so much. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-recommend-id="image://772cb70f8a31b29e16f74bbb00e59a6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kay Vess walks toward a pair of Storm Troopers interrogating a civilian." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A key moment I remember distinctly in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span><em> </em>was flying over to Tattooine, landing, and then walking into the famous cantina seen in the original<em> </em>1977 film. Moseying around its iconic bar was incredible. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do since seeing the original film as a kid. And then, I left the bar and kept walking out into the rest of the city. And then past the city. Into the dunes and rocky cliffs; areas never seen in any <em>Star Wars</em> movie or show before. That was maybe even more mind-blowing. Finally, I had a giant, photorealistic recreation of <em>Star Wars</em> and I was free to wander about it, discovering both iconic locations and spots never before seen. That’s when I knew <em>Outlaws</em> was one of my favorite games of 2024.</p><p>Sure, the game’s story is very<em> Star Wars</em>-y and I like it a lot. Yes, the gunplay feels wild and loose in a way that reminds me of the barely choreographed action of the first film. And of course, I adore Nix—your in-game pet. All of that stuff is great. But a lot of <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>isn’t. The forced stealth sections, the space battles, the clunky speeder bike, and the janky open world.</p><p>But whatever, I don’t care about any of that stuff because I was able to mingle through a crowded market on Tatooine and grab some sci-fi street food at a nearby vendor, all while recognizable <em>Star Wars</em> aliens walked by me. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> lets me truly immerse myself in a franchise I love so much, and that’s enough for me. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-recommend-id="image://a3d5c4a07aa23ee2f7ff3dc63978b250" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A comic-like collage depicts someone leaving a baby at a doorstep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Half the games on this list are giant releases that are trying to give you a little bit of everything. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a></span><em> </em>is a bite-sized gem that repeatedly riffs on the same core concept, and doesn’t stick around long enough to trip over itself. Thinking back on developer <em>Furniture &amp; Mattress’</em> sublime puzzle-driven adventure, I think it’s been long enough now since my first playthrough that I no longer remember all the solutions to its environmental puzzles and complex boss fights, and it was so magical the first time through that I’m seriously contemplating a revisit.</p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the type of game that can be described with words but is best understood in motion. There’s something intuitive about how its grid-like paths shuffle around as you move through them. So many of its puzzles can be solved just by feeling your way through its world as it shifts beneath your feet. By the time you’ve spent just a few minutes with <em>Arranger</em>, you come to understand how to navigate its terrain and manipulate it to your needs. One sign of good puzzle design is that you don’t need a giant text bubble to explain it, and <em>Arranger </em>is at its best when it just lets you exist in its ever-moving space and figure it out. Doing so remains one of the most satisfying experiences in the genre, and if the clever puzzles weren’t enough, the heartfelt writing woven into every challenge keeps the world fresh beyond its moving floors. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-recommend-id="image://41192b8691be6ea26a2af158d54b9a53" data-format="jpg" data-width="1329" data-height="747" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A squad is surrounded by enemy alien forces." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some games are overwhelming in their scope and intricacy; others, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, are pretty straightforward but manage to get a ton of mileage out of doing a few things extremely well. Arrowhead Game Studios managed to take a very simple idea—shooting tons of aliens in open fields—and turn it into one of the most tense, funny, and memorable experiences of the year. Other multiplayer games might get in their own way, clogging up the gameplay-to-fun pipeline with all sorts of unnecessary and overcomplicated junk. Not <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>While it’s stayed fresh for almost a full year now thanks to a scary cadence of new updates, patches, and immersive in-game storytelling and content drops, the core appeal is the same as it was on day one: drop down onto a planet, meet some randos, and run, laugh, die together. No other game in recent memory has made scraping through hell and high water feel quite so exhilarating, earned, and enduringly surprising no matter how many times you keep doing it. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is precise, punchy, and endlessly entertaining.

There are fewer people to meet than in the studio’s other games, but <em>Metaphor</em> focuses its energies on establishing a strong thematic throughline that unites the characters, and Atlus achieves that here more effectively than it ever has in the past. Each conversation you have, mission you take on, and battle you face feed into that goal, and it makes every moment of <em>Metaphor </em>feel like it matters in a genre that has typically thrived in the meaningless mundane.</p><p>But its overtly political story of fighting prejudice and injustice isn’t just about being ideologically opposed to those ills. <em>Metaphor</em>’s greatest achievement is in how it manages to weave threads about political activism and fantasy-based escapism together to create a pointed story about how we retreat into fiction when shit gets hard. Even if it’s lacking in subtlety and has its moments of poor judgment (looking at you, Catherina subplot), we need stories like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>when things are bad. We can’t retreat into fiction and call it activism, but we can use it as inspiration and encouragement for the real action we must take. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->LocalThunk</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-recommend-id="image://626ae449663028840a290d83c01b7cd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Balatro table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poker sims have been a stalwart of gaming for as long as I can remember, going back as far as those pixelated demos on magazine coverdiscs for <em>Deluxe Strip Poker II</em>.

Surely it at least came out in 2023! But no, its triumphant release was indeed in February of 2024, and it’s certainly been the one game I’ve come back to most frequently since.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> takes the rogue-ish elements of a deckbuilder like <em>Slay the Spire</em>, but puts them into a deck made up of traditional playing cards, eschewing all the usual dressings of a fantasy setting. It’s poker rules, kinda, except where in the right conditions you can make a straight with just four cards and that skips over a number. Or the much-coveted five-of-a-kind.</p><p>Something that most interests me about <em>Balatro</em> is how—aside from wrinkles introduced by the numerous rule-changing Jokers that can be found—the main adjustment that’s made to your game between attempts is within <em>you</em>, rather than via a tweaked deck. You get better at it. You develop new tactics and approaches, adapting on the fly based on the opportunities that come your way on any given run, and inevitably grow more skilful. That’s so much more rewarding than the game essentially getting easier because of unlocks you added, as is often the case in this genre.</p><p>It’s also stupidly clicky, and the “one more go” factor registers dangerously high.

Somehow, <em>The Veilguard</em> manages to pull off all of the above with a level of refinement not seen in anything BioWare has done before. <em>The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">has been divisive</a></span>, but even so, here I am, writing about it as #2 on our 2024 Game of the Year list.</p><p>I came into <em>The Veilguard</em> jaded, feeling that BioWare had lost the plot in its constant attempts to make <em>Dragon Age </em>an anthology series, each with a different protagonist, even as it focused on presenting a world influenced by your heroes and their decisions. Some of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s greatest failings are in its inability to marry an anthology structure with the choice and consequence BioWare has become synonymous with, but what it loses in a lack of carryover from decade-old games—importing only a handful of decisions from its direct predecessor—it makes up for in being probably the best foundation for a brighter future the series has had since <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p><p><em>The Veilguard</em> is all about wrapping up loose ends and paving the way for the next generation of <em>Dragon Age </em>heroes. Some of the game’s most moving moments are ones in which it feels like you’re watching an origin story unfold as the heroes of before pass the torch to the next young whippersnapper doomed to save the world.

But despite how much wonderful specificity and detail you can bring to your own Rook, their story is universal for long-time fans of BioWare’s fantasy series. It’s not all great, as there’s an unnerving sense at times that Rook isn’t the one who should be here to watch history be uncovered. But the long-hidden truths they unearth about the world of Thedas are by turns satisfying, thrilling, and shocking, and <em>The Veilguard </em>manages to wield the uncertainty about Rook’s worthiness to pave the way for one of BioWare’s best finales.</p><p>Each tale it tells on the way to its climactic battle, whether it be Neve Gallus fighting for the city she loves or Davrin uncovering Grey Warden history, feels like a fresh start for this world. Given <em>Dragon Age</em>’s past, it’s hard to tell if <em>The Veilguard </em>is setting the series up to finally shed the weight of its long, overarching lore, or if it is ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-rook-choice-import-da5-5-1851705496">finally use it to its advantage with more forethought</a></span>. But for the moment, <em>The Veilguard </em>did exactly what it needed to do. It put BioWare back on track with <em>Dragon Age</em> to do what it does best: create worlds for us to inhabit and define who our heroes are.

But even constrained by familiar frameworks, <em>Astro Bot</em> works tirelessly to insert clever ideas and extract maximum satisfaction from them before quickly moving onto the next carefully crafted setpiece. The results can sometimes be so effortless, it almost feels like you’re gliding through the game rather than actually playing it. And that’s when Astro Bot gets smashed, zapped, or popped, waking you from your comfortable slumber so that you can experience the delight of eventually slipping back into the game’s well-worn grooves like a marble gliding through a Rube Goldberg machine made from bubble gum plastic and fond memories. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed: Johnny Silverhand and ‘V’ from Cyberpunk 2077 are heading to Fortnite soon. It seems bizarre that a character who was iconic for rebelling against corporations and consumerism would appear in a game like this, but here we are. It hasn’t been confirmed when the characters will arrive in Fortnite, but it should be soon.</p>



<p>In a short teaser uploaded on social media, Epic Games revealed the characters – the female variant of V, and the standard model of Johnny Silverhand, who Keanu Reeves famously played in the 2020 open-world RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-city-meet-fortnite">Night City, Meet Fortnite</h2>



<p>This will be the second time that Keanu Reeves has appeared in Fortnite. In 2019, the actor was introduced to the Fortnite universe as John Wick, arguably one of his most famous roles to date, beyond playing Neo in The Matrix franchise.</p>



<p>He’ll surface in Fortnite as Johnny Silverhand, one of the most major characters in Cyberpunk 2077 and the catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the game. Also being added is ‘V’, the game’s protagonist. While neither gender is canonical, Epic Games has opted to include the female variant in the upcoming crossover.</p>



<div><article><p><span>We’re expecting some guests from Night City 🌆 </span></p></article></div>







<p>It’s not yet confirmed what’s coming in the bundle, but we’ve seen snippets online showing Cyberpunk 2077’s ‘Mantis Blade’ weapons as a pickaxe replacement.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hjz19e/cyberpunk_x_fortnite_collab_skins_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a leak on other social media platforms</a>, the character models were reportedly revealed, along with the blades, a back bling, and weapon wraps.</p>



<p>Will you be securing something from the Cyberpunk x Fortnite crossover? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-feybreak-update-introduces-meowmeow-from-terraria/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Palworld’s Feybreak update has arrived with v0.4.11, and it introduces a new weapon called Meowmeow as the first instalment of their Terraria collab. The update also introduces a new island, fresh features, areas, pals, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-meowmeow-is-a-bullet-firing-melee-weapon-nbsp">Palworld’s Meowmeow is a “Bullet Firing Melee Weapon”&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Through the Feybreak update, players can now try out Meowmeow from Terraria in Palworld. This is a “small tease of the collab,” with more to come in 2025. For those wondering, this “Bullet Firing Melee Weapon” is actually a sword that makes cat sounds when you attack. When the player swings the blade, a cat projectile with a rainbow trajectory is thrown at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-feybreak-island-new-mechanics-and-more">Feybreak Island, New Mechanics and More</h2>



<p>The next big part of the Palworld update is the Feybreak Island itself, a land filled with new mysteries, challenges and goals. Additionally, there’s a new faction that you need to look for on this island, the Feybreak Warriors. These pesky individuals have taken over the island with the power of their missile battery camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The update has also added new mechanics such as Expeditions, Research, Predator Pals, and Bounty NPCs. Players also receive a new raid called Xenolord, where they must defeat a mechanical dragon controlling the Xeno army. There’s also a Random Pal mode that randomises Pal Spawns. You can filter it by region or keep it entirely random for some chaos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld Feybreak update adds much more content, such as the ability to create new weapons, the addition of new strongholds and stronghold bosses, items, unique skills, player changes, increased cap level, bug fixes, and so on.

<p>That's according to creative director Jonathan Dumont, who told <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696">Entertainment Weekly</a> that she will have a Naruto run in which she'll "lean forward, arms bent, sprinting at full speed".</p>

<p>"Naoe's the fastest Assassin we ever made," he added. "She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn't have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game."</p><p>Dumont wouldn't be drawn on further story points, but did say: "She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught.</p>
<p>"Can she make a better world? [She realises] they are people who cannot defend themselves, which is tied a little bit more to the models of the [Assassin] Brotherhood.</p>
<p>"[Naoe] was shielded by her father from what's happening in the world, and it comes crashing down," Dumont added. "She is pushed into war. She doesn't know much about her origins. Her father's been training her, but she doesn't know much about her mother, who's been gone. But as a cool proverb from Japan says, 'a frog in a well knows nothing of the sea'.</p>
<p>"She is tossed into the real world, and through that, she will learn that she is not just a shinobi, that there is a little bit of a lineage or at least some mystery about some sort of different type of shinobi. They're Assassins, so she's somewhat linked to that."</p>
<p>It's from her father, Dumont said, that Naoe receives her Hidden Blade.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whilst Naoe is super stealthy and can pull off the signature Leap of Faith if there's a handy pile of shrubbery or hay nearby, co-lead Yakuke can't.</p>
<p>"He doesn't do the Leap of Faith," Dumont said. "He just crashes right into the haystack, and he hurts his butt, too. So, it's pretty funny."</p>
<p>This dual perspective is to ensure fans of both the older and newer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> are satisfied.</p>
<p>"A lot of people like Assassin's at the start with the stealth approach: hiding in the shadows and the crowd. Then we have a little bit more of the action-oriented ones... Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla," Dumont added. "We try to satisfy both types of players, but also try to not dilute too much of what they like about it."</p>
<p>We also recently learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story and offer a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".</p>
<p>In answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Dumont revealed the game would feature a "canon mode"</a>.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-double-xp-week-event/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a Double XP sweep starting tomorrow, December 24. Although it hasn’t been announced by Treyarch (or any Activision studio), there’s a listing for a Double XP event on the Black Ops 6 menu, and it says it’s starting tomorrow. This will be the latest in a long line of such events that have run since the game dropped in October.</p>



<p>Some could argue that Treyarch has put on <strong>too many </strong>Double XP events, reducing the efficacy of the ‘special period’ that allows players to get more out of their grind. Others have argued that the Double XP events are ‘fixed’ and that they don’t offer the full boost of experience points you’d expect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-xp-incoming">More XP Incoming</h2>



<p>The next Black Ops 6 Double XP event is set to start tomorrow, December 24. That’s per a placeholder on the Black Ops 6 menu – it’s yet to be announced by Activision.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has started struggling in recent weeks, ebbing away from the claims that it’s the ‘best Call of Duty game in years’, and that’s mostly because the title is <strong>plagued </strong>with cheaters. It was admitted by the Call of Duty team that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">they ‘missed the mark’</a> with the game’s anti-cheat mechanic, which means it’s hard for anyone to have any faith in the product right now.</p>



<p>To that end, some pro players and streamers have started abandoning Black Ops 6 in favour of other games. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/">Nadeshot gave up on streaming</a> Black Ops 6 and relocated to Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>In any case, Black Ops 6 is getting a new Double XP event from tomorrow, December 24. It comes at a time when many new players – the age-old ‘Christmas noobs’ – will be joining the ecosystem. However, thanks to SBMM – which definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-black-ops-6-have-sbmm-answered/">exists in Black Ops 6</a> – you won’t bump into them unless you’re pretty awful at the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A recent report suggested that Sega, the Japanese gaming giant, could produce a standalone game subscription service based on the extensive library it has built up over the years. This would likely see its games withdrawn from similar subscription schemes live today, capitalising on the growth of the operating model.</p>



<p>The gaming world is no stranger to such service. Today, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Rockstar Games, PlayStation, and Xbox all offer gaming-based subscription programs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undisclosed">Undisclosed</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a>, Sega’s president, Shuji Utsumi, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thinking something – and discussing something – we cannot disclose right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was talking about subscription-based products, and reportedly mentioned that they’re ‘very interesting’ and that Sega is ‘evaluating some opportunities’.</p>



<p>These days, the average gamer is surrounded by subscription-based schemes, and the rise of the live-service game has meant that we’re all putting money into a pot every few weeks over a long period, rather than paying for something once and then never again.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most common operating models in the gaming world right now.</p>



<p>Between Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, some 80 million gamers worldwide are subscribed to a service that delivers free games every month and gives them access to repositories filled with games both old and new. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has a service that operates in much the same way, as does Electronic Arts with EA Play.</p>



<p>Sega entering the subscription market might not be the move everyone had on their cards, but why shouldn’t it? It’s free game and the market is wide open for such schemes right now.</p>



<p>Sega has been running since the 1960s, and in the 1990s, it really dominated the gaming industry. There are <strong>a lot </strong>of classic franchises sitting in that Sega library that would flesh out a subscription service quite nicely.</p>

<p>A reputable movie insider has said that more Indiana Jones games are in development.</p>



<p>That’s according to DanielRPK, who <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1870926309842473117?t=nxgc-3ez5wVn75-3JoS6Hg&amp;s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>, “Looks like we’re getting more Indy games.”</p>



<p>While there isn’t much to go on at face value, DanielRPK has had a knack for getting some tidbits from movies and games over the years, so his comment should suggest that some projects could have been greenlit behind the scenes.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s only been two weeks since the Indiana Jones and The Great Circle released, so whether or not the game’s positive reception and/or sales led to more games being approved remains to be seen.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though – if the games were approved recently, we’re likely several years away from seeing another released.</p>



<p>The game description for Indiana Jones and The Great Circle reads, “Uncover one of history’s greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™, a first-person, single-player adventure set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark™ and The Last Crusade™. Get ready to don your fedora and whip as you step into the shoes of the legendary archaeologist — Indiana Jones™. Embark on an epic globetrotting adventure in a race against enemy forces to uncover the secrets of the mysterious Great Circle.”</p>

We’re talking this year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Dead Space fans, EA said it wasn’t interested, with Schofield suggesting projections for how many copies Dead Space 4 would have to sell to make the venture worthwhile were perhaps a key factor in the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t go too deep,” Schofield explained. “They just said, ‘We're not interested right now. We appreciate it blah blah blah, and you know we know who to talk to.’ So we didn't take it any further. And we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that so yeah.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stone added that the video game industry’s high-profile struggles and its subsequent risk aversion has made projects such as Dead Space 4 a particularly hard sell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The industry is in a weird place right now,” Stone said. “People are really hesitant to take chances on things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-significant-improvements-final-fantasy-xvi-xiv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost mode can bring significant improvements in terms of image quality and performance even in games that haven't been patched to take advantage of all the system's features, a new analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In a new video shared over the weekend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at how the current-generation Final Fantasy games run on the mid-generation system released last month. Being the only PS5 Pro Enhanced title, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is clearly the star of the show. In the new Versatility Mode only available on PlayStation 5 Pro, the second entry in the Remake series features improved image clarity and more stable performance over Performance Mode in pretty much every scenario. In combination with a small resolution boost over the base model, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler delivers some impressive results, although with some issues that are unique to the game, such as vegetation issues both at a distance and up close, and common among games using the current iteration of the upscaler, which should become a thing of the past in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">future versions</a>.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting with the other current-generation Final Fantasy games, as none of them have received PlayStation 5 Pro patches. Final Fantasy XVI, for example, shows significant improvements in both display modes. In Graphics mode, for example, Game Boost Mode allows the game to run at a higher internal resolution, which results in clearer and more detailed image. Performance Mode sports a far smaller internal resolution boost but considerably more stable performance with a 24% uplift, which often falls into the system's VRR range. In scenarios where the base model struggles to hit 60 FPS, the PS5 Pro manages to do so consistently. In addition, the game's combination of TSC MAA and FSR 1 leaves much of the image pixel structure intact, resulting in less aliasing on the mid-generation system.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV improvements are more significant on the PlayStation 5 Pro with Game Boost, with an up to 40% performance improvement in 4K mode with dynamic resolution off. On the new system, the game manages to hit 60 FPS consistently, and only the most intense scenarios cause drops. At 1440p resolution, the game also often manages to hit 120 FPS, resulting in great image fluidity. Even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins sports more stable performance on the PlayStation 5 Pro without a dedicated patch, which is a significant improvement for an intense action game like the spin-off developed by Team NINJA.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro offers a variety of new features over the base model, which make it a compelling upgrade for those looking to experience console games at their best despite its high price.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/every-major-fallout-4-faction-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-major-fallout-4-faction-ranked.1067862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/every-major-fallout-4-faction-ranked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout 4 has some fantastic factions that make up the backbone of the game itself – without them, there would essentially be no story for the player to experience. However, there’s a point of contention within the community as to which Fallout 4 faction is ‘the best’. It’s mostly a subjective debate, but in this list, we’re seeing every major Fallout 4 faction ranked from worst to best. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ranking-fallout-4-s-factions">Ranking Fallout 4’s Factions</h2>



<p>Out of all the Fallout 4 factions, we’ve zeroed in on the ‘main’ groups that contribute the most to the story, so don’t be disappointed if your all-time favourite fringe faction doesn’t make the cut. Leave a comment stressing who you think should make the list and we’ll consider adding it!</p>



<p>Here we go – every major Fallout 4 faction, ranked <strong>from worst to best</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-railroad-worst">4. The Railroad (Worst)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Railroad might have some admirable goals in mind, but this basement-dwelling, secretive organisation that distrusts the player from the word ‘go’ is typically left standing in the nuclear dust in Fallout 4. They only care about helping synths, and that’s a huge sticking point for much of the Commonwealth. </p>



<p>There’s a sweet bonus in the ‘Ballistic Fiber’ mod you can unlock for siding with The Railroad, but it’s enough to save the faction.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-the-institute">3. The Institute</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Institute – arguably the most important Fallout 4 faction because of where it fits into the story, but it’s called ‘The Boogeyman of the Commonwealth’ for a reason. It terrifies people, and some of the experiments it carries out are nothing short of abhorrent. With that being said, the whole ‘preservation of science and rebuilding the world’ bit is positive and a huge redeemer for the faction.</p>



<p>There’s a huge amount of work needed in The Institute’s PR department, but the upkeep of a hyper-clean, flawless scientific facility some 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse is something that can’t be discredited.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Honourable Mention: Gunners</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>In Fallout 4, the Gunners are akin to the Raiders, but they’re more military-based in their appearance and how they operate, and they facilitate the backstory of one of the game’s best companions, MacCready. They often pair up with the likes of Assaultrons and bring the force of a well-trained unit to any fight.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-brotherhood-of-steel">2. Brotherhood of Steel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Brotherhood of Steel is easily the most recognisable Fallout 4 faction – it’s probably the most iconic faction from the franchise, period. In Fallout 4, the Brotherhood of Steel ‘chapter’ that arrives to shape up Boston is unfortunately quite bigoted and fascist-like in how it goes about its mission, but there’s something valiant about wanting to rid an entire region of mutated, cannibalistic, and intensely violent creatures, right?</p>



<p>As a special mention, it’s worth stressing that their arrival in the Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most epic moments in Fallout history.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-honourable-mention-atom-cats"><em>Honourable Mention: Atom Cats</em></h3>



<p><em>No Fallout 4 faction is cooler than the Atom Cats. They’re a real live bunch, you dig? With their customised suits of power armour and their ‘Greased Lightning’ vibe, they’re instantly likeable and probably way more chilled out than they should be, given their surroundings.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-minutemen-best">1. Minutemen (Best)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As we see every major Fallout 4 faction ranked, we can’t help but list the Minutemen at the top of the pile. This selfless faction exists to unite settlements across the Wasteland, pulling together with community spirit and ensuring that everyone has a voice – and a home. There’s no sinister sub-plot, no underlying regime – it’s just regular folks trying to get by and share what they have with those that need it.</p>



<p>Out of every major Fallout 4 faction, the Minutemen are deserving of the top spot. They might not boast vertibirds or next-generation scientific technology, but they’re decent people, and they’re triers, and that’s all that matters. </p>

<p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield has said that the team tried to pitch Dead Space 4 earlier this year, but the publisher was not interested.</p>



<p>The news came from a live stream by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM&amp;t=5476s&amp;ab_channel=DanAllenGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dan Allen Gaming</a> a few weeks ago, where he sat down with Dead Space creators Glen Schofield, Bret Robbins, and Cristopher Stone.</p>



<p>“We tried actually, the three of us, to [pitch] Dead Space 4, said Schofield. “I mean, we’re talking this year [that they pitched Dead Space 4]”, he continued. In response, Allen replied, “And what they didn’t budge?”</p>



<p>“Well, we didn’t go too deep; they just said we’re not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and we respected their opinion,” replied Schofield. He finished on the topic with “We have some ideas,” with the trio all saying they would return for a Dead Space 4. </p>



<p>The last game in the Dead Space series to be released was Dead Space 3 in 2013, with the original Dead Space receiving a remake by Motive Studio in 2022. </p>



<p>Since the Dead Space IP stopped with its game in 2023, Schofield released The Callisto Protocol in 2022 with his new studio Striking Distance Studios, which was considered a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series. The game failed to meet Krafton’s sales expectations of five million units, lowering their expectations to two million.</p>



<p>As for if we’ll ever see another Dead Space, it remains to be seen, but for now, it looks like its creators are all on board with jumping ship to EA if the project gets greenlit.</p>

            <p>Another copycat video game has popped up on Nintendo's eShop in China, this time a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> imitation.</p>
<p>Just days after the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, Chinese fans have spotted a game called Wukong Sun: Black Legend has popped up, too.</p>
<p>Set to release on Boxing Day, 26th December, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/">2D platformer</a>'s gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/">promotional art</a> and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p>

<p>As Black Myth: Wukong is one of China's most notable video game releases in recent years, many Chinese fans have taken to social media to share their frustration at "malicious developers exploit[ing] the names of well-known games".</p>
<p>"Well-known games have been plagued by imitations for a long time," wrote <a href="https://weibo.com/6004281123/P68YRsu0O?refer_flag=1001030103_">Pear Video</a> (via <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-internet-upset-black-myth-wukong-similarities-nintendo-store-2024-12">BusinessInsider</a>).</p>
<p>"Malicious developers exploit the names of well-known games, reskin various small games, and put them on the shelves of big game stores with similar titles, deceiving uninformed consumers to buy and download."</p>

<p>Here in the UK, a September 2024 release called <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Wukong-s-Child-Monkey-King-Myth-2657748.html">Wukong's Child: Monkey King Myth</a> could similarly be confused with Game Science's game, which released in August.</p>
<p>As yet, neither Nintendo nor Wukong Sun: Black Legend publisher Global Game Studio have commented publicly on the issue.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji recently posted a lengthy statement following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-producer-on-the-game-awards-top-prize-snub-i-came-all-the-way-here-for-nothing">action game's apparent snub for the top prize at this year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
<p>"The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can't figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!" he wrote in a post on Weibo, even though Black Myth: Wukong did come away with the Best Action Game and Players' Voice awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch is now live on PC, addressing some crashing issues and a few other issues.</p>
<p>The 1.1.3 patch, which has been confirmed to be the last patch of the year for the game, is considerably smaller than the previous patch in both size and scope. Weighting around 7.4 GB, the patch focuses on fixing a small selection of issues, introducing a temporary solution to avoid crashes on shader compilation by skipping shaders warm up, as well as addressing a few access violation error crashes, an issue when invert axis options could not be saved after restarting the game and another issue where controls could be lost after shooting, reloading and then examing the artifact. The detailed patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525330030617690996?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new STALKER 2 patch is much smaller in scope than the previous one, which addressed over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/">1800 issues</a>, improved the A-Life system, and improved optimization, among other things. Performance was also improved on RTX 3000 series cards with AMD frame generation, although the minor improvements show how there's still plenty of work to be done in this regard.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC World by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

Check out the patch notes, below, for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feybreak arrives as developer Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. However, without explanation, Pocketpair recently tweaked how players summon Pals, with observers speculating the change had to do with the patent infringement lawsuit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5, albeit after a short delay in Japan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on the lawsuit to see who will emerge victorious, if it isn't settled first. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, however, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Pocketpair has continued to release major updates for Palworld and Feybreak is just the latest example of that. The developer is even moving forward with crossovers with other huge video games, including the start of a Terraria collaboration with today's release of Feybreak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld Feybreak update 0.4.11 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>▼New Content<br>・Meowmere from Terraria!<br>⤷ Meowmere, the first "bullet-firing melee weapon" in Palworld, has been added.

            <p>
Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s female V are both set to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
The crossover is expected to go live tonight, with the characters and various accessories available to buy in the game's shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games confirmed the crossover and showed off the appearance of the characters within Fortnite yesterday, in a post on social media that teased: "We're expecting some guests from Night City."

<p>
It's perhaps not surprising to see Cyberpunk 2077 turn up in Fortnite - its developer CD Projekt Red has forged close ties with Epic Games through its switch to Unreal Engine for future development (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">first trailer for The Witcher 4</a>, and our first look at The Witcher's world in Unreal, debuted this month at The Game Awards). And the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-4-starts-tomorrow-with-geralt-and-doomslayer">Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri all joined Fortnite previously</a>.
</p><p>
Fun fact: this will be Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite, after his previous addition as John Wick. But he's not the first actor to get into the game twice. Zendaya (in her Spider-Man and Dune guises) and Harrison Ford (as both Han Solo and Indiana Jones) have also previously found their way into Fortnite more than once.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest additions come amidst a typically-busy end of year season for the game. Its Winterfest event is now on offering daily free cosmetic rewards (leading up to a Santa Snoop Dogg skin on Christmas day), heralded by the in-game arrival of Mariah Carey from a giant block of ice. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-and-plungerman-plop-into-fortnite">Skibidi Toilet is now in the game too</a>.

        <p>Key members of original dev team say they were ready and willing to make a sequel.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA reportedly rejected proposals to create a brand new Dead Space game.</p>
<p>Glen Schofield - who directed the original game and went on to co-found both Sledgehammer Games and Callisto Protocol studio, Striking Distance - said that EA shut down a proposal for "Dead Space 4", saying it wasn't "interested right now".</p>
<p>The news follows EA's launch of the critically-acclaimed Dead Space Remake in January 2023, but uncertainty over the franchise's future.</p>

<p>"We tried actually, you know, the three of us. We tried Dead Space 4," Schofield said in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/cU5PrEr1HjM?t=5480">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, alongside his former colleagues, creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. "We're talking this year."</p><p>"We didn't go too deep. They just said, no, we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and you know, we know who to talk to, so we didn't take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so..."</p>
<p>"All three of us sat down and wanted to do it," Stone added. "The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you've got to take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've got some ideas," Schofield teased.</p>
<p>When asked by Allen if they'd really return to the horror series, Stone said: "I'd make a Dead Space 4," and Schofield simply said: "Yes."</p>
<p>When Bret Robbins didn't say anything, Schofield pointed out that Robbins had "a good game going" given he was "having a great time" working with Dan Houser at Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, rumours swirled that despite the Dead Space Remake's critical acclaim, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-series-reportedly-on-ice-following-sequel-remake-rumours">whole series was reportedly "on ice"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
