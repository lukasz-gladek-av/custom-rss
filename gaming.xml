AC Shadows’ PC specifications have been segregated according to three presets: selective ray tracing, standard ray tracing and extended ray tracing, each with its minimum and recommended set of requirements.&nbsp;Players should know that 16GB RAM, SSD storage and Windows 10/11 with DirectX12 are mandatory for all presets</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/doritos-are-getting-a-creeper-flavour-to-promote-the-minecraft-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
After partnerships with Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Mountain Dew, Doritos' next video game promotion is the upcoming live-action/CGI Minecraft Movie starring Jason "Aquaman" Momoa and Jack "Tenacious D is on hold" Black.
</p>
<p>
Two new flavours are being rolled out - so you can finally find out what a Minecraft Creeper, and also a Ghast, taste like as a processed corn snack.
</p>
<p>
A press release today trumpets the fact that Doritos are also changing their shape for first time. Yes, the triangluar treat is turning square. But this will only be the case for a rare 100 packs - and if you find one, you win a £10k prize.

<p>
"Creeper Vinegar delivers a zesty, explosive flavour," Doritos said in a press release, describing its new flavour. Apparently, it is "reminiscent of the sneaky green creatures that lurk in the shadows". 
</p>
<p>
Ghast BBQ, meanwhile, "offers a sweet and tangy taste". 
</p>
<p>
So, basically salt and vinegar and then sweet chili.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft Movie is set to arrive in cinemas on 4th April</a>, and it looks... yeah. Jack Black plays default Minecraft man Steve, in a blocky CGI world that looks like Mojang's simulation put through an AI filter.
</p>
<p>
I'll give the salt and vinegar flavour a go, anyway.

            <p>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South Of Midnight</a> sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.</p>

<p>It's coming out April 8th. The trailer was part of yesterday's Xbox Developer Direct, and it shows a little more of the protagonist's motives, as well as the mythical and human figures who will both help and hinder her. We catch a glimpse of Huggin' Molly, for example. A <a href="https://www.spiritshack.co.uk/blog/ghost-stories/huggin-molly/">legend of Abbeville, Alabama</a>, Molly is a ghostly (and again, tall) figure who is said to stalk any kid out late at night. She will grab, hug, and scream at you if she catches you. I don't see the problem. Sounds like a normal granny to me.</p>
<p>This trailer marks the third big glimpse we've had of the marshy misadventure. One previous trailer showed us how the player will bash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witchy-swampy-action-adventure-south-of-midnight-gets-a-proper-gameplay-trailer-with-island-sized-alligators">a big-armed miniboss bozo</a>, and fly across the bog in the company of crows. While the release announcement introduced us to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-happy-few-devs-reveal-south-of-midnight-a-new-action-adventure-set-in-a-magical-realist-american-south">long-limbed guitar player called Shakin' Bones</a>. If you're really desperate to follow more of the development, developers Compulsion Games have also made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLBOyKqw58A">a 30-minute "making of" video</a> that talks more about the music, influences, and ideas behind the story.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Compulsion are the studio who made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-happy-few">We Happy Few</a>, a first-person survival dystopia with some creepy character design and a strong theme (alternate history Britain in the 1960s where everyone is on drugs). But it was also a little jumbled when it came to actually playing through the story, said John in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-we-happy-few">our review</a>. I'm still keen to get my hands on this new swamp-and-slash of theirs though. The music alone seems worth a look. Or a listen. You know what I mean.</p><p>Meanwhile the Xbox show also revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 remake</a> that was released immediately onto Steam (haha, what). And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-may-15th-2025-heres-everything-we-learned-from-ids-press-show">a release date for Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, which is also coming out in Spring. That's good. Let this long winter end. Let the games flow forth.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I’ve really enjoyed my gaming time this week. Whether it’s been jumping into some co-op in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review-beauty-and-a-beast/">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, or taking down some Orcs in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, it’s been fun to catch up with friends while taking out a variety of ugly badniks. I’ve also reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/20/freedom-wars-remastered-review/">Freedom Wars Remastered</a>, and taken a look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-just-how-far-mobile-gaming-has-come/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> too. Alongside that, I’ve replaced the battery in my 3DS and been playing around with Fire Emblem Awakening, Animal Crossing: New Leaf (of course I immediately received a letter from Winnie to say she’d left sometime in the 8 years since I last played it), and Project X Zone. There’s a bunch of stuff on my account that I only have a minimal memory of too, so that’ll be a fun diversion in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>First up, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. This is little surprise, I know. Meanwhile, <strong>Jason</strong> joined me for some Hyper Light Breaker and Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, but mostly it’s been Heroes of Hammerwatch 2, calling it, “The one true game of the year so far.” I think he likes it, and you’ll catch his review later today.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> finally finished off the main quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance which ends rather abruptly and on a rather obvious cliffhanger. He tells us, “I was tempted to mop up a few of the outlying side quests but figured I’d already spent plenty of time in Bohemia and will no doubt revisit once I get my hands on the sequel.”</p>
<p>That’s not all though, as he moved onto the next on his backlog, Alan Wake 2. He says, “I remember being excited for the original game back on Xbox 360 but didn’t have the same appreciation for its media and literary inspirations at the time, namely Twin Peaks. The sequel is exactly what you’d expect from a survival horror game in a post-RE2 remake world, albeit fuelled by a mind-bending plot that feels like its own autonomous being, giving itself permission to fuse Alan Wake with Remedy’s other video game worlds.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing the brilliant Unicorn Overlord, saying, “I’ve just reached the halfway point and have loved every minute so far! As a big fan of Fire Emblem, Unicorn Overlord’s combo of strategy, characterisation, and stat tinkering has had me hooked.” He continues, “I’ve also played Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter for review, which you can read my thoughts about this coming Monday. Oh! And my partner and I are nearing the end game of Sea of Stars – a fantastic old-school RPG with excellent local co-op, highly recommended!”</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> week has seen him play more The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. He tells us, “I have decided out of every open world game I have ever experienced, nothing comes close to exploring the Skellige Isles. It is a combo of the scenery and music that makes it click so well. My gaming will come to an abrupt end after this weekend as I’m jetting off to Japan for a few weeks, and I will be seeing if I can find any treasures out there.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been switching between modern indie and classic 360 gaming with my Gears of War journey continuing with the second game. He says, “I’ve been thoroughly enjoying my time with it and it’s a massive improvement over the first with some spectacular setpieces. I did encounter some horrific screeching crashes which seem to be fixed by turning off the FPS boost feature so hoping to get it finished soon.” That’s not all that’s been on his screen though,&nbsp; “Alongside the adventures of Dom and Marcus I’ve been enjoying some top-down Resident Evil homage with the excellent Dead of Darkness, a smidgeon of sci-fi Metroidvania with a classical mythology twist in Somber Echoes and some strategic adventuring with Stone of Madness. The range of styles and sheer quality in indie gaming continues to astound me.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has&nbsp;been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-remaster-review/">Star Wars Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles Remastered</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and Cuisineer for review—also a bit of Phasmophobia and Dying Light.</p>
<p>And finally&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been joining me for bouts of Orcs Must Die: Deathtrap, alongside some Assetto Corsa EVO as it makes its first steps into Early Access, and has been getting on with our review of Sniper Elite: Resistance.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have </em>you<em> played?</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection, including one not seen in the west before.</p>
<p>The Mario maker promises "puzzles, brawls and ninjas galore" with these latest editions, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sutte Hakkun</li>
<li>Fatal Fury 2</li>
<li>Super Ninja Boy</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a little trailer for the three games, to give you a taste of what's in store.</p>

<p>Fatal Fury 2 is a SNES port of SNK's arcade fighting game. Will you choose to fight as Terry Bogard, or his younger brother Andy? Or perhaps wrestling as Big Bear is more your thing.</p>
<p>As for Sutte Hakkun, it's this chap's first official time in the west. It's a cute looking puzzler, where players control a little bird-like creature who can suck up liquids of different colours and then inject that liquid into once-colourless blocks to move them in different directions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/24/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-the-ultimate-extraction-experience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I have not been able to stop thinking about Synduality Echo of Ada since I started playing it. When I wake up, I think of doing a quick run to get those last few cables I need to upgrade my crafting station. While I’m working, I think about what I should equip to deal with the snow bandits in the South Map reliably. As soon as I finish work, I hop onto the game and spend hours hunting resources, creatures, and other players. For years, I’ve been clamouring for a game that scratches that Escape From Tarkov-inspired&nbsp;extraction-shooter itch I’ve never had properly scratched. For Synduality Echo of Ada to not only grant that wish, but bundle it in with mecha combat, customisable characters, and rewarding base upgrades feels like all of my favourite things about gaming rolled up into one package.</p>
<p><iframe title="SYNDUALITY Echo of Ada - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6Zjh8O7JnM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Funnily enough, Synduality Echo of Ada isn’t just a standalone game release – it’s part of a wider Synduality multi-media franchise that kicked off in Japan a couple of years ago with the release of the anime Synduality: Noir. You won’t need to brush up on what happens in that anime to enjoy this game, though, and that’s for a couple reasons. For one, this game is set a few decades before that anime. For another, though, there’s only a whisper of storytelling happening in this game regardless. An intro cutscene sets you up as being a faceless mech-piloting contractor called a Drifter, who operates in a post-post apocalypse world alongside your own humanoid AI Magus companion. Once that’s set up, you’re tossed into your dilapidated garage of a base, told to start gathering resources, and so it goes.</p>


<p>Synduality Echo of Ada is much more about telling and discovering your own story, and it’ll often be a story of scraping by on a wish and a prayer – or not scraping by at all. As an extraction shooter, your goal is simple (on paper) – customise your loadout of weapons and consumables at home, then launch into a massive map at a randomised location. Your only mandatory goal is to find one of several extraction elevators and get out alive. Whatever happens between those two points is up to you – in the beginning, you’ll probably just want to get straight to that elevator and survive. Two major things stand in the way of that, though – roaming monsters, and other roaming pilots. There’s a pretty basic handful of monster varieties in the game that repeat frequently, but I appreciated the fact that this repetition made it easy to start learning how to navigate around them or consistently target their weak points.</p>
<p>Pilots are a whole other story, though. In Synduality Echo of Ada, you are never alone on the map. Some major locations will have AI bandits roaming around that are tough to deal with, but you’ll also have other real players out in the field alongside you. Typically, an encounter with another player leads to the two of you hitting the “Wave” emote and hopping up and down a few times before going your separate ways. There’s trepidation from both parties to engage in any kind of combat in a situation like this, since – as per extraction shooter rules – dying means losing everything you’re carrying. Whoever survives a theoretical PvP bout gets to loot their destroyed foe’s goods, though, and even take their mech parts.</p>


<p>On one occasion, I was deep in the city ruins, wearing my basic starter weapons and mech parts. I passed by another player whose back was turned to me, their attention focused on a box they were looting. My trigger finger moved before my brain could think. I blasted them in the back with a couple of shotgun rounds, and they swivelled around to desperately spray a few machine gun rounds in my general direction. A third shotgun shell smacked against their frame. I was locked in. They were turned back around and sped as far away from me as possible. I swapped to my machine gun and plucked rounds into them as they got further and further away, but not far enough to survive that last round. I ran to their deathbox to see what the spoils of my bloodshed were, and I discovered a rare mech set that could fetch me over half a million in-game credits if I could get it back home alive. I grabbed everything, sprinted to an elevator, and waved sheepishly at any other player I encountered.</p>
<p>I felt things I’ve never felt before in that moment of playing Synduality Echo of Ada.</p>
<p>The fact that loss matters so much in this game makes every run so immediately important and visceral. And with so many reasons to do a run, you’ll naturally have some goal to work towards each time you dive in. Requests pour in from various factions that reward you with new gear and Magus clothing items upon success, but you’ve also got dozens of rooms and features in your run-down homebase that you can build and upgrade by collecting and crafting materials. Eventually, you’ll unlock the ability to start a co-up crew with players who you meet in the field, which will spawn a huge boss monster you can fight together for some randomized rewards. There’s even a full single-player mode to unlock that acts as a psuedo story-mode, giving you a pre-built mech and Magus to tackle bespoke missions with and collect documents tying into the lore of the Synduality universe.</p>
<p>I’ve got to talk about the Magus. Your AI companion can be customized visually from head-to-toe, and the base unit you choose also indicates their personality and how they’ll talk to you. Believe me, they talk a lot. Your Magus will be hanging out all the time in your base when you’re not exploring, and when you are exploring, they’re floating by your side and regularly calling out nearby resources, gunfire in the distance, other players, incoming deadly weather, and more. There’s a constant stream of vital information pouring in from your companion, and the more you play, the more they learn about why and how you play – noting areas you frequently die in, potential locations for items you need, and more. Your Magus can also fall into several different classes that give them different special abilities to assist you – from a Weather Catcher that can spot incoming rain and shield you from it’s damage to another class that specializes in healing you and scanning for the quality of nearby resources.</p>

<p>The blend of endearing human interaction via your Magus and cold, calculated, cool-as-hell mecha combat is the sauce that really brings Synduality Echo of Ada together. So many things have been blended together into this one package, and the fact that it all works so well and creates such an addicting and immersive experience is an absolute treat. When PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds came out, it put a spotlight on the potential of the battle-royale genre and then Fortnite adapted that into a clean, accessible, and addictive alternative. Synduality Echo of Ada is the addictive and accessible extraction shooter that the world has been waiting for.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/09/amplitude-studios-goes-independent-and-splits-off-from-sega/">freshly independent Amplitude Studios</a> has revealed Endless Legend 2, a fantasy 4X sequel that looks to shake things up with shifting seasons and world-changing tidefalls on its ocean planet. The game is coming to PC via Early Access sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Endless Legend 2 will take us to the doomed oceanic planet of Saiadha, its islands battered by shifting seasons, fearsome storms and tidefall. They will transform the world around you, forcing you to adapt your approach to take advantage.</p>
<p>Each race will have a specific philosophy to how they should expand their empire, with heroes used to reveal the story of each faction, while providing the linchpins for your growing relationships with others – whether diplomatic or through conquest. They’ll also be at the forefront as you try to peel back the mysteries of the world, facing ancient perils and uncovering the planet’s deeply hidden secret.</p>
<p>Amplitude Studios regained independence from Sega last year, the publisher selling the studio back to members of its internal team, letting its legacy and franchises –&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless</a> series and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a> – live on.</p>

<p>Another thing that will live on is Amplitude’s form of collaborative development with their community, bringing fans into the process by inviting them to play early versions of their games to gather feedback. If you’re keen to hop in, you can apply to become an Amplitude Insider by <a href="https://ampli.click/insidersprogramsurvey">filling out this survey</a>, with the team aiming to share more details in the coming weeks to those who are selected. This will precede a stint in Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>While the last Endless series game was the tower defence shooter hybrid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/30/endless-dungeon-review/">Endless Dungeon</a>,&nbsp;Amplitude’s last 4X game was Humankind, a fresh take on the historical 4X form. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">our Humankind review</a> we awarded it an&nbsp;impressive 9/10. <em>“Humankind is as deep as you could possibly want from a 4X strategy game, but the constant addition of new things to think about never feels overwhelming because everything’s explained so well, and often with a good bit of humour too. </em><em>It’s an excellent game, and if you’ve never delved into the 4X genre before, this might be your best chance to do so.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most highly-anticipated games of 2025. It’s an open-world RPG with epic proportions, giving players a massive story to explore in one of the most immersive environments ever concocted by a developer. It sounds great at first blush, but is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on PlayStation 5, or are PS players locked out of the experience?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-2-be-on-ps5">Will Kingdom Come 2 Be on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on PS5 </strong>when it goes live worldwide on February 4, 2024.</p>



<p>It’ll also be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S consoles – but it’s <strong>not </strong>being released on Game Pass – yet.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018) was available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, so Warhorse Studios has followed suit in releasing the follow-up title across the same spread. In March 2024, the first game in the series was also released on Nintendo Switch, which was nothing short of an engineering marvel.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-much-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-cost-on-ps5">How much will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Cost on PS5?</h3>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a full-priced, premium release. This expansive game has a gargantuan map (or two) to explore, as well as a story and side content that’ll easily require a 100-hour investment to capture everything. </p>



<p>With that being said, <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will cost $69.99 for the standard edition of the game</strong>. If you want more content, you can buy Kingdom Come 2 on PS5 for $89.99, securing the ‘Gold Edition’.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-be-on-ps-plus">Will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Be on PS Plus?</h3>



<p>It’s impossible to say if Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will surface on PS Plus. The first game had a stint on the subscription service, but that was a few years after it hit the open market. It arrived much earlier on Game Pass, and who’s to say that it won’t happen again with KCD2?</p>



<p>I’d recommend that you don’t wait to see if it’ll appear on PlayStation Plus, as you run the risk of having a marvellous game spoiled by those streaming it and talking about it online. This game has a masterful story that must be experienced first-hand, so it’s worth the initial investment.</p>



<p>If you want more evidence, check out my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/">full preview of KCD2</a>.</p>

            <p>Kumail Nanjiani has reportedly joined the cast for the second season of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>

Amazon has not confirmed Nanjiani's casting, however, <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1882468492303388759">it is said</a> the actor - who previously appeared as Kingo the MCU's Eternals film alongside Angelina Jolie - will play "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel".</p>
<p>Nanjiani looks set to join the likes of Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the series makes its return.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-includes-dlss-4-support-ahead-of-next-weeks-rtx-50-series-arrival.1090797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-adds-dlss-4-support-ahead-of-next-weeks-rtx-50-series-arrival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Well here we are again, with yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch, despite CD Projekt having officially wrapped up development on the game last year. And the headline feature this time around is DLSS 4 support, added in anticipation of Nvidia's upcoming RTX 50 Series of GPUs.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51296/patch-2-21">CD Projekt's update 2.21 patch notes</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 now supports "DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three times per traditionally rendered frame". This, the studio notes, will be enabled alongside the release of the RTX 50 Series next Thursday, 30th January. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, DLSS 4's arrival brings "faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage" that's available for users with either RTX 50 and 40 Series GPUs. Furthermore, players "can now choose between the CNN model or the new Transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA on all GeForce RTX graphics cards today. The new Transformer model enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion."

<p>
There's more going on in today's update than that, however. Version 2.21 also features an extensive range of fixes for Cyberpunk 2077's photo mode, and addresses various issues across the likes of vehicle colour customisation and character creation. Xbox and PlayStation users also get a number of platform-specific fixes, as detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51296/patch-2-21">CD Projekt's patch notes</a>.
</p><p>
Today's release follows December's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">surprise 2.2 update</a>, which introduced the likes of expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - hence the focus on those particular modes in today's patch. CD Projekt's continuing support of Cyberpunk 2077 is perhaps a little surprising given the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended its development</a> last May - although a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Mac version</a> has since been announced for release this year.
</p>
<p>
As previously confirmed, the bulk of CD Projekt is now focused on developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announced back in 2022</a> and finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big Ciri-focused reveal</a> last year.

The company has offered cloud gaming as a beta to a “subset” of subscribers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">since 2023</a>, so this news from Peters indicates that the company is going to continue to invest in it.</p><p>Peters didn’t say exactly when the co-op and party games might be available. But he did say that “we think of this as a successor to family board game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be.”</p><p>Netflix will also continue to focus on “more narrative games based on Netflix IP” — Peters says those games are “consistent fan favorites and we’ve got a lot in the library to work with there.”</p><div><h3>Related</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">The future of Netflix games could look like reality TV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919517/netflix-game-streaming-beta-tvs-us">Netflix tests streaming games to US TVs to take on PlayStation and Xbox</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-never-been-a-better-time-to-watch-macross-plus.1090761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/macross-plus-disney-anime-review-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After decades of legal tussles- that prevented huge swathes of the series from seeing official Western releases <a href="https://gizmodo.com/macross-streaming-disney-plus-robotech-harmony-gold-1851344628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were finally resolved last year</a>, it's now possible to sit down on Disney Plus and watch some <em>Macross</em>. And there's no better place to start than <em>Macross Plus</em>.</p><p><strong>Update 7:45pm:</strong> <em>While I'm in Australia and the series is available on regular Disney Plus here, I've since been told that in the US you need a Hulu subscription to watch it on Disney's service, which sounds unnecessarily complicated to me!</em></p><p>OK that's not <em>quite </em>true. I think to get the absolute MOST out of it you should have seen the original <em>Macross Saga</em> (or at least its Western adaptation as the first season of <em>Robotech</em>, which is on Crunchyroll) first. It's a classic in its own right, and some of <em>Macross Plus</em>--especially its finale--will hit a little harder if you know the series' history.</p><p>But it's not necessary, because <em>Macross Plus</em> also works just fine as a standalone experience. First released in 1995, just over a decade after the original <em>Macross</em> series had wound up, it tells the story of three childhood friends from the colony world of Eden--Isamu, Guld and Myung--who, having travelled the galaxy, are reunited on their home planet as adults, years after a mysterious tragedy tore them apart. Isamu and Guld, both pilots in the military, are now rivals in a government project pitting two experimental transforming fighters against one another, while Myung works as the producer for Sharon Apple, a popstar who also just happens to be an AI construct.</p><p>This isn't a review; you don't need me to tell you this is <em>good</em>, since <em>Macross Plus</em> is comfortably regarded as one of the all-time greats. It's an expertly-told tale of love, friendship and loyalty, the soundtrack is extraordinary and the animation is at times simply breath-taking. Just look at this! This is 1995!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Macross Plus Anime Aesthetic //  Vestron Vulture - Hair on Fire" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkUVkuRFGPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Just LOOK AT ALL THIS</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Macross Plus</em> was a must-watch at the time, and has remained so throughout the decades to pass. I've owned it on VHS, I've owned it on DVD and I've had it on...other formats during the years it was harder to watch. If you've seen it during any point in its existence, that's awesome, because<a href="https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>any </em>time is a good time to watch some classic anime</a>!</p><p>But sitting down with it in 2025 sure was an experience, because for the first time I found the reasons I love it have shifted, and was amazed that an anime that's now 30 years old had so much to say about our own present struggles here on Earth.</p><p>As a teenager watching this in 1995 I would have described this as anime <em>Top Gun</em>. It was a series about two bros, both manly in very different ways--Isamu is Maverick, an uncontrollable hothead, while Guld is Iceman, a cold-blooded pragmatist--duking it out in the skies. It had cool robots! Space combat! Rad music! I couldn't have asked for anything more.</p><p>In 2025 <em>Macross Plus</em> hit me entirely differently, because as an adult living through these times it turns into a series where its most defining trait isn't its combat,<a href="https://www.midrangevancouver.com/posts/2019/5/23/a-generation-later-macross-plus-warnings-about-the-dangers-of-ai-only-seem-more-real" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but its deeply specific series of warnings about the dangers of AI</a>. What's particularly notable about them is that they're not vague, imprecise threats like <em>Terminator</em> or <em>The Matrix</em>, but two laser-focused instances of AI threatening some of our most human pursuits.</p><p><strong>(Spoilers ahead)</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MACROSS PLUS | Trailer | 1994 | マクロスプラス" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/996w-nd8Z_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Macross Plus</em> builds towards, then culminates in, two struggles against the soullessness and inhumanity of AI. Isamu, Guld (even though he's not technically human) and Myung are all striving to be the very best in their fields, but all seemingly come up short when confronted with the touted superiority of AI.</p><p>Once the vocaloid megastar Sharon Apple has an illegal AI chip installed, she severs the connection she once had with Myung--who was secretly providing her voice and emotions--and goes rogue. She has become the perfect pop star, one whose final performance at Macross City is so entrancing that it hypnotises a crowd numbering in the tens of thousands.</p><p>And both Isamu and Guld, who for months have been pushing the limits as test pilots, must now face the government's secret AI fighter the Ghost, a terrifying vehicle unhindered by a human's reaction speeds and physical limitations. When these two men--the two best pilots in the galaxy, piloting the two best fighters in the galaxy--confront Ghost above Macross city during the series' conclusion, it seems they don't stand a chance.</p><p>The message here is clear: despite laws banning the more powerful forms of AI, men in power have found ways to implement it regardless, convinced of its limitless potential in their never-ending quest to seize or maintain power.</p><p>Despite the odds being stacked against them, our heroes prevail. Sharon isn't perfect at all; as an AI she grossly misunderstands what Myung's love for Isamu actually means, which ultimately leads to her demise. And the Ghost fighter fails on multiple fronts; not only was it susceptible to being hacked by Sharon and sent into combat against Isamu and Guld, but it had no answer to Guld's final sacrifice when he flies his YF-21 directly into the AI craft's face.</p><p>Where the AI is painted as seemingly perfect, an evolutionary final step, <em>Macross Plus'</em> human (and Zentraedi) stars are anything but. Isamu is an impulsive, aggressive, misogynistic hothead. Guld is a murderous psychopath who, as we learn at the end of the series, has committed a serious sexual assault. And Myung is--with all acknowledgement of the trauma she has suffered--a complete mess of a person.</p><figure></figure><p>Our heroes are deeply flawed in ways we don't often see from the leads in a series, but that's the point! None of us are perfect, we all make mistakes, and while those can have repercussions big and small, they're what define us. We may be imperfect, but as a result so too is the world we've built around us, and <em>Macross Plus</em>' is as full of subterfuge, corruption, love and hope as our own.</p><p>Injecting AI into that world is as repulsive to many of its inhabitants as it is here. Isamu even says as much earlier on, balking at the idea of listening to a computer sing (remember, Sharon's voice is actually his old friend Myung!), while even the premise of an AI-controlled fighter, in a world where its greatest heroes from the <em>Macross Saga</em> and beyond have been pilots, is an affront not just to the pilots in this series but also us as fans, undermining the very thing that has made <em>Macross </em>so fun over the decades.</p><p>Whether it's the original series or <em>Plus</em> or the seemingly countless contemporary continuations,<a href="https://otakunoculture.com/2021/09/10/on-why-music-matters-in-macross-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Macross </em>is defined by two things: fighters and music</a>. <em>Macross Plus</em> showing us a glimpse of a world where those two things have been handed off to computers is gross, and its story being about humanity's ultimate triumph against AI's horrors is a welcome one 30 years later, exactly when it's needed most.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Four out of five game developers are currently working on a project for the PC, a sizable increase from 66 percent of developers a year ago. That's according to <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Informa's latest State of the Game Industry survey</a>, which partnered with Omdia to ask over 3,000 game industry professionals about their work in advance of March's Game Developers Conference.</p>
<p>The 80 percent of developers working on PC projects in this year's survey is by far the highest mark for any platform dating back to at least 2018, when 60 percent of surveyed developers were working on a PC game. In the years since, the ratio of game developers working on the PC has hovered between 56 and 66 percent before this year's unexpected jump. The number of game developers saying they were <em>interested</em> in the PC as a platform also increased substantially, from 62 percent last year to 74 percent this year.</p>

<p>The PC has long been the most popular platform for developers to work on in the annual State of the Game Industry survey, easily outpacing consoles and mobile platforms that generally see active work from anywhere between 12 to 36 percent of developer respondents, depending on the year. In its report, Informa notes this surge as a "passion for PC development explod[ing]" among developers, and mentions that while "PC has consistently been the platform of choice... this year saw its dominance increase even more."</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of PC gaming among developers is also reflected in the number of individual game releases on Steam, which topped out at a record of 18,974 individual titles for 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. That record number was up over 32 percent from 2023, which was up from just under 16 percent from 2022 (though many Steam games each year were "Limited Games" that failed to meet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile">Valve's minimum engagement metrics</a> for Badges and Trading Cards).</p>

              The number of annual Steam releases also points to increasing interest in the platform.

<h2>The Steam Deck effect?</h2>
<p>While it's hard to pinpoint a single reason for the sudden surge in the popularity of PC game development, Informa speculates that it's "connected to the rising popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck." While Valve has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions">officially acknowledged "multiple millions" in sales for the portable hardware</a>, GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steam-deck-everything-you-were-afraid">estimated</a> that between 3 million and 4 million Steam Deck units had been sold by October 2023, up significantly from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/steam-deck-has-reportedly-sold-over-1-million-units/">reports of 1 million Deck shipments</a> in October 2022.</p>

Yes, Doom has lore, and The Dark Ages seems to be expanding the universe quite a bit. If you're looking to catch up on the full series before The Dark Ages launches in May, you're in luck--not only are the classic games in the series still great to play, you can pick up the full collection of games with the Doom Anthology. This collection includes Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3, Doom 2016, and Doom Eternal Deluxe Edition. You also get a steelbook case and a mini replica of the series' iconic BFG weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">The collection is available on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC, and normally costs $80, but each version is discounted at various retailers.
