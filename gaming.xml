<p>It has been confirmed: Johnny Silverhand and ‚ÄòV‚Äô from Cyberpunk 2077 are heading to Fortnite soon. It seems bizarre that a character who was iconic for rebelling against corporations and consumerism would appear in a game like this, but here we are. It hasn‚Äôt been confirmed when the characters will arrive in Fortnite, but it should be soon.</p>



<p>In a short teaser uploaded on social media, Epic Games revealed the characters ‚Äì the female variant of V, and the standard model of Johnny Silverhand, who Keanu Reeves famously played in the 2020 open-world RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-city-meet-fortnite">Night City, Meet Fortnite</h2>



<p>This will be the second time that Keanu Reeves has appeared in Fortnite. In 2019, the actor was introduced to the Fortnite universe as John Wick, arguably one of his most famous roles to date, beyond playing Neo in The Matrix franchise.</p>



<p>He‚Äôll surface in Fortnite as Johnny Silverhand, one of the most major characters in Cyberpunk 2077 and the catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the game. Also being added is ‚ÄòV‚Äô, the game‚Äôs protagonist. While neither gender is canonical, Epic Games has opted to include the female variant in the upcoming crossover.</p>



<div><article><p><span>We‚Äôre expecting some guests from Night City üåÜ </span></p></article></div>







<p>It‚Äôs not yet confirmed what‚Äôs coming in the bundle, but we‚Äôve seen snippets online showing Cyberpunk 2077‚Äôs ‚ÄòMantis Blade‚Äô weapons as a pickaxe replacement.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hjz19e/cyberpunk_x_fortnite_collab_skins_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a leak on other social media platforms</a>, the character models were reportedly revealed, along with the blades, a back bling, and weapon wraps.</p>

<p>Palworld‚Äôs Feybreak update has arrived with v0.4.11, and it introduces a new weapon called Meowmeow as the first instalment of their Terraria collab. The update also introduces a new island, fresh features, areas, pals, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-meowmeow-is-a-bullet-firing-melee-weapon-nbsp">Palworld‚Äôs Meowmeow is a ‚ÄúBullet Firing Melee Weapon‚Äù&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Through the Feybreak update, players can now try out Meowmeow from Terraria in Palworld. This is a ‚Äúsmall tease of the collab,‚Äù with more to come in 2025. For those wondering, this ‚ÄúBullet Firing Melee Weapon‚Äù is actually a sword that makes cat sounds when you attack. When the player swings the blade, a cat projectile with a rainbow trajectory is thrown at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-feybreak-island-new-mechanics-and-more">Feybreak Island, New Mechanics and More</h2>



<p>The next big part of the Palworld update is the Feybreak Island itself, a land filled with new mysteries, challenges and goals. Additionally, there‚Äôs a new faction that you need to look for on this island, the Feybreak Warriors. These pesky individuals have taken over the island with the power of their missile battery camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The update has also added new mechanics such as Expeditions, Research, Predator Pals, and Bounty NPCs. Players also receive a new raid called Xenolord, where they must defeat a mechanical dragon controlling the Xeno army. There‚Äôs also a Random Pal mode that randomises Pal Spawns. You can filter it by region or keep it entirely random for some chaos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld Feybreak update adds much more content, such as the ability to create new weapons, the addition of new strongholds and stronghold bosses, items, unique skills, player changes, increased cap level, bug fixes, and so on.

<p>That's according to creative director Jonathan Dumont, who told <a href="https://ew.com/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-backstory-fastest-assassin-we-ever-made-exclusive-8762696">Entertainment Weekly</a> that she will have a Naruto run in which she'll "lean forward, arms bent, sprinting at full speed".</p>
<p>"We do have a run on top of buildings that has a little bit of a wink-wink to it," Dumont said.</p>

<p>"Naoe's the fastest Assassin we ever made," he added. "She runs super fast, she has a lot of gadgets to keep her stealth so that she doesn't have to fight often. We wanted to satisfy that for players that come in for that ninja-Assassin game."</p><p>Dumont wouldn't be drawn on further story points, but did say: "She will start a bit of a path of vengeance or fulfilling a promise that she made to her family. As she discovers a world in need, she begins to really value the community values her father taught.</p>
<p>"Can she make a better world? [She realises] they are people who cannot defend themselves, which is tied a little bit more to the models of the [Assassin] Brotherhood.</p>
<p>"[Naoe] was shielded by her father from what's happening in the world, and it comes crashing down," Dumont added. "She is pushed into war. She doesn't know much about her origins. Her father's been training her, but she doesn't know much about her mother, who's been gone. But as a cool proverb from Japan says, 'a frog in a well knows nothing of the sea'.</p>
<p>"She is tossed into the real world, and through that, she will learn that she is not just a shinobi, that there is a little bit of a lineage or at least some mystery about some sort of different type of shinobi. They're Assassins, so she's somewhat linked to that."</p>
<p>It's from her father, Dumont said, that Naoe receives her Hidden Blade.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whilst Naoe is super stealthy and can pull off the signature Leap of Faith if there's a handy pile of shrubbery or hay nearby, co-lead Yakuke can't.</p>
<p>"He doesn't do the Leap of Faith," Dumont said. "He just crashes right into the haystack, and he hurts his butt, too. So, it's pretty funny."</p>
<p>This dual perspective is to ensure fans of both the older and newer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> are satisfied.</p>
<p>"A lot of people like Assassin's at the start with the stealth approach: hiding in the shadows and the crowd. Then we have a little bit more of the action-oriented ones... Odyssey, Origins, and Valhalla," Dumont added. "We try to satisfy both types of players, but also try to not dilute too much of what they like about it."</p>
<p>We also recently learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story and offer a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".</p>
<p>In answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Dumont revealed the game would feature a "canon mode"</a>.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 6 Double XP Coming For The Holiday Period]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-double-xp-week-event/</link>

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a Double XP sweep starting tomorrow, December 24. Although it hasn‚Äôt been announced by Treyarch (or any Activision studio), there‚Äôs a listing for a Double XP event on the Black Ops 6 menu, and it says it‚Äôs starting tomorrow. This will be the latest in a long line of such events that have run since the game dropped in October.</p>



<p>Some could argue that Treyarch has put on <strong>too many </strong>Double XP events, reducing the efficacy of the ‚Äòspecial period‚Äô that allows players to get more out of their grind. Others have argued that the Double XP events are ‚Äòfixed‚Äô and that they don‚Äôt offer the full boost of experience points you‚Äôd expect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-xp-incoming">More XP Incoming</h2>



<p>The next Black Ops 6 Double XP event is set to start tomorrow, December 24. That‚Äôs per a placeholder on the Black Ops 6 menu ‚Äì it‚Äôs yet to be announced by Activision.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has started struggling in recent weeks, ebbing away from the claims that it‚Äôs the ‚Äòbest Call of Duty game in years‚Äô, and that‚Äôs mostly because the title is <strong>plagued </strong>with cheaters. It was admitted by the Call of Duty team that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">they ‚Äòmissed the mark‚Äô</a> with the game‚Äôs anti-cheat mechanic, which means it‚Äôs hard for anyone to have any faith in the product right now.</p>



<p>To that end, some pro players and streamers have started abandoning Black Ops 6 in favour of other games. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/">Nadeshot gave up on streaming</a> Black Ops 6 and relocated to Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>In any case, Black Ops 6 is getting a new Double XP event from tomorrow, December 24. It comes at a time when many new players ‚Äì the age-old ‚ÄòChristmas noobs‚Äô ‚Äì will be joining the ecosystem. However, thanks to SBMM ‚Äì which definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-black-ops-6-have-sbmm-answered/">exists in Black Ops 6</a> ‚Äì you won‚Äôt bump into them unless you‚Äôre pretty awful at the game.</p>

<p>A recent report suggested that Sega, the Japanese gaming giant, could produce a standalone game subscription service based on the extensive library it has built up over the years. This would likely see its games withdrawn from similar subscription schemes live today, capitalising on the growth of the operating model.</p>



<p>The gaming world is no stranger to such service. Today, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Rockstar Games, PlayStation, and Xbox all offer gaming-based subscription programs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undisclosed">Undisclosed</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a>, Sega‚Äôs president, Shuji Utsumi, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre thinking something ‚Äì and discussing something ‚Äì we cannot disclose right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was talking about subscription-based products, and reportedly mentioned that they‚Äôre ‚Äòvery interesting‚Äô and that Sega is ‚Äòevaluating some opportunities‚Äô.</p>



<p>These days, the average gamer is surrounded by subscription-based schemes, and the rise of the live-service game has meant that we‚Äôre all putting money into a pot every few weeks over a long period, rather than paying for something once and then never again.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs one of the most common operating models in the gaming world right now.</p>



<p>Between Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, some 80 million gamers worldwide are subscribed to a service that delivers free games every month and gives them access to repositories filled with games both old and new. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has a service that operates in much the same way, as does Electronic Arts with EA Play.</p>



<p>Sega entering the subscription market might not be the move everyone had on their cards, but why shouldn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs free game and the market is wide open for such schemes right now.</p>



<p>Sega has been running since the 1960s, and in the 1990s, it really dominated the gaming industry. There are <strong>a lot </strong>of classic franchises sitting in that Sega library that would flesh out a subscription service quite nicely.</p>

<p>A reputable movie insider has said that more Indiana Jones games are in development.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs according to DanielRPK, who <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1870926309842473117?t=nxgc-3ez5wVn75-3JoS6Hg&amp;s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>, ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre getting more Indy games.‚Äù</p>



<p>While there isn‚Äôt much to go on at face value, DanielRPK has had a knack for getting some tidbits from movies and games over the years, so his comment should suggest that some projects could have been greenlit behind the scenes.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it‚Äôs only been two weeks since the Indiana Jones and The Great Circle released, so whether or not the game‚Äôs positive reception and/or sales led to more games being approved remains to be seen.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though ‚Äì if the games were approved recently, we‚Äôre likely several years away from seeing another released.</p>



<p>The game description for Indiana Jones and The Great Circle reads, ‚ÄúUncover one of history‚Äôs greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle‚Ñ¢, a first-person, single-player adventure set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark‚Ñ¢ and The Last Crusade‚Ñ¢. Get ready to don your fedora and whip as you step into the shoes of the legendary archaeologist ‚Äî Indiana Jones‚Ñ¢. Embark on an epic globetrotting adventure in a race against enemy forces to uncover the secrets of the mysterious Great Circle.‚Äù</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-significant-improvements-final-fantasy-xvi-xiv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost mode can bring significant improvements in terms of image quality and performance even in games that haven't been patched to take advantage of all the system's features, a new analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In a new video shared over the weekend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at how the current-generation Final Fantasy games run on the mid-generation system released last month. Being the only PS5 Pro Enhanced title, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is clearly the star of the show. In the new Versatility Mode only available on PlayStation 5 Pro, the second entry in the Remake series features improved image clarity and more stable performance over Performance Mode in pretty much every scenario. In combination with a small resolution boost over the base model, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler delivers some impressive results, although with some issues that are unique to the game, such as vegetation issues both at a distance and up close, and common among games using the current iteration of the upscaler, which should become a thing of the past in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">future versions</a>.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting with the other current-generation Final Fantasy games, as none of them have received PlayStation 5 Pro patches. Final Fantasy XVI, for example, shows significant improvements in both display modes. In Graphics mode, for example, Game Boost Mode allows the game to run at a higher internal resolution, which results in clearer and more detailed image. Performance Mode sports a far smaller internal resolution boost but considerably more stable performance with a 24% uplift, which often falls into the system's VRR range. In scenarios where the base model struggles to hit 60 FPS, the PS5 Pro manages to do so consistently. In addition, the game's combination of TSC MAA and FSR 1 leaves much of the image pixel structure intact, resulting in less aliasing on the mid-generation system.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV improvements are more significant on the PlayStation 5 Pro with Game Boost, with an up to 40% performance improvement in 4K mode with dynamic resolution off. On the new system, the game manages to hit 60 FPS consistently, and only the most intense scenarios cause drops. At 1440p resolution, the game also often manages to hit 120 FPS, resulting in great image fluidity. Even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins sports more stable performance on the PlayStation 5 Pro without a dedicated patch, which is a significant improvement for an intense action game like the spin-off developed by Team NINJA.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy on PS5 Pro - Rebirth/14/16/Stranger of Paradise - Every FF Game Tested!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F-0xB-Km_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro offers a variety of new features over the base model, which make it a compelling upgrade for those looking to experience console games at their best despite its high price.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/every-major-fallout-4-faction-ranked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout 4 has some fantastic factions that make up the backbone of the game itself ‚Äì without them, there would essentially be no story for the player to experience. However, there‚Äôs a point of contention within the community as to which Fallout 4 faction is ‚Äòthe best‚Äô. It‚Äôs mostly a subjective debate, but in this list, we‚Äôre seeing every major Fallout 4 faction ranked from worst to best. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ranking-fallout-4-s-factions">Ranking Fallout 4‚Äôs Factions</h2>



<p>Out of all the Fallout 4 factions, we‚Äôve zeroed in on the ‚Äòmain‚Äô groups that contribute the most to the story, so don‚Äôt be disappointed if your all-time favourite fringe faction doesn‚Äôt make the cut. Leave a comment stressing who you think should make the list and we‚Äôll consider adding it!</p>



<p>Here we go ‚Äì every major Fallout 4 faction, ranked <strong>from worst to best</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-railroad-worst">4. The Railroad (Worst)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Railroad might have some admirable goals in mind, but this basement-dwelling, secretive organisation that distrusts the player from the word ‚Äògo‚Äô is typically left standing in the nuclear dust in Fallout 4. They only care about helping synths, and that‚Äôs a huge sticking point for much of the Commonwealth. </p>



<p>There‚Äôs a sweet bonus in the ‚ÄòBallistic Fiber‚Äô mod you can unlock for siding with The Railroad, but it‚Äôs enough to save the faction.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-the-institute">3. The Institute</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Institute ‚Äì arguably the most important Fallout 4 faction because of where it fits into the story, but it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe Boogeyman of the Commonwealth‚Äô for a reason. It terrifies people, and some of the experiments it carries out are nothing short of abhorrent. With that being said, the whole ‚Äòpreservation of science and rebuilding the world‚Äô bit is positive and a huge redeemer for the faction.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs a huge amount of work needed in The Institute‚Äôs PR department, but the upkeep of a hyper-clean, flawless scientific facility some 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse is something that can‚Äôt be discredited.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Honourable Mention: Gunners</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>In Fallout 4, the Gunners are akin to the Raiders, but they‚Äôre more military-based in their appearance and how they operate, and they facilitate the backstory of one of the game‚Äôs best companions, MacCready. They often pair up with the likes of Assaultrons and bring the force of a well-trained unit to any fight.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-brotherhood-of-steel">2. Brotherhood of Steel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Brotherhood of Steel is easily the most recognisable Fallout 4 faction ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably the most iconic faction from the franchise, period. In Fallout 4, the Brotherhood of Steel ‚Äòchapter‚Äô that arrives to shape up Boston is unfortunately quite bigoted and fascist-like in how it goes about its mission, but there‚Äôs something valiant about wanting to rid an entire region of mutated, cannibalistic, and intensely violent creatures, right?</p>



<p>As a special mention, it‚Äôs worth stressing that their arrival in the Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most epic moments in Fallout history.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-honourable-mention-atom-cats"><em>Honourable Mention: Atom Cats</em></h3>



<p><em>No Fallout 4 faction is cooler than the Atom Cats. They‚Äôre a real live bunch, you dig? With their customised suits of power armour and their ‚ÄòGreased Lightning‚Äô vibe, they‚Äôre instantly likeable and probably way more chilled out than they should be, given their surroundings.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-minutemen-best">1. Minutemen (Best)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As we see every major Fallout 4 faction ranked, we can‚Äôt help but list the Minutemen at the top of the pile. This selfless faction exists to unite settlements across the Wasteland, pulling together with community spirit and ensuring that everyone has a voice ‚Äì and a home. There‚Äôs no sinister sub-plot, no underlying regime ‚Äì it‚Äôs just regular folks trying to get by and share what they have with those that need it.</p>



<p>Out of every major Fallout 4 faction, the Minutemen are deserving of the top spot. They might not boast vertibirds or next-generation scientific technology, but they‚Äôre decent people, and they‚Äôre triers, and that‚Äôs all that matters. </p>

<p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield has said that the team tried to pitch Dead Space 4 earlier this year, but the publisher was not interested.</p>



<p>The news came from a live stream by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM&amp;t=5476s&amp;ab_channel=DanAllenGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dan Allen Gaming</a> a few weeks ago, where he sat down with Dead Space creators Glen Schofield, Bret Robbins, and Cristopher Stone.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe tried actually, the three of us, to [pitch] Dead Space 4, said Schofield. ‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre talking this year [that they pitched Dead Space 4]‚Äù, he continued. In response, Allen replied, ‚ÄúAnd what they didn‚Äôt budge?‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúWell, we didn‚Äôt go too deep; they just said we‚Äôre not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and we respected their opinion,‚Äù replied Schofield. He finished on the topic with ‚ÄúWe have some ideas,‚Äù with the trio all saying they would return for a Dead Space 4. </p>



<p>The last game in the Dead Space series to be released was Dead Space 3 in 2013, with the original Dead Space receiving a remake by Motive Studio in 2022. </p>



<p>Since the Dead Space IP stopped with its game in 2023, Schofield released The Callisto Protocol in 2022 with his new studio Striking Distance Studios, which was considered a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series. The game failed to meet Krafton‚Äôs sales expectations of five million units, lowering their expectations to two million.</p>



<p>As for if we‚Äôll ever see another Dead Space, it remains to be seen, but for now, it looks like its creators are all on board with jumping ship to EA if the project gets greenlit.</p>

<p>Just days after the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, Chinese fans have spotted a game called Wukong Sun: Black Legend has popped up, too.</p>
<p>Set to release on Boxing Day, 26th December, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/">2D platformer</a>'s gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/">promotional art</a> and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p>

<p>As Black Myth: Wukong is one of China's most notable video game releases in recent years, many Chinese fans have taken to social media to share their frustration at "malicious developers exploit[ing] the names of well-known games".</p>
<p>"Well-known games have been plagued by imitations for a long time," wrote <a href="https://weibo.com/6004281123/P68YRsu0O?refer_flag=1001030103_">Pear Video</a> (via <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-internet-upset-black-myth-wukong-similarities-nintendo-store-2024-12">BusinessInsider</a>).</p>
<p>"Malicious developers exploit the names of well-known games, reskin various small games, and put them on the shelves of big game stores with similar titles, deceiving uninformed consumers to buy and download."</p>

<p>Here in the UK, a September 2024 release called <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Wukong-s-Child-Monkey-King-Myth-2657748.html">Wukong's Child: Monkey King Myth</a> could similarly be confused with Game Science's game, which released in August.</p>
<p>As yet, neither Nintendo nor Wukong Sun: Black Legend publisher Global Game Studio have commented publicly on the issue.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji recently posted a lengthy statement following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-producer-on-the-game-awards-top-prize-snub-i-came-all-the-way-here-for-nothing">action game's apparent snub for the top prize at this year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
<p>"The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can't figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!" he wrote in a post on Weibo, even though Black Myth: Wukong did come away with the Best Action Game and Players' Voice awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch is now live on PC, addressing some crashing issues and a few other issues.</p>
<p>The 1.1.3 patch, which has been confirmed to be the last patch of the year for the game, is considerably smaller than the previous patch in both size and scope. Weighting around 7.4 GB, the patch focuses on fixing a small selection of issues, introducing a temporary solution to avoid crashes on shader compilation by skipping shaders warm up, as well as addressing a few access violation error crashes, an issue when invert axis options could not be saved after restarting the game and another issue where controls could be lost after shooting, reloading and then examing the artifact.

<p>As mentioned above, the new STALKER 2 patch is much smaller in scope than the previous one, which addressed over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/">1800 issues</a>, improved the A-Life system, and improved optimization, among other things. Performance was also improved on RTX 3000 series cards with AMD frame generation, although the minor improvements show how there's still plenty of work to be done in this regard.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC World by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

Check out the patch notes, below, for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feybreak arrives as developer Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company. After Palworld‚Äôs huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld‚Äôs Pals and Pok√©mon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pok√©mon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld vs. Pok√©mon Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pok√©mon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. However, without explanation, Pocketpair recently tweaked how players summon Pals, with observers speculating the change had to do with the patent infringement lawsuit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn‚Äôt handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld‚Äôs breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that‚Äôs tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5, albeit after a short delay in Japan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on the lawsuit to see who will emerge victorious, if it isn't settled first. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company in court, however, saying: ‚ÄúWe will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Pocketpair has continued to release major updates for Palworld and Feybreak is just the latest example of that.

            <p>
Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s female V are both set to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
The crossover is expected to go live tonight, with the characters and various accessories available to buy in the game's shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games confirmed the crossover and showed off the appearance of the characters within Fortnite yesterday, in a post on social media that teased: "We're expecting some guests from Night City."

<p>
It's perhaps not surprising to see Cyberpunk 2077 turn up in Fortnite - its developer CD Projekt Red has forged close ties with Epic Games through its switch to Unreal Engine for future development (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">first trailer for The Witcher 4</a>, and our first look at The Witcher's world in Unreal, debuted this month at The Game Awards). And the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-4-starts-tomorrow-with-geralt-and-doomslayer">Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri all joined Fortnite previously</a>.
</p><p>
Fun fact: this will be Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite, after his previous addition as John Wick. But he's not the first actor to get into the game twice. Zendaya (in her Spider-Man and Dune guises) and Harrison Ford (as both Han Solo and Indiana Jones) have also previously found their way into Fortnite more than once.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest additions come amidst a typically-busy end of year season for the game. Its Winterfest event is now on offering daily free cosmetic rewards (leading up to a Santa Snoop Dogg skin on Christmas day), heralded by the in-game arrival of Mariah Carey from a giant block of ice. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-and-plungerman-plop-into-fortnite">Skibidi Toilet is now in the game too</a>.

        <p>Key members of original dev team say they were ready and willing to make a sequel.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA reportedly rejected proposals to create a brand new Dead Space game.</p>
<p>Glen Schofield - who directed the original game and went on to co-found both Sledgehammer Games and Callisto Protocol studio, Striking Distance - said that EA shut down a proposal for "Dead Space 4", saying it wasn't "interested right now".</p>
<p>The news follows EA's launch of the critically-acclaimed Dead Space Remake in January 2023, but uncertainty over the franchise's future.</p>

<p>"We tried actually, you know, the three of us. We tried Dead Space 4," Schofield said in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/cU5PrEr1HjM?t=5480">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, alongside his former colleagues, creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. "We're talking this year."</p><p>"We didn't go too deep. They just said, no, we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and you know, we know who to talk to, so we didn't take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so..."</p>
<p>"All three of us sat down and wanted to do it," Stone added. "The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you've got to take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've got some ideas," Schofield teased.</p>
<p>When asked by Allen if they'd really return to the horror series, Stone said: "I'd make a Dead Space 4," and Schofield simply said: "Yes."</p>
<p>When Bret Robbins didn't say anything, Schofield pointed out that Robbins had "a good game going" given he was "having a great time" working with Dan Houser at Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, rumours swirled that despite the Dead Space Remake's critical acclaim, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-series-reportedly-on-ice-following-sequel-remake-rumours">whole series was reportedly "on ice"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Dead Space 4 game is something fans have been yearning for ever since the third mainline installment was released over ten years ago. Of course, the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017 while they were making the Star Wars project codenamed Ragtag threw a big wrench into those plans, but the remake of the first game released by Motive Studios in early 2023 certainly rekindled hopes - at least until the sales, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid critical reception</a>, turned out to be too low, and publisher EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to put the IP back on the shelf.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming</a>, three of the original franchise creators (Bret Robbins, Glen Schofield, and Christopher Stone) revealed that they actually pitched Dead Space 4 to Electronic Arts in 2024. Needless to say, they weren't successful.</p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> We tried, actually, you know, the three of us, for Dead Space 4. I mean, we're talking this year. We didn't go too deep; they just said we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah. We know who to talk to, so we didn't go and take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so yeah.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Christopher Stone:</strong> The industry is in a weird place right now, and people are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you got to, you know, take it with a grain of salt. Who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do Dead Space 4.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> Yeah. We got some ideas.</em></p>
<p>It is likely that they pitched it too soon to Electronic Arts following the unsuccessful release of the remake. The trio tried anyway because they were all free at the time, following their own games that didn't go as well as planned. Bret Robbins was the founder of Ascendant Studios and Game Director on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, which flopped hard, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive layoffs at the studio</a>. Glen Schofield and Christopher Stone were Game Director and Chief Creative Officer at Striking Distance Studios on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Callisto Protocol</a>, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly unsuccessful compared to its budget</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all three have new jobs. This September, Bret Robbins joined Absurd Ventures, the new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> in 2021 by Rockstar's Dan Houser, as Game Director on an unannounced project. Christopher Stone became Studio General Manager of VOID Interactive, the developer behind the tactical FPS game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready or Not</a>, in August. And Schofield? Here's what he said in the video interview:</p>
<p><em>I have been working on a smaller project. We're trying to get funding right now. It's a pretty exciting project. It's smaller, and I'm not directing; I'm going to be executive producing it.&nbsp;When you hear what it's about, if we get the funding, you'll understand. It's something kind of special for me.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like it will be some time before the trio are ready to pitch Dead Space 4 again. Fans might want to prepare for a long wait, but at least they still intend to make it at some point - EA willing, of course.</p>
