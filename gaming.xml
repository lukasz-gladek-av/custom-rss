<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c573620e4dbb2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The weekend has crept up on us once again, so it's time to kick back with a game or two.</p>
<p>Before we get to our plans, however, let's look back on all the Nintendo news that happened this week. Honestly, it was a rather quiet one. Nintendo launched a series of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion Mario shorts</a> and the kid-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app in Japan (which we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">hands-on</a> with), rumours of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">September Nintendo Direct</a> started bubbling away, and The Pokémon Company revealed another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">new Mega Evolution</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also shared our reviews on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's on the cards for this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187146,187176 @ 1756544403 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have never played Kirby and the Forgotten Land before, so I'm putting that right with the catchily-titled Switch 2 version. I've only played through the first world at this point, but what a sweet little 3D platformer! I'm very much excited to get cosy and play some more of it this weekend.</p>
<p>And I'm keeping Kirby as my main focus for this one. I really want to have it polished off before a certain metroidvania comes to gobble up all my time next week...</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I am fully on the Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar train. Choo Choo. I think the game originally came out at a time when I was probably busy doing some boring school-related thing, so I never actually played the original. Also, I guess I always assumed it was a spin-off? Like the Harvest Moon match-3 game, Frantic Farming? I think they came out within a year of each other and I just assumed they were the same kind of thing. Anyway, the remake is pretty great! It's perhaps a little TOO easy — I'm still in spring of year one and I feel like I've made a ton of progress already — but I think they've finally discovered an art style that doesn't look super cheap or derivative! Hooray. I'd still like the character art to look a little less child-like, but we're making progress at least!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a busy one for me. As Alana mentioned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/poll-ahead-of-silksongs-release-are-you-finally-playing-hollow-knight">earlier this week</a>, I've finally started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>! I'm not sure it's going to have the life-changing impact on me that others experienced seven or eight years ago, but I've enjoyed the couple of hours I've played so far and I'm itching to explore more. But! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> launched on Switch this week - I've been anxious to play that since 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is also an utter delight. I completed my first game the other day (well, I got the Gold cart, but there's loads more I could do) - Avianos, the turn-based, dinosaur, castle-conquering one. I've still barely touched the vast majority of the others, but what a treat this thing is. You'll be hearing me wax lyrical come December, guaranteed.</p>
<p>And on the theme of dinosaurs, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a> on sale this week. Following a blisteringly successful viewing of the first film, my kids are obsessed with Jurassic Park and I'm along for the ride, grinning wildly and shedding a tear when they sing along to those John Williams themes and overspending on the 30th anniversary sets Lego released a couple of years ago. You know, for the kids. Compared to the actual Lego, €3.99 for the game is an absolute steal, and it's also the best way to show them the rest of the movies without actually showing them the rest of the movies. Let 'em dream, hmm?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing quite a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment, but the recent reminder that Game Vouchers are on their way out has prompted me to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>. Y'see, I'd like to use the vouchers to get the third and fourth games, but I'd also like to complete the second before I, y'know, start the process. OCD, I guess.</p>
<p>I really want to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> too, and you better believe I'll be sinking a few more hours into the new <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> demo on PS5 before it disappears!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> last weekend, I’ll finally be wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>, which has gone completely under the radar but is one of the best games I’ve played this year. Creative movement, challenging puzzles, all wrapped up in a Zelda-style overworld with a Metroidvania-esque structure? It’s excellent; do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no new games for me this week (you know why), but I will be downloading that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> demo. I’m glad people who’ve never played the series before are checking this one out, and I’m eager to see what the fuss is about with this remake. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next season of <em>Kill Team</em> launches with a brand new box, featuring a new setting, new kill teams, and new missions.&nbsp;In this article, we'll take a look at the new kill teams and what else <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>The Awoken And The Purgers</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World, although a huge box, is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>, and while it contains a lot of content, it requires a copy of the Kill Team core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. As with previous expansions, it&nbsp;adds 2 brand new kill teams, a new set of non-player operative miniatures and missions, and because it's the start of the new season, it includes the core terrain for this season's kill zone.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World Dossier</li>
	<li>10x Adeptus Astartes Deathwatch Miniatures</li>
	<li>8x Necron Canoptek Circle miniatures</li>
	<li>13x Necron Warriors and Canoptek Scarab Swarm&nbsp;NPO miniatures</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tomb World game board, scenery pieces, and event cards</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-2.jpg?itok=oSBYL17U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-2.jpg?itok=9EJRglJP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> heads back indoors in the close-confines of <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World.</figcaption></figure><p>The included non-player operatives (NPOs) and event cards are for use in the Joint Ops: Tomb World mission pack for cooperative or solo play. This pack has players battling&nbsp;AI-controlled Necrons. The mission pack has 6 missions and 3 maps for joint ops, and the rules and 3 maps for player vs player games, with the added complication of AI-controlled Necrons.</p>

<p>With the returning Gallowdark-style corridors of kill zone Tomb World, the rules for close quarters fighting are included, along with rules for the unique scenery pieces the box contains, like the teleporter, hatchways, and breachable walls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-5.jpg?itok=hySz3deQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-5.jpg?itok=_3G8OaZ1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World scenery offers a thematically claustrophic experieince.</figcaption></figure><h2>Seasonal Changes</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World is the start of the next season of <em>Kill Team</em>, which means that the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/oEk5abZ8/kill-team-managing-the-range-of-kill-teams-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">kill team rotation</a> previously detailed by Games Workshop will come into effect. We should expect a full updated article on which kill teams are legal for tournament play, but all kill teams with existing rules in this edition will still be balance updated and can be used for any games outside of tournaments.</p>

<p>With the new season, we also expect the <em>Kill Team</em> <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/mhstieyb/kill-team-approved-ops-2025-snatch-the-initiative-and-secure-new-objectives/" rel="nofollow">Approved Ops 2025 card pack</a> to release alongside Tomb World. This card pack updates the Tac Ops for the 4&nbsp;archetypes, along with new and returning Crit Ops and the standard Kill Op. It also includes new map layouts for&nbsp;Killzones Volkus, Bheta-decima, Gallowdark, and the new Tomb World.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-3.jpg?itok=B3WdBSHO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-3.jpg?itok=5lfHwset 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Deathwatch kill team gives you increbile variety when chosing your 5-man kill team.</figcaption></figure><h2>Suffer Not the Xenos To Live</h2>

<p>Before <em>Kill Team</em> existed as a game, the Deathwatch used the name to describe the temporary groups of Space Marines pulled from every chapter to serve in the Deathwatch's core function of eliminating the Xenos threat. These Space Marines don black armor during their service, leaving only one shoulder pauldron painted in the colors of their original chapter. They then get access to the intelligence and specialised wargear that allows the Deathwatch to serve their purpose.</p>

<p>The Deathwatch kill team has access to 11 operatives, but fields 5 in a kill team. This gives you a huge amount of flexibility going into battle, allowing you to tailor your forces to respond to your opponent. The Tomb World set includes enough sprues to let you build 10 Deathwatch marines, allowing you to build nearly one of each type (having to make a choice between 2 of the 3 Gravis armored marines). This means you can build 2 entire Deathwatch kill teams for games of Joint Ops using the Tomb World or other joint ops rules.</p>

<p>The standout Deathwatch marines for us, and our first Deathwatch kill team loadout, are the Watch Sergeant, who can use a strategy and firefight ploy once per battle for free. The Blademaster Veteran, who wields a Xenophase blade and can fight against every enemy in its control range. The frag cannon-wielding Bombard Veteran who has 2 fire options, the very high damage shell or the torrent ruled shrapnel. The Gunner Veteran, armed with a heavy plasma incinerator, and the Marksman Veteran, who can go on guard to punish any enemies moving into their view, and when using the close quarters rules, immediately go back on guard after performing a shoot action.</p>

<p>All the Deathwatch Marines can perform 2 shoot or fight actions each turn, and can also perform an additional (but different) single point action when they counteract. The Deathwatch also have access to special ammunition, which can be used once per turning point to add 1 of 7 special rules to a shooting attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-4.jpg?itok=OqIyiHfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-4.jpg?itok=zkc-1oE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While the Canoptek Circle kill team roster is fixed, you get a never ending supply of warriors to throw at your opponent.</figcaption></figure><h2>Dreams Of A Dynasty</h2>

<p>The Necrons are the robotic undead of a long-forgotten empire, sleeping in tombs and awakening when disturbed. Serving the forgotten masters of this sleeping empire are Crypteks, engineers who seek to further their own agendas, whilst serving their masters. The Canoptek Circle kill team are led by a Geomancer Cryptek who can change the form of matter to move through physical barriers, or aggressively to utterly destroy their targets. Supporting the Geomancer are Canoptek constructs, mindless thrawls acting out their will.</p>

<p>The Canoptek Circle has a fixed kill team roster, led by the powerful Geomancer who can use their abilities to damage all operatives near a scenery piece, and move them, or any other friendly operative through walls. The Canoptek Circle deploys 3 obelisk node tokens at the start of the game. These tokens can be used to control uncontest objectives and also create a node matrix if they are within 6 inches of another node, boosting the kill team's abilities if friendly operatives are within the node matrix.</p>

<p>Backing up the Geomancer are 2 Tomb Crawlers, which are large mobile weapons platforms, 1 Accelerator, who can boost other Canoptek operatives' action points by 1, 1 Macroctye Reanimator, who can heal and resurrect other operatives, and 3 Warriors, who aren't very durable, but can damage nearby enemies when killed, and respawn at the start of your turn in your dropzone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-6.jpg?itok=WdZ0VKtI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-tomb-world-6.jpg?itok=mVct7XBJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Deathwatch do not suffer the alien to live in <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World.</figcaption></figure><h2>Kill Team Tomb World Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World is a fantastic start to the new season. The box contains enough miniatures for 3 kill teams (2x 5-man Deathwatch and 1 Canoptek Circle kill team), plus 13 extra NPO miniatures for solo and cooperative play, along with enough scenery to fill a game board with walls to capture the claustrophobic feel of a Necron Tomb.</p>

<p>As a Space Marine player myself, it's great to see the original kill team finally represented, and the fact that you get enough miniatures to build 2 whole Deathwatch kill teams out of the box gives you an insane amount of variety when putting your roster together, or play joint ops straight out of the box. The Canoptek Circle kill team are also very interesting, with a powerful leader and 2 strong weapons platforms, with the respawning warriors that your opponent will never fully get rid of. They offer a thematic Necron experience, as you can throw warriors at your opponent without a care.</p>

                <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> would release on September 4 was such a surprise that even the most tuned-in Hollow Knight fans were in shock at the news. And now, just days before Silksong releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is seeing a renaissance with gamers, passing its Steam concurrents records over and over again, hitting a new peak of 56,192 players on August 29, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>For years, Hollow Knight's biggest day was in May of 2022 when the game had over 20,000 concurrent players. Since the announcement of Silksong's impending release date, though, each consecutive day has seen that concurrent peak rising, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">hit 21,000 on August 22</a>, just a day after the announcement, and hit 56,192 today. For a seven-year-old indie game, this is pretty big.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that SteamDB is not the be-all-end-all of game stats. Steam is a dominant platform for sure, but Hollow Knight is available on all last and current-generation consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch being a particularly popular platform for the game. Even so, it's indicative that the legend of Hollow Knight continues to grow.</p><p>We got a sneak peek last week, and signs are looking good. "Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Hw3clSJDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox Main Theatre Show</a> at PAX West, the Texas-based game developer unveiled the endgame and post-launch roadmap for Borderlands 4, which is due to launch in less than two weeks. In the upcoming game, players will continue to progress their characters through weekly challenge missions and unlockable specializations to further customize their loadout.</p>



<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is returning, albeit reimagined from previous iterations. This post-game difficulty option challenges players with five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, based on lessons learned from previous games in the franchise, players no longer need to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will advance through curated mission challenges that test their chosen build. These challenges grow more difficult as players progress, eliminating the need to re-farm the same gear.</p>



<p>Each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode rank includes exclusive Firmware set bonuses for gear that players will first find while playing the campaign. The first loot drops with Firmware should start appearing around level 25. The more Firmware a player acquires, the higher their stat bonus will be. These powerful bonuses can be transferred to another item once, after which the original item is destroyed, and the firmware bonus cannot be transferred again.</p>



<p>Multiple incentives will be provided to encourage Borderlands 4 players to continue searching for the best loot. Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates.</p>



<p>The Maurice's Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, offering varied loot for every player. These activities are all available for online matchmaking, as you'd expect in this type of game.</p>

<p>Gearbox Software then switched to discuss the game's post-launch roadmap, starting with the free updates. Seasonal Mini-Events will kick off in October with Horrors of Kairos offering new Legendary Weapons, Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Invincible Bosses are also returning to test players’ skill and build inside high-level new boss arenas that integrate the new traversal mechanics introduced with Borderlands 4. Powerful new Legendaries are the juicy rewards for players strong enough to defeat Invincible Bosses. Additionally, a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level will release alongside each Invincible Boss.</p>



<p>As for the paid DLCs, there will be two types: Story Pack and Bounty Pack. The first of two announced story packs, scheduled for Q1 2026, features the return of fan-favorite Ellie in "Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned." With a cosmic horror theme and a bloodier, darker tone than the main campaign, this Story Pack includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, and all-new legendary gear. It also introduces the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. Additionally, this pack includes four new Vault Hunter skins, two new vehicle skins, three ECHO-4 drone skins, and one ECHO-4 frame, as well as attachments.</p>



<p>The first Bounty Pack will arrive earlier than that, in Q4 2025. In Bounty Packs, Borderlands 4 players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the universe. These missions reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, beginning with Rush, the gregarious leader of the Outbounders. Each Bounty Pack includes new main missions, a new boss, new legendary gear, one player skin, one ECHO-4 drone skin, one new vehicle, and a Vault card. This allows players to unlock 24 cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable gear.</p>



<p>The second Bounty Pack will land in Q1 2026 alongside the Pearlescent items (which will be free). Pearlescent gear drops will be challenging to find, but their power level matches their coveted rarity. Borderlands 4 is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on September 12</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must wait until October 3</a> to play it. </p>

                <p>In celebrating the legacy of Battlefield, EA recently released a new battle pass for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. Called “Road to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>”, it features unlockable skins and cosmetic items that represent different games in the series. What’s most notable about the pass--beyond the fact that’s completely free--is that it also includes 20 item unlocks for the upcoming Battlefield 6.</p><p>Like most battle passes, the unlockable items are grouped into levels or tiers. In Tier 8, for instance, players will be able to unlock a Battlefield 1 era player card background, card icon, weapon package and more. There are even a few vehicle and soldier skins up for grabs at the later levels; fans looking to unlock the Aurora Vehicle Skin from Battlefield Bad Company 2, for instance, can do so after hitting Tier 30.</p>

<p>"Just two months to go"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix locked in an October release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> earlier this year, and if you've been wanting an update about how it's progressing, it's now gone gold!</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest">Dragon Quest</a> social media account <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1961625174115295508">shared a photo</a> of remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka alongside industry legend and "father of Dragon Quest", Yuji Horii. The team has also taken the time to remind everyone how there's now "just two months to go" until this anticipated release arrives.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1837c7d8e94e/dragon-quest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pair actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-officially-gone-gold-out-this-november">took a similar snap</a> when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> went gold on Switch and other platforms in September 2024.</p>
<p>While this might not seem like much to be excited about, for the developers behind upcoming releases, going gold means main development is complete and ready for the production phase. Of course, teams can still make smaller improvements before launch, and then there's post-launch support <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">in the form of updates</a> and DLC. This kind of news can also be another reassuring sign that everything is still on track.</p>
<p>When Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake does launch for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, fans will need to buy the game on the Nintendo platform of their choice, as Square Enix has already confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there's no upgrade path currently planned</a>. Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes can only be used with this particular version of the game (the same applies to the Switch release).</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game.1284621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the world of Kaiju No. 8, titanic, otherworldly beasts are a constant threat in Japan: to the extent that not only is there a military organisation – the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force (JAKDF) – set up to deal with them, but there are also regimented clean-up crews whose jobs are to come in and cut up then cart away the often skyscraper-sized foes once they’ve been felled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lead character Kafka Hibino dreams of being a JAKDF officer, but at the start of the series is working in clean-up, and hoping that when there’s work to be done he doesn’t get assigned the intestines… for obvious reasons. It’s not long, however, before he’s – <em>season one spoiler alert here</em> – both a member of the JAKDF and dealing with the fact that he’s somehow been gifted/cursed with the powers of a kaiju himself, designated by the powers that be as Kaiju No. 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stylish action, goofy humour and bad-ass characters all come together to make what follows a whole heap of fun, and frankly, excellent fodder for a video game. Why so? Well, in terms of action, the series focuses around squad-based combat against bizarre and menacing enemies both large and small, with battles decided by exposing each creature’s core (i.e. weak point) and finishing it off. Pair that with highly individual characters, who have a range of expertise in different weapons and fighting styles, and you’ve got a video game waiting to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Akatsuki Games, and Kaiju No. 8 The Game. This free-to-play turn-based RPG on mobile (with PC to follow) very much fits the mold for modern Japanese live service mobile games, with gacha rolls for characters and weapons, and numerous different currencies and crafting materials that allow you to level up characters, moves, weapons and more. This is a game with daily check in rewards, time-limited events and grinding for materials so you can enhance your characters and take on the next challenge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that’s your kind of thing is up to you, but there’s no doubt that the team has put a lot of effort into this title. Akatsuki Games has been working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game for more than two years – since well before the anime started airing – with a team size of around 200 people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a game with excellent presentation, thanks to well-realised 3D character models, a good sense of scale, and super slick combat animations. The core gameplay loop is compelling too, putting you in control of a four person squad in turn-based battles that move quickly and have plenty of room for strategic depth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kaiju No. 8 The Game also has an impressive amount of content out of the gate. Not only does it have an original story to play through (set during the second season of the anime, which is airing now), complete with an impressive amount of voice acting (in Japanese), but it has other modes that highlight iconic moments from the manga/anime’s story, tell side stories for the main characters, and so on. It even has a side-scrolling combat mini-game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/side-scrolling-mini-game-1756461272866.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8's side-scrolling combat mini-game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dig into some of the specifics.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What’s the Story?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Kaiju No. 8 The Game, Dimensional Gates are opening up in the sky and a stream of kaiju threats are swarming out. Is this a job for the JAKDF? Yes, but with a little help from CLOZER (that’s the rather awkward “Closing Order With Zero Restrictions”, in case you’re curious), a special organisation tasked with sealing said gates. The plot twist, however, is that the captain of CLOZER is Sagan Shinomiya – one of a handful of brand new characters – and fan fave Kikoru Shinomiya’s sister.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set-up allows for a never-ending stream of gameplay as you fight through the kaiju from a particular gate, culminating in a boss battle and closing the gate, then moving on to another. It’s a fun premise, however, as the gates themselves connect to a different dimension, meaning that iconic kaiju that have already been neutralised in Kaiju No. 8’s world can still appear, allowing the game to dive into battles only referenced in the manga/anime. My hands-on, for instance, culminated in a fight with an alternate version of the legendary Kaiju No. 2. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/kaiju-no-2-1756461366397.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important point is that while the manga/anime is set entirely in Japan, these gates are opening up globally, so the game can roam all over the place. You can imagine how a live service title might take advantage of travelling to different parts of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Sagan, and a couple of other entirely new characters, Kaiju No. 8 The Game is packing all the series mainstays you’d expect, from the captain of the Third Division Mina Ashiro (and her tiger Bakko) and her vice captain Soshiro Hoshina, through to the captain of the First Division (and otaku slacker) Gen Narumi and Kafka’s partner Reno Ichikawa. Each, as you would expect, has a signature weapon and fighting style, from Hoshina’s twin swords through to Sagan’s shield, which she uses like a blunt weapon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8… giving him a completely different set of moves.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kafka is perhaps the most interesting, as he is essentially two characters in one. All the other fighters unleash a flashy attack when their Ultimate is triggered in battle, but Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8 for the rest of the encounter, giving him a completely different set of moves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Squad Up!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle system lets you choose a squad of four before each mission, and the order in which you place them creates two pairs of “battle buddies”, dictating who executes follow-up attacks when you expose a kaiju’s core. (More on that in a sec.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is turn-based, with the upcoming move order shown at the bottom of the screen. As you’d expect, characters have a wide array of options from single and multi-target strikes through to buffs and debuffs, but there are a couple of key systems that open up strategy. The first is that your party has a shared SP pool (mana, essentially). A normal attack restores a pip, while using a combat skill depletes one. This approach means you need to be tactical in how you manage your resources in order to use your characters’ most powerful techniques.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this is the system for exposing an enemy’s core – a pivotal part of combat in the manga/anime that’s been brought across to the game. Enemies have discreet shields (called plates) that reduce the amount of damage they’ll take, so the main priority in any combat encounter is working out the most efficient way to break them. Some plates can be broken with any attack, others require specific types of attacks. You might need to use an elemental attack, or even more specifically, an attack utilising one of the five elements in the game (fire, ice, wind, lightning and water). Obviously different characters have different types of attacks, so ensuring your squad has the affinities necessary for the combat encounter you’re going into is key.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breaking enemy plates is vital because once you destroy them all, the kaiju in question’s core is exposed, triggering an automatic follow-up attack from the attacking character’s partner and forcing the foe to skip a turn, bumping it back down the turn order sequence at the bottom of screen. It’s pretty satisfying knocking a kaiju back just as it’s about to attack, or better yet, preventing it from unleashing its Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Ultimates, each character has a gauge that fills as they fight (with follow-up attacks boosting it significantly), and these are – as you’d expect – some of the flashiest and strongest attacks in the game. Ultimates are great for finishing off kaiju with their core exposed, and can be triggered at any time, overriding the upcoming attack order. One thing to bear in mind is that missions are made up of several combat encounters, one after the other (with fast-paced ninja running in between, as the squad sprint to the next battle), and your SP pool and Ultimate charges carry over from battle to battle so, if the final encounter is significantly harder, you can prep for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/ultimate-cut-scene-kaiju-no-8-1756461500781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Missions are made up of several combat encounters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat overall is fast and slick, letting each character show off their individual styles while also working as a team. You’re generally fighting smaller kaiju that attack in groups, but the game does also pit you against the kinds of towering monsters the manga/anime is known for, with the camera set low to really help sell the scale of the encounters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Enhancing and Ascending</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a good strategic foundation to Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s combat, but as with most RPGs, your characters need to be constantly leveling to keep up with the opposition you’ll face next. There are a somewhat overwhelming number of systems in place to allow your characters to grow more powerful, and they’re pretty much all centered around material drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to quickly give you an idea, you use Defense Force Manuals (of which there are several rarities), along with credits, to “enhance” (i.e. level up) your characters. These all drop from playing the game and are essentially spendable XP. Initially your characters max out at level 20, but the level caps can be expanded, boosting the character in question and also increasing the challenge level of story missions and opening up higher difficulty training options. (Training, incidentally, is how you get the materials to enhance individual skills, but is subject to a stamina system.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters can also “Ascend”. This requires you to have a double of the character and other resources, and gives you a bonus perk. On top of all this you can enhance your characters’ weapons and individual skills. There’s a lot to keep track of, and it feels like you’ll need to have a decent pool of competitive characters in order to swap your squad around if you need specific plate-breaking abilities, which means engaging with a tonne of different collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New weapons and characters are acquired through the game’s gacha rolls, and utilise a star system for rarity. For the most part you’ll be getting three star weapons, and it remains to be seen how many rolls free-to-play players will be able to generate, as well as how fairly priced the gacha system will be for paying players. One thing is certain, though – the pool of characters and weapons is pretty large, and the rarest drops infrequent, so if you’re hunting for something specific, it may be a long process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the many trappings of free-to-play mobile game design, Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s moment to moment gameplay has a lot going for it, with clever core battle mechanics, slick animations and impressive visuals. And with its strong emphasis on story, and clear reverence for the source material, this adaptation will definitely be worth a look for fans of the series. Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out on August 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

<p>Keep on rollin'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last February, you might recall how our retro-focused sibling site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3d-platformer-rollin-rascal-is-a-colourful-love-letter-to-sonic?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlighted a new high-speed game called <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rollin_rascal">Rollin' Rascal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiomatic/rollin-rascal">this Kickstarter project</a> (drawing inspiration from 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic</a> platformers and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a>) had just reached its Nintendo Switch goal, and now, well over a year later, the development team Curiomatic has revealed the title will be coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This information was shared during the developer's recent Direct-style video presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal will be released on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Rollin' Rascal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74da66cc2559/rollin-rascal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Curiomatic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the original Switch version was a stretch goal, the developer further notes how the console ports (in general) will begin production once the full game is complete.</p>
<p>There's no set release date for this title just yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2740750/Rollin_Rascal/">a demo is currently available on Steam</a>, and the team plans to roll out the game's story mode in chapters, starting with the first chapter "early next year". As for the full launch, according to the Kickstarter page, it's estimated to be delivered at some point in June 2026.</p>
<p>Here's a description detailing what exactly you can expect, and the rundown video above goes into the latest development updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal is a love letter to high-speed 3D platformers like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> with the dynamic interactivity of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Strap in for a thrilling ride filled with speed, excitement, and a cast of endearing characters—an experience that’ll delight classic speedster fans, while also introducing newcomers to the genre!"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man was shown off at PAX West, and we had the chance to attend a press briefing to learn more about the upcoming set launching next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before we get to the cards, there is a new official draft called Pick-Two Draft. Instead of the normal eight players, you'll only need four. And instead of picking one card, you'll pick two. This makes the matches quicker, and you can play it officially at your local game store after Spider-Man's launch.</p>



<p>So far, most of the revealed cards for the Spider-Man set have been focused on the good guys, and now we’re getting an opportunity to check out a lot of the iconic Spider-Man villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This particular iteration of The Sinister Six on Beyond the Sinister Six! shown below&nbsp;features the original cast of villains when the group first formed in the comics. There's plenty of venom shenanigans and more too.</p>

<h2>Spider-Man Bonus Sheet Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We also had a chance to see what the bonus sheet cards will be for the set. They feature some iconic comic moments from all over Spider-Man's history, often with art from artists who actually worked on the Spider-Man comics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with some new art from some Marvel artists, there will be plenty of iconic images from comic panels and covers throughout the set. Expect to see plenty of Jack Kirby, Todd McFarlanae, John Romita Sr., and a whole lot more. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>See Some Iconic Spidey Suits&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Spectacular Spider-Man is one of the central cards in the set and the Magic team has taken the opportunity to show off some iconic and maybe some more obscure spidey suits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of them are the same card mechanically, but feature different art with new suits. The backgrounds are even in the same location, but the time of day or season may be different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Some More Spider-Man Showcase Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>With Spider-Man, the Magic team has used the showcase cards to show not only just iconic moments in Spider-Man history but storylines as well. Sagas try to tell the arc of a story over the course of the card and will have comic panels to convey the mechnanics and story moving along.</p>

<h2>The Infinity Stones Enter Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Well, Marvel is really getting into Magic: The Gathering now as our first Infinity Stone enters the universe: The Soul Stone. This will be the chase card of the set and will come in three different versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does that signal there will be more to come? They’re not saying but I think it’s a safe bet we’ll see more of the stones in future sets and some insane Infinity Gauntlet card at some point too. It’s a huge universe, and this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-most-advanced-robovac-with-a-mechanical-arm-is-1000-off-roborock-selling-off-all-inventory-2000621455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-most-advanced-robovac-with-a-mechanical-arm-is-1-000-off-roborock-selling-off-all-inventory.1284528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock is turning 11, and to celebrate the occasion, they’ve done the impossible: offering a massive price cut on their most powerful and advanced robot vacuum ever. The iconic <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/">Saros Z70 vacuum normally costs a whopping $2,599 but is now available just for $1,599</a> on Roborock’s website during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3809/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<p>If you’re a <strong>tech hobbyist</strong> who’s been dreaming of owning a unique robot vacuum, it’s your time. Not only is this a massive $1,000 off, but it’s also a rare opportunity to purchase it since the device was recently released a few months ago and g<strong>enerated a huge buzz at CES this year</strong>. Getting your hands on this vacuum for that kind of money is a major win.</p>
<h2>Best Robot Vacuum?</h2>
<p>The most unique aspects of the Roborock Saros Z70 is its <strong>OmniGrip mechanical arm</strong>: It’s no standard cleaning arm, and Roborock designed it to perform on different types of floors and move into those tricky corners and edges where dust settles. It cleans with precision and leaves no spot behind. Coupled with its very thin profile—less than 8 centimeters thick—the vacuum smoothly moves under sofas, beds, and other low-clearance furniture. That low profile also means you won’t need to move heavy furniture just to clean your space, which is a huge plus for anyone who hates extra work.</p>
<p>The <strong>StarSight Autonomous System</strong> navigation system on the vacuum works with a combination of cameras and sensors to map your space with great accuracy. This tells the Saros Z70 exactly where it’s already been and where it still needs to vacuum, and avoids obstacles like furniture legs and walls. It even has a double anti-tangle system that keeps it from getting caught on cables or rugs, something far too common in other robot vacuums.</p>



<p>Perhaps the strongest spec is the suction power: At <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce</strong>, the vacuum draws in dirt, dust, and debris with virtually unbeatable power. Most vacs for consumers, for instance, hover between 5,000 to 12,000 Pa, so this is a whole different story. It performs beautifully on carpets and picks up pet hair and crumbs, and it’s gentle enough not to damage wooden or tile floors. The Saros Z70 further features the <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis complemented by FlexiArm riser technology: These enable it to adjust its height and grip to offer a clean one even on an uneven surface without hurting sensitive flooring.</p>
<p>Roborock also packed in the <strong>Multi-functional Dock 4.0</strong> to ensure that maintenance is easy: The smart dock charges the device not just that, but also vacuums the dustbin and refills the water tank for mopping, and removes from you the time consumed by maintenance. It’s the optimal combination of convenience and efficiency that has your vacuum at your command whenever you are ready to get to work. It means roughly seven weeks of handsfree cleaning.</p>
<p>The Roborock Saros Z70 is a real game-changer for home cleaning, and with the price cut (from $2,599 to $1,599), it’s a deal that’s tough to beat.</p>

Players will experience progression through weekly challenge missions, unlockable Specializations to further customize their loadout, and the return of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li><li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li><li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li></ul><p><strong>Post-Launch Roadmap</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li><li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-price-revealed-shockingly-low/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-price-possibly-revealed-by-gamestop-and-it%E2%80%99s-shockingly-low.1284513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered by eagle-eyed Hollow Knight fans that Silksong has been listed on GameStop on Nintendo Switch for just $19.99.  This price has prompted many to believe it’s a ‘simply a placeholder’ because they can’t understand why Team Cherry isn’t charging more for one of the most anticipated games of 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that users have reportedly tried to check out with Hollow Knight: Silksong in their basket at that price, but it ‘does not go through.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-just-19-99">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Just $19.99?</h2>



<p>In a post that surfaced on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight subreddit</a>, it was revealed that GameStop has priced the upcoming title at just $19.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Hollow Knight was released way back in 2017, it came with a price tag of just $14.99, but it was a brand-new title from a remarkably small team. It was said that Team Cherry wanted to make the game accessible to more players, which is still a theme prevalent among some small studios today.</p>



<p>The lowest price Hollow Knight dropped to is around $5.99.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users started debating the price, with some being bewildered that Team Cherry isn’t pushing the popularity of the game to charge more. One user wrote, ‘I was ready to pay 40 bucks. Am I crazy? I’m not even as big a fan as you guys, but it’s been the going rate for quality games, especially if they’re a sequel to a well-loved one.’</p>



<p>Many stressed that Team Cherry doesn’t <strong>need </strong>to charge more because ‘they are really rich because of Hollow Knight.’</p>



<p>Another user pointed out how the price is potentially harmful to subscription services:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Wild if true.</p>



<p>At that price there’s basically zero reason to play it on Game Pass unless you already have it. PC Game Pass is $12 a month, Xbox is $15. A few more $ to keep the game for life is a no brainer honestly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be released on September 4 after years of painstaking waiting. Are you going to pick it up, whatever the price is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Players play the role of Mai, a 15 year old Thai girl who feels lost and overcome with guilt because of the death of her parents. Mai meets an 11 year old ghost, who has lost her memory and who is trapped in this world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Mai is the only one who can see the ghost, and there is a reason why their fates are tied together. Mai decides to help the ghost remember who she was and fulfill her dream so she can move on. Ironically, Mai, the living girl, struggles to enjoy life, while the ghost girl is full of vibrancy and life. Mai sets out to help the ghost, but it is really the ghost that teaches Mai how to be fully alive.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_989317"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Dancing with Ghosts</em> is at the heart of the story and at the heart of the gameplay.

It explores themes of self-forgiveness, acceptance, empathy for the struggles of others, and even romance… well, in a very innocent and sweet way.</p><p>Players get to play both as Mai and as the ghost. As Mai you help others in the village and earn good Karma to help Pim on her way. You play cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story.</p><p>Players also play as the ghost, entering the minds of everyone in the village and hearing their thoughts.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-crucial-or-wd-this-samsung-990-evo-plus-2tb-ssd-costs-peanuts-on-amazon-2000621435</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-crucial-or-wd-this-samsung-990-evo-plus-2tb-ssd-costs-peanuts-on-amazon.1284495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The internal SSD market doesn’t have a ton of options if you want a powerful drive, but Samsung is definitely leading the race right now. If you’re looking for a 2TB SSD that offers serious speed at a reasonable price point, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung’s 990 EVO Plus just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon at only $119, down from $176</a>. That’s a crazy good deal compared to similar drives from Crucial or WD_Black that go for $129 to $189 right now. Plus, it’s getting <strong>rave reviews with a solid 4.8 out of 5 stars</strong>, so it’s definitely worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Speed</h2>
<p>This Samsung 990 EVO Plus has a <strong>PCIe Gen 4×4 interface</strong> and features <strong>read speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s</strong>. What does that do for you? Quick game loading, quick file transfer, and apps in a flash, cutting down on waiting time big time. It’s an M.2 2280 size, basically saying it will be compatible with nearly any new laptop or desktop available. Samsung also uses something called HMB Technology which allows the drive to manage its memory smoothly.</p>
<p>The drive also has Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 which boosts write speeds when you most need them. That’s a nice little kick when you’re copying data or moving files around, so the whole system feels nippier as time goes on while the drive smartly learns about how you use it. This’s not necessarily about raw speed: it’s about keeping your system responsive and efficient. And let’s be honest, Samsung’s all about quality, so this SSD is well-ventilated and won’t drain your battery even if you’re using it hard.</p>



<p>Worried about how long it will last? This SSD is built to endure. It includes a high Total Bytes Written (TBW) rating, which is just geek speak for “it can write a whole lot of data throughout its lifetime,” so you can game, work or store a gazillion files without fear. Samsung also offers great software utilities that let you keep tabs on your drive’s health and optimize its performance easily.</p>
<p>At this cost and with Samsung’s impeccable track record, the 990 EVO Plus 2TB SSD is a deal that won’t leave you disappointed.</p>

			<p>Playtonic's enhanced version of Yooka-Laylee, the aptly named <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2025-make-the-jump/">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2, this coming October 9, 2025.</p>



<p>If you already own Yooka-Laylee, then you'll be able to upgrade to this new enhanced version at a 30% discount of its $29.99/£24.99/28,99€ launch price, and for those looking to collect a physical copy, you'll be able to pick one up for $49.99, though the added cost also gives you "<em>a selection of bonus goodies exclusively for retail,"</em> according to a press release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1As5O96S4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Yooka-Replaylee is built to shine on every platform, and we’re chuffed to bits it’s on Switch 2 from day 01, it holds a special place in our hearts (and hands)</em>," said Playtonic studio director Gavin Price. "<em>It’s bigger, brighter, bolder, and packed with all the little touches we always dreamed of. We can’t wait for players to jump in</em>."</p>



<p>Chief marketing officer at publisher PM Studios, Ami Blaire, added "<em>It's rare to see a game get this kind of second life - not as a remaster, but as a true reinvention. It's</em> <em>the kind of release that reminds you why I fell in love with platform games in the first place."</em></p>



<p>Yooka-Replaylee does more than just add a fresher coat of paint to Yooka-Laylee. Elements of the story are retold, new story beats are added, the minigames of the original are removed and replaced with new isometric platforming challenges. There's new stuff to collect, revisions to camera and movement controls, a new soundtrack, and a new map to help you move through the adventure.</p>



<p>It doesn't necessarily feel like a remake; more like a 'take two' at the game, with how much is changed and added. We'll get to see how it compares to the first game when it arrives in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The immersive attraction, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em>, is coming to the US. The Toronto-based Vibrant Studios has announced it will be bringing its full immersive-theatre-meets-multimedia experience to fantasy fans this Fall.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.vibrantstudios.events/en/dndimmersive" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> is a fully immersive experience where you can act out the thrill of being on a heroic adventure in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. You choose your class: Druid, Rogue, Fighter, or Wizard,&nbsp; embark on a quest from the famous Yawning Portal tavern, explore a dungeon, and face overcoming challenges.</p>

In addition to the interactive theatre of being an adventurer, the venue will include a marketplace, soundscapes, cinematic videos, <em>D&amp;D</em>-themed food and beverages, and more.

<p>The experience is open not just for singles, but for families, students, and can even accommodate school and group gatherings.

Cosplay is permitted but must not promote hate speech or be deemed publicly inappropriate.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> isn't the first time the iconic fantasy setting has been brought to life in the US.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-review-in-progress.1284456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Visual Concepts’ long-running NBA 2K series mirrors the careers of players it works so hard to emulate. Sometimes, it’s a flash of potential: a hotshot rookie catching fire after putting up duds in consecutive games. Others, it’s more comparable to a wily veteran nearing retirement – we see a glimpse of talent, that peek into what it could still be. That’s what keeps me, for better or worse, hoping for the best as I start playing NBA 2K26. It’s both flashy and old school, like a “how do you do, fellow kids” teacher who wears different Jordans to class every day, it has enough cool new kicks, fits, and gimmicks to make it a much more interesting and enjoyable experience than last year’s entry, even after spending only a dozen hours with it so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, “cool” probably isn’t the right word to describe that teacher, let alone NBA 2K26. After all, an annual sports game is obviously not going to be a radically new game, since most of its gameplay and mechanics are fundamentally similar to last year’s iteration, and the one before that, and so on. But in the context of the genre it’s made a good first impression, because several minor improvements cumulatively make such a huge difference to the whole that I’m willing to say it and risk being called a nerd. Yes, I am talking about the new-and-improved shot meter. As always, one of the smallest components in its vast hardwood floor of dribbling and criss-crossing parts leaves a massive influence on how just about everything else on the court plays out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Green and Slightly Curved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were lucky enough not to have experienced last year’s shot meter, I envy you. In place of the nightmare-inducing dial/arrow/ring design from 2K25, NBA 2K26 features a much more intuitive, easier-to-time, and infinitely better-curved bar shot meter. If you’ve heard that before, it’s because it’s similar to 2K23’s – but this isn’t entirely a reversion to that. Instead of remaining static, the new meter’s green field adjusts based on defensive coverage: if a defender is right up in your face, you’ll have practically no chance of making the shot. But if you’re open, it’ll be much easier to time the release right and make a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trust me, I’m having so much more fun shooting jumpers now than I was this time last year because I’m actually making them consistently. There is a slight tradeoff, though: because it’s easier to get greens, there’s also less room for imperfection. Meaning if you get a slightly early or slightly late timing, you might as well start running back on defense because the shot will more than likely brick. That said, I’ll take this shot meter any day of the week over a barely improved chance to make mistimed shots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I’m a big believer in the concept of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” because why ruin a good thing, right? But I’m an even bigger believer that if something is broke – like last year’s janky player movement – you b7etter get to fixin’ quick. Visual Concepts did just that because NBA 2K26 makes running, cutting, and defending so much smoother that it makes NBA 2K25’s motion feel like you were stuck running in quicksand. This is no small change because it permeates every single mode, making the entirety of NBA 2K26 feel less robotic and far more natural and enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, it makes one of my favorite new features, Go-To Post Shots, look even more accurate and realistic. Remember in last year’s review how disappointed I was that I couldn’t dominate the paint with Jokic’s or Embiid’s shimmy shake fade-aways? Well, dreams do come true because for the past day I have been spamming the Sombor Shuffle an ungodly amount of times in each match I play. It is a delightfully methodical, bruising alternative to the agile, quick-twitch motions of the typical Go-To Moves, and I will continue using it until the AI learns to stop it. Until then, it’s barbecue chicken alert each time down the floor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the bad news. What, you thought it was going to be all good from here on out? Sorry, Dorothy, but the years haven’t been kind to this yellow brick road. And by “yellow brick road,” I mean NBA 2K26’s offline-only modes. Last year, the so-called improvements to MyNBA were underwhelming, to say the least. This time, dear friends, they are practically non-existent, and, as an offline-mode truther, I am very disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 2K25 we at least had the addition of the Steph Era, even though it already felt redundant alongside two other eras in the 2010s (in addition to the LeBron Era). Are you ready to hear what the 2K26 MyNBA modes have in store? Drumroll, ple…you know what, don’t even bother. It’s called Offseason Scenarios for MyGM. These are tailor-made, long-term quests for each franchise that you must fulfill to appease the fanbase and, more importantly, <em>the owner</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These scenarios come in threes and are given out at the beginning of the offseason. But much like my issues with last year’s MyGM mode, these tasks (and many of the features in the mode itself) again feel forced and, at times, unrealistic. The RPG elements, with their perk and attribute point systems, seem out of place and unnecessary because they hardly make a difference in the grand scheme of basketball operations. At the end of the day, it’s still all about winning as many games and championships as you can. Or, if you’re on the other end of the spectrum, losing and tanking as much as possible. Overall, the whole mode feels like a side project hastily thrown together just to get that last bit of extra credit needed to pass the class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite my problems with its offline-only modes, the fundamental gameplay tweaks show plenty of promise in what I’ve played on my first day with it. I’m especially excited to see how it looks in MyCareer with its new-and-improved storyline, as well as in the potentially wonky online gameplay of MyTeam. But after suffering through last year’s shot meter and molasses-like movement, there really is nowhere to go but up. Whether that shows in my final verdict and score next week, though, remains to be seen.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"If you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From Calorie Mate snacks to hidden Kerotan frog statues, 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3 was packed with varied real-life Easter eggs, even if they contradicted the game’s 1960s setting. One memorable gimmick for eagle-eyed players to spot in the indoor areas of MGS3 (and MGS2) was the posters of current Japanese gravure idols — female models who pose in revealing outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These sexy posters make a return in the remake <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> — with an added twist. If you play on Legacy Style mode, the posters are as they were in the original. But if you are playing using the New Style mode, with its modern over-the-shoulder camera angle, you’ll notice that although the models are the same, the photos have been swapped out for recent shots of what they look like now, two decades on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50274" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a> (and previously reported on by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-updates-the-original-games-sexy-posters-with-recent-photos-of-the-same-gravure-models/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), the developers at Konami revealed how this change came about. They say that their aim with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was to evolve the game while staying true to the core essence of the original MGS3, and recreate its jungle setting so that it looked extremely realistic. However, they also ended up making small, unexpected tweaks to the content of the original, with the gravure posters being one such tweak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, the initial plan for the model posters was to use higher resolutions of the images used in MGS3. However, once the team had decided to implement a Legacy Mode and a New Mode, they hit upon the idea of changing up the gravure posters to reflect the 21 years that have passed since MGS3’s initial release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta’s creative producer Yuji Korekado (who also worked on the original MGS3) explained that for New Style mode, the team decided to reach out to the models that featured in MGS3 and ask them to send in new, recent photos. This does not mean that all the models are decked out in bikinis, though. Rather, the team asked them to simply send in pictures of how they look now. According to Korekado, every single model from the original sent in photos that span the gauntlet from sexy swimsuit shots to family snaps. “We would like players to seek out and find all the different types of photos,” said Korekado, with series producer Noriaki Okamoto adding that “if you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MGS3 also featured issues of real-life video game and glamour magazines that you could amusingly use to distract guards (the magazines featured differed depending on the region). However, Korekado said that the decision was made not to update these magazine covers, as many of the publications that popped up as items in MGS3 have since ceased publication. So, the real-life mags that you could find in MGS3 remain the same in both versions of Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Korekado also expresses gratitude towards all the people that returned to work on the remake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson has announced his new game&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which he and his company HumaNature Studios describe as a "life sim about finding joy from grief".</p>

<p>Set in a small Thai village,&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>casts you as Mai, a young girl who loses both of her parents in an accident. When she meets Pim, a ghost who can't remember who she was in life or how she died, the two must set out on a journey to "process their identities".</p>

<p>Johnson got the idea for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>following the sad and untimely passing of his daughter at just 28 years old, as well as "his family's loss of everything in the 2023 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Maui-wildfires-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lahaina fires</a>", according to a press release announcing the game.</p>

<p>To make&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, Johnson sought the aid of local artists Ferrai Duanghathai and Tanta Voratawankul, as well as the Thai Bit Egg animation studio and "long-time" Indonesian collaborator Ferry Halim, so it's got some serious authenticity behind it.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms, Johnson says you can expect the "chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village" in which you'll help villagers with their problems, earn karma, and play "cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story". It's got serious&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spirirfarer-review" rel="nofollow">Spiritfarer</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes, so if you love that game, you may well like this one too.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which gives a good sense of what the game will look like in motion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>debuts on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch sometime next year, and if you want to help support its development, there'll be a Kickstarter campaign to contribute to in October.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/battlefield-6-dev-apologizes-for-requiring-secure-boot-to-power-anti-cheat-tools/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-dev-apologizes-for-requiring-secure-boot-to-power-anti-cheat-tools.1284417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">announced</a> that players in its <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta on PC would <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">have to enable Secure Boot</a> in their Windows OS and BIOS settings. That decision proved controversial among players who weren't able to get the finicky low-level security setting working on their machines and others who were unwilling to allow EA's anti-cheat tools to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/eas-new-anti-cheat-tools-dip-into-the-dreaded-kernel-mode/">once again</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ring-0-of-fire-does-riot-games-new-anti-cheat-measure-go-too-far/">kernel-level access</a> to their systems.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Battlefield 6</em> technical director Christian Buhl is defending that requirement as something of a necessary evil to combat cheaters, even as he apologizes to any potential players that it has kept away.</p>
<p>"The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end">said in an interview with Eurogamer</a>. "It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play: that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p>
<p>Throughout the interview, Buhl admits that even requiring Secure Boot won't completely eradicate cheating in <em>Battlefield 6</em> long term. Even so, he offered that the Javelin anti-cheat tools enabled by Secure Boot's low-level system access were "some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating. Again, nothing makes cheating impossible, but enabling Secure Boot and having kernel-level access makes it so much harder to cheat and so much easier for us to find and stop cheating."</p>
<h2>Too much security, or not enough?</h2>
<p>When announcing the Secure Boot requirement in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/600785827026563959/">a Steam forum post</a> prior to the open beta, EA explained that having Secure Boot enabled "provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process." Having access to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/how-to-go-from-stolen-pc-to-network-intrusion-in-30-minutes/">Trusted Platform Module</a> on the motherboard via Secure Boot provides the anti-cheat team with visibility into things like kernel-level cheats and rootkits, memory manipulation, injection spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, the use of virtual machines, and attempts to tamper with anti-cheat systems, the company wrote.</p>
