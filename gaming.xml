			<p>EA Sports FC 26 arrived <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">last month on September 26, 2025</a>, and in less than two weeks from its arrival on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, according to a report from <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/alineaanalytics/p/septembers-top-playstation-games?r=1h8120&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">Alinea Analytics</a>, the latest iteration of EA's annual football game has already sold <strong>10 million copies</strong> across all platforms in less than two weeks.</p>



<p>That's the kind of start you can't exactly scoff at, even for a title like EA Sports FC, which is expected to hit these kinds of sales numbers, and more, every year. According to the report, 60% of those 10 million copies sold came from PlayStation players. </p>



<p>Beyond EA Sports FC, Alinea Analytics also reports that September was a sports-focused month, with NBA 2K26 being the other top-selling game for the month, hitting over 6 million copies since its debut, with 2 million of those coming from PlayStation players in September.</p>



<p>In the number three spot, below EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26 for September's best-selling games on PlayStation, is where Borderlands 4 landed, while Hollow Knight Silksong came in at the number four spot. Other notable inclusions in the top-10 best-selling games on PlayStation for September 2025 include Silent Hill f at number 10, Dying Light: The Beast at number eight, EA Sports FC 25 at number seven, and Grand Theft Auto V at number five.</p>



<p>Of those titles, Wccftech reviewed Dying Light: The Beast and Silent Hill f. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">the former, we wrote that</a>, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go </em><em>splat.</em>"</p>



<p>And <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">for the latter, we wrote</a>, "<em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em>"</p>

After announcing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">50 percent price increase to Game Pass Ultimate</a> last week, Microsoft now says this price increase will only currently affect new purchases and not existing subscribers in markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India.</p><p>“At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan,” explains Microsoft in an email that was sent to some Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers overnight. “Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate.”</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has verified that the email is genuine and from Microsoft.</p><p>The change in these countries is likely related to local regulations on subscription price changes, and it means in Ireland existing subscribers with auto-renew enabled will still be charged at the €17.99 monthly rate, instead of the new €26.99 pricing. Microsoft notes in its email that existing subscribers in these markets will be notified “at least 60 days in advance” of price changes, meaning the changes won’t go into effect for at least two more months.</p><p>The halt in price increases in select markets is a change to what Microsoft announced last week. “This updated pricing will go into effect on October 1st for new subscribers, and then at the next billing cycle, likely to be November 4th, for current subscribers,” said Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em> last week.</p><p>The price hikes still appear to be in place for existing subscribers in the UK and US, though. I’ve reached out to Microsoft to comment on the price hike changes, and we’ll update you accordingly.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Recreate Marvel’s Most Iconic Moments</h2>
<p>Lego recreated that one slow-mo shot used in all the trailers. It’s the one in the opening scene from the movie as the Avengers are storming Hydra’s snow base and they all momentarily are all leaping through the air while busting through trucks and trees and whatnot. The first Avengers film had that tracking shot in the middle of Manhattan, circling around the heroes. Avengers: Age of Ultron had this.</p>
<p>The 613-piece Lego sets features favorite Avengers minifigures including the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner. I mean Hawkeye. Designed for kids 10-years-old and up, this Lego Marvel set has some interactive elements. Simulate the Hulk’s explosive power and strength with the bunker that launches into the air. A push-along road vehicle is included. The set includes a variety of transparent stands so each of the Avengers can be suspended in air in the middle of the action, making it all feel dramatic and dynamic.</p>



<p>The whole set is reconfigurable to your liking. You can built it to spec, making the frame of the 2015 film to a T or, I don’t know, stick Iron Man and Captain America in the humvee to act out Tony teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. Buy a Batman minifigure and pretend he is in the Avengers, teaching Cap how to drive before his road test. That’s the magic of Lego.</p>
<p>The Lego Marvel The Avengers Assemble: Age of Ultron makes a great gift for a Marvel fan of any age. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4595/">Get it now while it’s on sale for $30 off, bringing the price down to just $70 for a limited time.</a></p>

Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p><ul><li><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</li><li><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</li><li><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>First Stop: Planet Tephra</strong></p><p>The first destination for intrepid Astroneers is Tephra, a lush and mysterious planet deep in frontier space. Its tangled jungles, vast oceans and cavernous depths hold secrets, and more than a few hazards.</p><p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger <a title="Genres > Co-Op [339 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> missions.</p><p>And Tephra is just the beginning. As the Starseeker travels deeper into frontier space, the crew will uncover new worlds, each bringing its own dangers, creatures and stories tied to the Fronteer Force’s Super Top-Secret Mission mission. It’s a big mission.</p><p><strong>First Look at an Expedition</strong></p><p>In the <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> Direct demo, a Squad touched down on Tephra to help repair critical equipment for the science team. Simple enough, until it wasn’t. Local fauna had Gooped everything in sight, forcing recruits to improvise with their EXO Tools and specialized Nozzles. Nozzles are modular upgrades that transform the way explorers interact with the environment.</p><p>The Squad’s mission required the team to set up a comms relay high up on Tephra’s cliffs, all while cleaning Goop from machinery using Water Hose Nozzles, contending with rowdy creatures, and escaping the planet before time ran out. Of course, detours were made for Carrotling-chasing, Squad hijinks and general chaos. After all, what’s a Starseeker expedition without a little creative disaster?</p><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> will bring players deeper into the <em>ASTRONEER</em> universe. Whether you’re a meticulous planner, a curious explorer or just someone who really likes throwing beach balls in space, the Starseeker has a seat for you.</p></blockquote><p><em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,565 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,055 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, Switch, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,475 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454370/STARSEEKER_Astroneer_Expeditions/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the video below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Reveal</span></h2><p><iframe title="STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions | Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5lw4PJtHmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions-gameplay-reveal-video-details]]></content:encoded>

U Deluxe is a remaster of the old Wii U title from 2012. It offers updated graphics, the New Super Luigi U expansion, new items, and other quality-of-life upgrades. You'll get to explore over 160 levels through nine unique worlds, each with its own enemies, aesthetics, and power-ups. Part of what makes the game so fun is its cooperative play, which allows up to four players to tackle its 2D levels together. For players new to platformers, they can play as Nabbit (who is practically invincible and makes it easy for newcomers to learn the ropes).</span></p></div>                      </div><p>As a bonus, you'll find three additional game modes--Boost Rush, Challenges, and Coin Battle--offering plenty of replay value once you've made it through the core content. The game is always an easy recommendation for Mario fans, but at this new price, it's the ideal time to cross it off your wishlist. New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe has only dropped below this price point a few times since its release--and with this deal expiring at the end of Big Deal Days on October 8, be sure to check it out soon.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review-its-a-me-agai/1900-6417061/" data-ref-id="1900-6417061">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe review</a> gave it a solid 7/10, due to its smooth platforming and inventive level design.</p><p>"Despite its aging formula, New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe is still a great entry in the series, with its typically tight platforming and both accessibility and depth to spare," wrote critic Oscar Dayus. "While it can feel a bit stale for those who have been round the Mushroom Kingdom one too many times before, Deluxe is well worth playing, especially if you didn't get a chance to play NSMBU on Wii U."</p><p>Of course, this isn't the only Switch game on sale during Amazon's shopping event.

It pulls together both Kingdom Battle and Sparks of Hope for $25 (was $30), and they're bound to keep you busy for quite some time. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-hits-lowest-price-of-the-year/1100-6535278/" data-ref-id="1100-6535278">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD</a> is also listed for $40 (was $60), which is also its best price of 2025.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-a-second-price-drop-in-three-days-the-2025-rog-strix-g15-has-just-reached-a-new-record-low.1318927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a gaming laptop means balancing several critical factors: <strong>you need a powerful GPU</strong> that can handle modern games at high settings, <strong>a fast processor</strong> that won’t bottleneck performance, <strong>enough RAM</strong> for smooth multitasking, and a <strong>display with a high refresh rate</strong> that keeps up with fast-paced action. The ASUS ROG Strix G16 checks every box with its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU powered by the new Blackwell architecture, Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 165Hz display. This 2025 model has already seen a price drop recently, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/">Amazon just pushed it to a new all-time low of $1,199, down from $1,499</a>. That’s also $300 off and cheaper than the 2024 model currently sells for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RTX 5060 GPU is a major step ahead due to <strong>the Nvidia Blackwell architecture</strong>: It introduces DLSS 4 technology, which employs AI to create additional frames and accelerate performance without compromise to visual fidelity. Practically, you are free to play demanding games such as Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2 at increased settings with smooth frame rates. The technologies for Max-Q aim for optimal power efficiency so the laptop produces muscular performance without overwhelming heat and fan noise. Ray tracing creates incredibly realistic lighting, reflections and shadows, and it enhances the visual experience for games supporting it.</p>
<h2>Processing Power and Memory Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-14650HX is a hybrid processor featuring 16 cores: <strong>8 performance cores for demanding tasks and 8 efficiency cores for background processes</strong>. This architecture means the laptop can handle gaming while simultaneously running Discord, streaming software, or browser tabs without stuttering. The base clock speeds reach up to 2.2 GHz, with <strong>boost frequencies climbing to 5.2 GHz</strong> when you need maximum power for intense gaming sessions or content creation work like video editing.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of DDR5-5.6GHz memory provides fast memory access</strong> to maintain smooth operation of everything. DDR5 is significantly faster than DDR4, reducing load times and delivering increased frame stability for memory-intensive games. The<strong> 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD provides ample storage</strong> for your game collection and serves up read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s.</p>



<p>It uses a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of a typical 16:9, and gives it extra vertical screen estate useful for gaming and productivity work. The FHD+ resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a sensible compromise between image sharpness and performance, as more demanding resolutions would involve extra stress on the GPU. Smooth motion during a bullet blaster or a racing game is <strong>provided by a refresh rate of 165Hz</strong> and motion blur and ghosting are eliminated by a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>The ROG <em>Intelligent Cooling</em> is where ASUS shows off its engineering expertise: <strong>End-to-end vapor chamber spreads heat across a larger surface</strong>&nbsp;and tri-fan technology exhausts more air through the case. Employing Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the chipset, rather than typical thermal paste, transfers heat more efficiently, retaining lower temperatures even during longer gaming sessions. Advanced cooling equates to a laptop operating at its highest potential, rather than thermal throttling.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for Prime members during its current Prime Big Deal Day sale, you are getting 2025’s current gaming technology at a sub-last-year’s-model cost.</p>

With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans said they’d had enough of what they called the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback"><u>it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</u></a>. This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a positive reaction to the Predator in Black Ops 6, although some are saying they wish he was coming to Black Ops 7 instead. “See I’m perfectly fine when COD does collabs with other mature IPs,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1nzzf9r/comment/ni67u27/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor blackviking147</a>. “The Mil-spawn skin is still the only time I was genuinely interested in finishing a COD battle pass and I use it in Warzone to this day ‘cause it’s voiced by Keith David.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Predator, Rambo, Die Hard, Spawn all of those were amazing collabs that didn't destroy the game’s identity ‘cause they're movie properties from around the game’s time period and or decked out in milsim gear so it stays in the aesthetic.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would have been great to use this skin in Blops 7,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1nzzf9r/comment/ni5wwfb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added LaylaLegion</a>. “Oh well.

Despite the online chatter, there are a number of Call of Duty players who have expressed frustration that their goofy skins won’t carry forward into Black Ops 7, lamenting the fact they won’t get the amount of use out of their purchases that they'd expected. Now, if these players move on to Black Ops 7, they will have to leave those expensive virtual items behind — including the Predator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p>“My game literally crashed when they all started rolling in,” they wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1nqrbys/comment/ng91mr8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">comment</a> on Reddit. “It was the most successful moment of a game breaking ever for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">That moment summed up the excitement around Hades 2 finally leaving Early Access. After more than a year of updates, patches, and community feedback, Supergiant’s follow-up to its award-winning roguelike is fully out. For players who have already spent hundreds of hours with Melinoë, it means their progress now carries the weight of an official release. For newcomers, it’s the chance to step into one of the most anticipated sequels in recent memory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581640"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581640-1145350_55.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Supergiant didn’t just flip the switch and call it a day. The 1.0 launch came with a long list of changes: dozens of balance tweaks, new relationship events between characters, fresh art, and even a brand-new song performed by Scylla, one of the game’s underworld bosses. Many fans decided to start fresh saves to experience the full scope of the game from the beginning, taking in the final version of its story and mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The community has also carried over some quirks from the Early Access era. One infamous example involves Chronos, the Titan of Time and one of the game’s central villains. During his boss fight, pausing wasn’t an option. If players tried to hit pause, Chronos would interrupt.</p><p dir="ltr">“Excuse me?” he’d sneer before unpausing the game himself. “Time does not stop at your behest. It only stops at mine.” It was a clever design flourish that ended up being removed after community pushback, but veterans still laugh about it--especially when new players run into him for the first time.</p><p>Beyond these details, Hades 2 feels distinct from its predecessor in both pacing and progression. The combat remains fast and chaotic, but there’s a slower rhythm at its core. Melinoë’s cast ability encourages zoning tactics, creating circles that can be powered up with boons, while charge attacks force players to weigh timing and positioning.</p><p dir="ltr">Progression has also taken a strategic step forward. Instead of Hades’ Mirror of Night, which offered linear unlocks, players now work with Arcana cards--a system that opens up branching build paths. Some cards completely subvert series staples. The Strength card, modeled after Heracles, offers increased damage and defense if players give up Death Defiance, the extra lives that were critical in the original game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581639" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581639"></a><figcaption>Hades 2 run recap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4581639-1145350_61.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">“I went Strength and never looked back,” one player, Rhuemis, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1nsop35/comment/ngnfkgu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a>. “Losing Death Defiances used to psyche me out too much, so getting rid of them made things way more fun and a lot easier for me personally.”</p><p dir="ltr">These changes all build toward what players have been waiting for since Early Access began: Hade 2's true ending. Within hours of release, veterans unlocked the final story beat for Melinoë, and discussion threads quickly filled with reactions to the payoff. For longtime fans, it’s the conclusion to more than a year of anticipation. For first-timers, it’s a chance to discover why Supergiant’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-years-on-the-hades-fanbase-built-its-own-greek-mythology/1100-6534791/" data-ref-id="1100-6534791">take on Greek mythology</a> remains one of the most acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-changes-what-it-means-to-be-a-roguelike/1100-6483420/" data-ref-id="1100-6483420">roguelikes ever made</a>.</p>

                <p>Square Enix recently announced that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/" data-ref-id="1100-6534646">will be coming to Switch 2 and Xbox</a>--and with it, new "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-stable-despite-xbox-technical-concerns-director-says/1100-6535199/" data-ref-id="1100-6535199">streamlined progression features</a>." These are essentially cheats that let players skip the grind and finish the game much more quickly. The idea is to make the experience smoother and more accessible, especially for people playing it for the first time.</p><p>The decision to add these features came directly from game director Naoki Hamaguchi. In an interview with (and translated by) <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, he explained that he pushed hard for their inclusion. His reasoning? He believes players should have the freedom to enjoy games however they want, whether that's taking their time or speeding through the story.</p><p>"Naturally, when we announce features like these, we get responses like, 'This is sacrilegious!'" Hamaguchi said. "Even within the dev team, there are people who feel that way. But unless someone takes the initiative, it doesn't happen."</p><p>He went on to add that in today's world of digital entertainment, giving players options is key. "I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That's why I pushed for it."</p><p>Hamaguchi also pointed out that these features can significantly shorten playtime, condensing a 40-50 hour game down to under 10 hours. He said the timing made sense because Remake is already a few years old, and the goal is to help new players catch up before the final part of the trilogy arrives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has unexpectedly released an animated short film on its YouTube channel. The film, titled&nbsp;<em>Close to You,</em> centers on a baby and its seemingly sentient pacifier.&nbsp;</p><p>Running shy of four minutes, the wordless film centers on a blonde-haired baby who, after their mother leaves them alone in their room, chases their pacifier around the room after it suddenly comes to life. The video’s description lacks any explanation and only states the film’s title (with the comments section deactivated as well). Nintendo’s social media posts and the Nintendo Today app are similarly devoid of any information about the animation.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsufGY5I8jA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsufGY5I8jA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While it’s unclear if the animated short is tied to any existing or upcoming game, fellow <em>Game Informer</em> editor Charles Harte noticed the short’s lively piano soundtrack is a slightly altered version of the main Pikmin theme. Editor Wesley LeBlanc also adds that Pikmin are canonically invisible to the human eye, as confirmed in the mobile title Pikmin Bloom.&nbsp;It would certainly explain why the baby's pacifier and blocks would suddenly come to life – other than magic, of course.&nbsp;</p><p>Some fans online have also speculated that<em> Close to You</em> is tied to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hits-theaters-in-april"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, and that this child is a baby Rosalina, given they share the same hair and somewhat similar eye color. The blue shirt could be a nod to Rosalina's signature blue gown.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think of <em>Close to You</em>, and do you believe it's related to Pikmin or any other Nintendo property? Is it conneted to a video game at all?

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/futurlabs-powerwash-simulator-2-gets-a-switch-2-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/futurlabs-powerwash-simulator-2-gets-a-switch-2-release-date.1318885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/powerwash-simulator-2-blasts-the-dirt-off-your-switch-2-this-autumn">we reported</a> not long ago, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, the cunningly-named sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/powerwash_simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, is winging its way to Switch 2, which is a very good thing indeed given how popular the first outing was.</p>
<p>Now, the folks over at Futurlab have announced that their cleaning sim sequel will release on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>. Hey, that's this month!</p>
<p>To get us in the mood for the adventure to come, the Brighton-based UK dev has also released a training video, which you can find at the top of this very article, and you should definitely pay close attention to it. Power-washing is a very serious business, after all.</p>
<p>In this follow-up, besides the returning Muckingham, players will also be set base-building tasks and other unique activities in all-new locations, "from retro roller discos to campfires, mining trucks and a suspiciously large novelty teapot", it says here.</p>
<p>Here are some further deets from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The jobs and water keep flowing in PowerWash Simulator 2. Play through a fresh new campaign, uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries. Plus, venture even further out to brand-new grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.</p>
<p><strong>KEY FEATURES RECAP:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer</strong> – Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online – all with shared progression.</p>
<p><strong>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift</strong> – Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Don’t worry – fall damage doesn’t exist here.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Stage Jobs</strong> – Just when you think you’ve finished, surprise: there’s more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</p>
<p><strong>Home Base Customisation</strong> – Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</p>
<p><strong>Career Mode</strong> – Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</p>
<p><strong>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools</strong> – Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</p>
<p><strong>Cat Companions</strong> – Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 launches October 23rd and costs <strong>$24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99</strong> (or whatever that might equate to where you are).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%99s-player-count-on-steam-hit-a-record-low-ahead-of-coming-star-wars-expansion.1318882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To say that Bungie has had a bad couple of years would be an understatement, in many ways. Despite the small boost that came along with Destiny 2: The Final Shape,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/"> layoffs</a>, scandals <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">around stolen work</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">reports of poor and greedy leadership</a> overshadow anything positive the studio has going on.</p>



<p>The latest negative tally to add to the pile comes from a report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-steam-franchise-history-bungie-trust/">The Game Post</a>, which points to Destiny 2's <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660#1m">Steam Chart numbers</a>, which hit an all-time low for the game since its release on Steam in 2019. It should be said that Steam numbers aren't everything, but it's still not necessarily a good look for Destiny 2 to be in such a low place <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">after the recent launch of its Edge of Fate expansion</a>, and ahead of a very major <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">Star Wars expansion called Renegades</a>, which is due out this coming December.</p>



<p>Per the Steam Charts, Destiny 2's monthly average was 18,349 players when The Game Post published its report. At the time of this writing, the average is listed at 18,100 players for the last 30 days.</p>



<p>Is a Star Wars expansion the medicine Bungie needs for Destiny 2 to turn player counts like this around? It could be. Technically, anything is possible. Whether it will is an entirely different question. Even if the idea of wielding a lightsaber gets players to pick Destiny 2 back up, or even to try it for the first time, one of the game's lasting issues has been how obtuse it is to get into or get back into, even if you are a returning player.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, the studio just yesterday announced that it is hosting <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">a closed technical test for Marathon that players can sign up for</a>, and Pete Parsons, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">who was at the studio's helm for years, has left his role and retired</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tell me if this has ever happened to you. You and you’re friends are out having fun and you want to snap a quick group photo, or maybe something crazy is happening in front of you and you feel the need to record it. You pull out your phone, open the camera app, and then a little pop-up says your storage is full and that it can’t take any new photos. Then you frantically scrub through your camera roll looking for things okay to delete only for them to still not be enough somehow, and then the moment has passed.</p>
<p>Managing phone storage can be a nightmare, especially for those of us still carrying pics from over 10 years ago. There is a solution that is not upgrading to a larger capacity phone or paying a huge monthly fee for cloud storage. SanDisk has an SSD designed for use with phones which happens to be on sale for Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Day. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/">On October 7 and October 8, you can save $25 on the 1TB SSD (comes to $110) or $37 on the 2TB SSD (comes to $170).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4590/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Record on Your Phone to the Drive</h2>
<p>This SanDisk external SSD has been made specifically for use with your phone. It connects over USB-C meaning its compatible on any iPhone 15 and up and can then record photos and videos directly to the drive. The drive uses exFAT formatting which means it’s compatible with Windows, Android, and macOS devices right out of the box.</p>
<p>The Creator Phone SSD is even shaped to fit snuggly on the back of your Phone without being visible from the front. It uses MagSafe so it actually magnetically connects to the back of your phone, staying firmly in place while in use.</p>



<p>Along with recording new footage or photography onto the drive, you can also transfer stuff already on your camera roll to the drive or vice versa. Great for if you want spend an afternoon clearing out some of your old photos without getting rid of them to just make room new ones.</p>
<p>The drive really shines for for creators who frequently record video using their phone be it for work or otherwise. You can shoot in Apple ProRes 4K at 60 fps when paired with an iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max or iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. Great for long shoots and then you already have the video files on a drive that can easily be transferred to your PC or Mac.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, a US patent expert stated that Nintendo is incorrect in its assertion that mods do not count as prior art. </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, Nintendo and Pocketpair have been engaged in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-has-acquired-2-more-anti-palworld-patents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent infringement lawsuit</a> for some time now, with the former claiming that the latter has infringed multiple patents with Palworld. Now, a US Patent expert has provided their opinion on the ongoing lawsuit and also on mods not being considered as prior art. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-saying-mods-not-counting-is-prior-art-is-the-most-asinine-thing-i-have-seen">Nintendo Saying Mods Not Counting is Prior Art “Is the Most Asinine Thing I Have Seen” </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-us-ip-expert-says-nintendo-claiming-mods-dont-invalidate-its-pokemon-patents-is-just-a-loser-argument-and-a-hail-mary-in-its-ongoing-legal-fight-with-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+,</a> during a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Nusug2SfA&amp;t=211s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Junglist</a>, Kirk Sigmon, an attorney from Banner Witcoff, and an expert in patent law, spoke about Nintendo’s defense on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-argues-invalidity-and-non-infringement-against-nintendos-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mods not counting as prior art</a>. Sigmon started off by stating that “Nintendo is so wrong it hurts”. Sigmon added that there might be some nuance in Japanese law that could dictate where Nintendo is coming from; however, for the world of prior art, it doesn’t have to be perfect, nor does it have to be functional either. </p>



<p>Sigmon then went on to explain instances where prior art has been used that isn’t a computer program in the first place. He also provided an example of an IPR case from 5-7 years ago, where a Dungeons and Dragons manual was used as prior art, as it included character sheets and other details. He adds that “you don’t have to find prior art that’s of a specific nature”, it doesn’t have to be marketed either. Most of the time, the only requirement is that “it was written down somewhere” to prove that it existed. </p>



<p>The patent expert goes on to say, “Nintendo’s argument that mods are somehow different, to me is the most asinine thing i have seen”. For it seems like it’s coming from someone “who doesn’t understand computers at all”. According to Sigmon’s POV, mods are essential, but they are a very dangerous space at the same time. However, “if you are creating a mod for a game that has certain functionality, that’s all that matters.” </p>



<p>Sigmon goes on to conclude that there have been several references used in patent offices as well as litigation that were never actually made and had numerous flaws, but that doesn’t prevent them from being prior art in the United States. There might be a nuance in Japanese law that he may not be aware of. In general, Sigmon thinks Nintendo’s argument about mods not being prior art “is a loser”. It is “fixated too highly on form over function” because where to we “end that dispute, as there are multiple Unreal Engine 5, are those mods too just cause they are running on a singular engine? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New information on pricing and launch weapons for Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has been leaked online. These details from a known Destiny 2 and Marathon data miner include details on the game’s pricing, season pass, and even launch weapons.</p>



<p>In a series of posts on social media, Colony Deaks says that the game will launch with two editions and remain a premium-priced title. </p>



<p>According to their posts, Marathon’s <strong>base price will be $40</strong>—which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-marathon-price-report-double-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a>–while the Deluxe Edition of the game will be <strong>“around $60”</strong>. The Deluxe Edition, they say, will include more skins for players and possibly more. There’s also a pre-order bonus that includes a Destiny ship, ghost, and sparrow, along with a weapon skin. Lastly, the Deluxe Edition will give players “around $30-ish worth of season pass tokens,” though they are unclear what the tokens will be for. </p>



<p>In addition to the game itself, Bungie is planning a season pass for the game that will be cosmetic only and cost “around $10”.</p>



<h2 id="h-plenty-of-weapons">Plenty Of Weapons</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Has it really been 25 years? Yes, my wizened friends, it has. Back in the year of our lord 2000 (or 1999 if you're from Japan), if you weren't still calming down from the trauma of Y2K (still can't believe nothing happened) you may have been getting completely sucked into one of the few truly amazing RPGs on the Nintendo 64. Because <em>you</em> are a person of lordly caliber. A top of the range model. No skimping on the quality ingredients in your sauce, champ.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/ogre_battle_64_person_of_lordly_caliber">Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber</a>, besides having a belter of a name, is also a game that had me — and I'm sure plenty more ancient N64 gamers besides — glued to my CRT screen when I should have been down the club dancing to...well, an S Club 7 remix or something.</p>
<p>This real-time strategy classic from Quest (who dissolved into Square Enix in 2003) sees players descend on the Holy Lodis Empire, where a bunch of bad guys are oppressing the people. It's up to you, through some delightful battling, to raise the revolutionary flag and fight back for the good of the people. Hey, we should try doing that in real life sometime!</p>

<p>The N64 had precious few outstanding RPG experiences of this type for players to enjoy, and certainly in comparison to other consoles of the time, so it's a good thing that Quest hit it so far out of the park we ended up giving it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/n64/ogre_battle_64_person_of_lordly_caliber">a 10/10 here at Nintendo Life</a>. Heck that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/03/ogre_battle_the_march_of_the_black_queen_virtual_console">one more than we scored</a> the first game, 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ogre_battle_the_march_of_the_black_queen">Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/tactics_ogre_let_us_cling_together">same score</a> we gave the legendary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/tactics_ogre_let_us_cling_together">Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</a> (both reviews for the Virtual Console versions, of course).</p>
<p>There's a quality mix here of a top-notch story and a battle setup that excels. In fact, having sat through a few hours to get reacquainted with it recently, it really does remain highly playable and enjoyable today, even if it does look and sound distinctly of, well, the Nintendo 64 era. Maybe that's a good thing!</p>
<p>For an adventure that includes no voice-acting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010330072003/http://www.nintendo.com/n64/ogrebattle3/index.html">according to Nintendo</a>, it was already the second-biggest N64 game, so it's lucky they didn't try to squeeze that in) whilst presenting its surprisingly affecting story entirely in-game rather than through naff cutscenes, Ogre Battle 64 excels because it makes the clever decision at the offset to remain grounded. Well, as grounded as something called Ogre Battle can be; its story is still relevant today, focusing on politics and issues that still affect us. It's immediate, it gets to the point and it underscores the action perfectly.</p>
<p>Taking place in the mining colony of Palatinus, the game tells the tale of people who've been abused and set to work in terrible conditions to the point that they finally rebel against the empire that's keeping them down. Magnus (that's the fella you play as) is initially dispatched as part of a force sent to quell revolutionary disturbances. But things don't exactly go to the Military's plan...</p>

<p>From here there are twists and turns aplenty to keep you involved, and it's surprising to see just how well-handled some of the more difficult topics are. The story keeps things real and they aren't glazed over, providing an emotional core that keeps it all ticking along very nicely.</p>
<p>All of this is tied to cracking battles of the Ogre Battle variety. The real-time scraps here involve sending out your dinky little troops (up to 50 men, women and beasts in total by the end), made up of the usual array of classes, to locations to gather up treasure, take over settlements and fight as they go. You arrange your selection of troops into a unit or "legion" placing class-types that work best at the front and back in suitable positions and so on and assigning a leader. These legions will then scrap against enemy groups.</p>
<p>Once you've been given your orders at the start of each mission, you'll set out to achieve an objective, and the game is quite free-wheeling in letting you get to this your own way. Battles kick off as and when you happen upon foes, the action plays out automatically, and it's up to you to ensure that you have your units in a setup that gives them the best chance to come out on top.</p>

<p>There's a lot of depth here, with loads of moves and skills to use against your opponents; you don't even necessarily have to physically defeat the enemy, just do enough to push them back and stop them gaining any ground, as you work to take over strongholds and dominate the map you are on by assuming control of towns and such forth. The fact that the battles are real-time helps add a frisson of urgency, and you can feel the desperation as you struggle to keep things moving your way. This is all then strengthened further by a clever 'Alignment' system, where your decisions and actions determine what ending of three you get to see.</p>
<p>Are you a man of honour who lets a defeated enemy live, or are you a bit of a bloodthirsty bad'un? Alignment goes so far as to affect the towns and settlements that you take over, as each one has its own set alignment rating. Match this and you'll be considered to have liberated the peoples there, rather than just having captured them all by force.</p>

<p>This adds plenty of replayability and considered thought processes to proceedings, especially for folks who get properly into the story. And get into it you should, because, besides the fun fighting, it's really the story and its handling of political matters that keeps this one up top as an all-timer. Ogre Battle 64 doesn't shy away from things; it's willing to have you question morals, and as a result it's got much more to say politically than plenty of modern efforts seem bothered with.</p>
<p>Is it still worth a playthrough today? Absolutely. If you can get over the slightly weathered looks and underwhelming sounds, there's plenty to recommend here, with engaging gameplay and a narrative that gets the old revolutionary blood pumping. Not that you'd need much help with that these days, most likely.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-brings-new-storyline-and-more-later-this-month.1318843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games have announced the first major&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>Early Access update, and it's coming to the tabletop adaptation later this month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Awakening Protocol update will serve as the first big content patch for the strategy RPG. Much of what it's bringing was first teased as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">roadmap announcement</a> back in early September.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting a new storyline in the form of the Unfettered arc, which will give you a chance to confront a "machine uprising" headed by a "mysterious and formidable leader".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=27OZZlwK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=IEsVKu4u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frosthaven</em>'s first major Early Access update will have you challenging a machine uprising.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the new storyline (about which Arc and Snapshot are remaining very tight-lipped for now), you can also expect three new playable heroes to be added to&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>in the Awakening Protocol update, and they come with "bold new strategies".</p>

<p>Five new bosses are coming as well, consisting of "mechanical and unknown horrors", so you'll need to make sure your squad is at its strongest if you want to beat them. That's in addition to over 18 new quests, a new building, and lots of other extras.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-video-game-adaptation-announced" rel="nofollow">video game adaptation</a> of the popular tabletop experience, which is itself a sequel to the iconic RPG&nbsp;<em>Gloomhaven</em>. For a time,&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frosthaven-kickstarter-is-most-funded-board-game-on-platform" rel="nofollow">most-funded tabletop project</a> on Kickstarter, before being overtaken by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">Brandon Sanderson's&nbsp;<em>Cosmere&nbsp;</em>RPG project</a>.</p>

<p>The video game version of&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>promises "challenging yet satisfying gameplay" across both its single-player and multiplayer offerings, as well as "deep mechanics" that should feel intuitive to both newcomers and experienced veterans of the tabletop game.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347080/Frosthaven/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and its Awakening Protocol update launches on October 23rd.

            <p>The world is insufficiently clean and sparkly, so here comes Futurlab with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2">Powerwash Simulator 2</a>. The floor-mopping bonanza will release on 23rd October, a few short weeks from now. The release date announcement accompanies one of those satirical "corporate training" videos, commonly used by videogame creators to sneer indirectly at the sad unfortunates trapped in their Skinner boxes. 
</p>
<p>The trailer comments of the sequel's new cleaning tools, for example, that "it all does basically the same thing, but it gives you a false sense of progression, even though you've really achieved nothing". Fine then, Futurlab. I was looking forward to your glorified adult colouring book. I was modestly anticipating the opportunity to absent myself from my personal squalor and while away some hours in your pseudo-therapeutic tribute to Mr Muscles. But now that you've ripped off the mask and explicitly told me that I'm an addled hamster, deserving only of contempt, I guess I'll buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3374840/Piss_Off/">this game about pissing on people instead</a>.

<p>For balance, the developers had plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-devs-tell-us-their-tips-for-real-life-house-cleaning">perfectly polite and genuinely helpful advice</a> to share with us about realworld cleaning in March. They all seem like lovely people. I cannot thank principal data analyst Russel Young enough for that tip about lemons and coffee mugs. I am less trustful of writer Mark Ginbey's comment about throwing ants on the floor.
</p>
<p>Satirical training video aside, the release date email includes a recap of the sequel's new features. Here you go.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer - Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online - all with shared progression.</li>
<li>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift - Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Don't worry - fall damage doesn't exist here.</li>
<li>Multi-Stage Jobs - Just when you think you've finished, surprise: there's more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</li>
<li>Home Base Customisation - Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</li>
<li>Career Mode - Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</li>
<li>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools - Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</li>
<li>Cat Companions - Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"A rare simulator that's focused on fun, not faff," wrote Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) in our original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> review from 2022. "I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is," he urged, stressfully. "This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore." I expect the second game will follow firmly in those soapy bootprints.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor-2000632587</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-clearing-out-its-tv-soundbar-now-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-any-direct-competitor.1318819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Quality soundbars for your TV can easily run $1,000 or more, which makes better audio feel like a luxury purchase. The Bose TV speaker breaks that pattern by delivering clear and improved sound at a fraction of that cost. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Normally priced at $279, this soundbar is now down to $199 for Prime Big Deal Day</a>, which marks an all-time low and only the second discount this year. Beyond improving your TV audio, <strong>it doubles as a Bluetooth speaker for your living room</strong> that you can control from your smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The underlying issue it addresses is easy: built-in TV speakers sound thin and muddy which causes dialogue to be difficult to follow and diminishes your enjoyment of shows and films. The Bose TV Speaker fixes it by <strong>employing two angled full-range drivers that produce a broader and more natural soundstage</strong>. Rather than having sound directly emanate at your face from one point, angled drivers reflect sound off your walls and bring it to life and opening it up, as it were.</p>
<h2>Dialogue Mode Makes Every Word Crystal Clear</h2>
<p>The dedicated dialogue enhancement feature is where we really see this soundbar excel for everyday listening. Bose designed the speaker to expressly zero in on vocal and pronunciation, and lifts dialogue out of the mix so that you can clearly hear each word without having to turn it up too high. There’s a remote included that has a button for a dialogue mode, which amplifies speech even more when desired. There’s also a bass boost mode for times when you want a deeper sound during music scenes or action scenes.</p>



<p>Setup only takes minutes due to a single-cable connection: <strong>Use your optical audio cable included, or connect via HDMI ARC if your TV is capable</strong> (HDMI cable not included). HDMI ARC provides a benefit of controlling soundbar volume by your TV’s remote for a seamless experience. Ultra-slim at just 2.21 inches high, 23.38 inches wide, and 4.02 inches deep, <strong>it fits seamlessly in front of nearly all TVs</strong>, neither covering nor obstructing IR sensor nor your view of the picture. It’s <strong>also wall mountable</strong> if a cleaner aesthetic is your preference, though brackets are separately available.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth connectivity offers convenience apart from TV sound: You <strong>are allowed to connect your smartphone, tablet, or laptop to stream music</strong>&nbsp;or even audiobooks directly through the soundbar’s sound output. The <strong>speaker stores a total of three devices</strong> via its multiple inputs: HDMI, optical and auxiliary. Whichever device is turned on first actually connects to it automatically, thereby never having to switch inputs manually each time.</p>
<p>At $199 for this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting sound engineering and construction of Bose for fewer dollars than are many budget soundbars which aren’t even CLOSE to providing clear and stereophonic sound like this one does.</p>

Now, less than a week later, news is coming out that not all subscribers will be subject to the price increase. </p>



<p>According to emails being sent out to Xbox Game Pass members within the European Union (EU) and other countries, the price increase from €18 to €27 will only be for new members and those who don’t have auto-renewal enabled.</p>

<p><strong>“Should you choose to cancel <span>your plan and repurchase, you will be charged the new current rate.

<p>After the emails went out, you’ve had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many take to Reddit</a> to confirm that they received the same message.</p>



<p>“Same with PC Gamepass in Germany, signed up for it when it was 9,99€, still paying 9,99€ after the increase to 11,99€ and got an email that the price will remain at 9,99€ instead of the new 14,99€ for me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="efb3244b720fe"><a title="Nintendo Store" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/efb3244b720fe/nintendo-store.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-announces-first-ever-pop-up-store-in-uk-opens-next-month">announcing its existence</a> last month, Nintendo has today opened ticket reservations for the UK's first Nintendo Store Pop-Up.</p>
<p>The store will appear on the ground floor of the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, and will be sticking around from <strong>22nd October - 16th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Those hoping to attend between the 22nd and the 26th will need to register for a free ticket via the <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">Nintendo Events website</a> (all those going from 27th onwards will not need to book in advance). The site is now live, with hour-long time slots available on all five opening days.</p>
<p>You'll need to be signed into a Nintendo Account to register for a free ticket, and if previous Pokémon Center pop-ups are anything to go by, we'd recommend getting in there fast.</p>

<p>The London pop-up will stock an extensive range of merch, including some exclusive pieces that are only available in the permanent stores in Japan.</p>
