            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A consumer rights watchdog in Brazil has launched a legal challenge against Nintendo for its policy of "bricking" the consoles of users who violate the console's terms of service. This policy is a new addition to Nintendo's user agreement. The change took effect on May 7, just a month before the Nintendo Switch 2 launched. Procon-SP, the São Paulo branch of the Brazilian Consumer Protection and Defense Program, has raised a complaint with Nintendo itself, claiming the policy violates consumer rights.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">IGN</a>, reports of "bricked" consoles have emerged since the Switch 2's launch. Affected users have speculated that bans result from the use of flash memory cards generally, and the MIG Switch device in particular, both of which can be used for piracy. A bricked console cannot access the internet and will display the error code 2124-4508. The ban encompasses paid online features like GameChat and online multiplayer, but also unpaid ones, like downloading patches or verifying Game-Key carts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, it is the console itself that is banned, not just the user account of the offender. This means that purchasing a Switch 2 secondhand could result in buying a "bricked" console, one that cannot access any of the console's online features. According to IGN, this has already happened. Nintendo has stated that such a ban is permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Procon-SP's statement</a>, Nintendo has agreed to respond to the claim within 20 days. The organization encourages Brazilian consumers to log their bans on the watchdog's official website while it waits on Nintendo's response.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, the company has responded to concerns that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-addresses-concerns-over-switch-2s-price-keeping-kids-from-getting-it/1100-6532994/">the console's price point would be a barrier to younger fans</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If, like me, you’ve noticed an uptick in anime girls with horse ears running around your social media timeline, you might be confused as to what the hell is going on. The game causing all this commotion, my friends, is <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>,<em> </em>a gacha game that has finally made its way to the West after originally launching in Japan back in 2021. The game is based on the titular media franchise in which racehorses are reincarnated as literal horse girls who do what racehorses do best, just as bipedal humans with horse ears on their heads. Given that there are dozens of horse girls in the series, the premise is ripe for a gacha game in which people gamble to unlock their favorite. But what do you do when you’ve got them? The same thing you’d do with a regular racehorse, of course: train them to be the very best.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like a lot of people, I had never heard of <em>Umamusume Pretty Derby </em>before the game’s launch in this part of the world last week. Despite its preposterous premise, the game plays its horse girl races pretty straight and with the kind of gusto and earnest determination you’d expect from any sports anime. As the girls run around the track, there’s spirited commentary, rivalries, and narratives unfolding. If I didn’t see that the girls had horse ears on their heads, I wouldn’t know it wasn’t just a straightforward racing show. Well, at least I wouldn’t until after the girls have crossed the finish line, at which point they put on an idol concert for a crowd of adoring fans. Sure, pop off, queens.</p><p>After <em>Umamusume </em>draws you in with all the glitz and glamour, it does what every one of these games does and bombards you with menus, currencies, and random drops. When I started to navigate these abundant, colorful menus, they crashed my iPhone 12. Maybe it’s time for an upgrade. Wait, is the horse girl gacha game going to get me to an AT&amp;T store to join modern times? What an odd turn of events.</p><p>Anyway, these random drops come in two forms: trainees and support cards. The former are the actual horse girls you’ll be training; the rest are supplementary cards that will give your primary character a boost. Each horse girl has a career that, once completed, allows them to be registered as a Veteran Umamusume and Legacy character, in order to grant stat boosts and other perks to other characters. So you can see how the grind feeds into itself and incentivizes you to train several racers rather than just your favorites. </p><p>When you get set up in your career, parts of the game feel more like playing with a digital pet than I expected. Each girl has different goals, requiring different training regimens to make progress in their story. You’ll also monitor their energy levels, interact with other students at the horse girl academy, and eventually, you’ll send her off to the races. The only real input you get into the competitions themselves is the training you put your horse girl through and the game plan you give her ahead of time. You can make some strategic decisions, like telling her to prioritize pacing herself instead of sprinting like her life depends on it, but the optimal strat is determined by the stats she’s gained through training ahead of races, Ultimately, your goal is to set her up for success; if you were hoping for a more direct racing game, you will not find that here.</p><p>All that being said, there’s potential here for some real sicko grinding and optimizing your racer’s stats, especially as you import legacy characters to boost those attributes and collect support cards through drops. It can make going through the careers feel almost like a rogue-like run in which you try to figure out the best build to claim victory. I see the various hooks <em>Umamusume </em>has lowered into the sea, and while I know the kind of people who gravitate towards these kinds of games might bite,&nbsp;I don’t know if the bait is quite to my liking, personally.&nbsp;I still find its barrage of mechanics and menus overwhelming, though, and there isn’t much else here pulling me in, so I don’t think I’ll be staring into the abyss long enough to get caught up in the gacha mechanics here. Gacha games are all about risk and reward, and I don’t think its wacky concept is enough reward for the risk of opening myself to gambling.</p><p>After spending a couple of hours with <em>Umamusume</em>, its bizarre premise seems to be the most compelling thing it has going for it. It’s got plenty of the drawbacks of other gacha games on the market: full of currencies that you can purchase for ungodly amounts of real-world money, rewards incentivizing you to log in every day, enough menus to overstimulate anyone who dares to install it, and character design so generic I couldn’t identify any of these girls in a line-up with a gun to my head. Lucky for it, the thing that makes it stand out is a memetic absurdist premise that helps it pierce through the oversaturated gacha market. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s just silly enough to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch the eye of those who aren’t usually paying attention</a></span>.

                <p>Twenty years ago at E3 2005, Sony showed off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-2-review/1900-6205274/" data-ref-id="1900-6205274">Killzone 2</a> video as an example of the PlayStation 3's power over its rival console, Microsoft's Xbox 360. However, Sony later admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-the-killzone/1100-6304486/" data-ref-id="1100-6304486">the Killzone 2 video wasn't actually gameplay footage</a> and that it was meant to be a "target render" for the team to achieve. Now, former Xbox boss Peter Moore has shared that he knew all along that the Killzone 2 demo was "BS."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-xbox-took-on-playstation-and?utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Moore recalled that Sony pulled a similar trick to outshine the Dreamcast when he worked for Sega. Sony essentially tried to adopt the strategy a second time to overshadow Xbox 360's launch.</p>

<p>"It was exactly the same tactics of creating a very expensive movie," said Moore. "But when the game came out, it was completely BS. I knew it that night when I watched it. I thought there's no way they're delivering this experience. They were doing the same thing to us as they did with Sega, which is go: 'Alright, cute little Xbox 360 coming out, but the big boys will be out with the PlayStation 3, so you should hang around and wait for that. Because look what we can do.'"</p><p>According to Moore, game journalists also recognized Sony's strategy and quickly came to the conclusion that the PS3 wasn't powerful enough to produce that level of detail in real-time.</p><p>Moore went on to describe Microsoft's strategic rollout of Xbox 360, and added that landing the console-exclusive rights for Call of Duty 2 went a long way towards the company's success.</p><p>In the present, Call of Duty remains the most-successful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">FPS</a> franchise, which is now owned by Microsoft after the Activision Blizzard sale.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>2K has announced the NBA 2K26 Standard Edition cover athlete as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the star guard of the NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder. The news caps off an incredible run for SGA, as he was not only a key part of the 2024-2025 NBA championship-winning Thunder but also league MVP, Finals MVP, and scoring champion.</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander joined the NBA in 2018, when he was drafted 11th overall by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded that same day to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he played for one year and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In July 2019, Gilgeous-Alexander was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he has played since. Since that trade, SGA has been named to three All-Star Teams and three All-NBA First Teams. The Toronto-born star also took home the 2023 Lionel Conacher Award, given to Canada’s male athlete of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a decade of back-and-forth attack and defense missions in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, it was most certainly time for an update. Most of us were probably expecting a sequel. But Ubisoft decided an update masquerading as an overhaul would suffice. <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em> enters the picture and, with it, a bunch of technical improvements, playable content, and promises. But if it’s been some time since you jumped into <em>Siege</em>, you’re likely curious about what makes this new version so special. Let’s get into it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h67630"><a id=""></a>What does the community think of the new update?</h2><p>Folks have been actively enjoying <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>since December of 2015. So we’re about a few months shy of 10 years—that’s a long time to settle into a routine. Folks have been playing maps, operators, and weapons with major changes introduced incrementally over the last decade. But with the <em>X</em> update, everything changes at once. Sometimes, it’s not for the better.</p><p>For instance, over on Steam,<strong> there are a slew of negative reviews, dropping the first-person shooter to ‘Mixed’ on the platform</strong>. To be fair, many of them denounce Ubisoft’s customer service, which is completely fair based on personal experience. Others, however, point toward the game’s ongoing toxic community as part of the problem. It’s not all bad, though. T<strong>here are still more positive reviews than negative, and players happily tout the gunplay and competitive edge that make up the core experience as continuing highlights.</strong></p><p>As for the critics, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/x-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/x-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PCGamesN</em></a></span> calls it a “remaster, not a reinvention” while showcasing the attention to detail throughout its reimagined environments, all of which change the dynamic between attackers and defenders.

But there’s a lot under the hood to consider, especially if you’re a returning player. It’s a little overwhelming, what with so many unique operators, weapon and character skins, game modes, and more to sift through. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Free Access</strong>: Anyone can download <em>Siege X</em> and gain access to Standard, Quick Play, and Dual Front, along with 26 Operators.</li><li><strong>Carrying Over</strong>: If you previously purchased <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and any of the content available, such as Operator packs, then everything carries over. <strong>You’ll retain your content, progression, access to Ranked matchmaking, and the Siege Cup, plus you’ll receive exclusive rewards.</strong></li><li><strong>Dual Front</strong>: One of the biggest (literally) additions to <em>Siege X</em> is the introduction of Dual Front, an all-new game mode that features the first-person shooter’s biggest map to date. You’ll secure territory while defending your current holdings in a 6v6 game mode.</li><li><strong>Destructible Elements</strong>: Fire extinguishers, metal detectors, gas pipes, and more litter the maps now, creating additional environmental destruction possibilities.</li><li><strong>Visual Overhaul</strong>: At launch, five maps received an entire graphical rework, and the team promises three more map reworks per season. Everything is graphically enhanced, from the ceilings to the floor tiles.</li><li><strong>New Animations</strong>: Alongside a visual overhaul, there are new animations. You may now inspect your weapon and rappelling now looks a bit more enticing and graphically better.</li></ul><h2 id="h67632"><a id=""></a>Which version should you purchase?<br></h2><p>There are three available editions for <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>. Most people will wind up playing the Free version, with its low barrier to entry. But if you genuinely enjoy the game and want more variety, the bigger, more expensive editions come with additional Operators.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Free</strong>: Unlocks Quick Match, Unranked, and Dual Front Modes, alongside 26 operators.</li><li><strong>Elite Edition</strong>: All of the above, plus competitive modes (Ranked and Siege Cup) and an additional 16 Operators.</li><li><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong>: All of the above, plus 52 additional Operators and 4 Operator cosmetic bundle packs.</li></ul><hr><p><br><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em> is available now, completely free-to-play, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rainbow-6-siege-tom-clancy-siege-x-update-still-good-1851785842]]></content:encoded>

And in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46603">Famitsu</a>, where he talks about anime and his love of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, he's particularly gushing about one recent Switch game that he thinks "anyone aspiring to become a game developer" should play.</p>
<p>That title is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and not for the in-game Echoes, summonable monsters, or even the puzzle design. Rather, it's how Nintendo has "used resources" and re-used assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="AnD-StQ8xqk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea7huztqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnD-StQ8xqk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1942432023127417087">Genki on X</a>, Yoshi-P says that he "was particularly impressed" with the top-down Zelda game, even compared to other recent games he's been playing.</p>
<p>"What I am about to talk about is a bit nerdy, but even from a producer's perspective there were many points [in the game] that made me think 'Wow, that's amazing', in terms of how they used resources, how they made it, and the game design."</p>
<p>"The base resources used in the game are almost the same as other Zelda games", the director continues, praising Nintendo's ability to keep costs down "by focusing all the efforts on making the game fun to play." Well, that last point is Nintendo to a tee.</p>

<p>But beyond that, Yoshi-P thinks that Echoes of Wisdom is a great case study for people wanting to get into game development; "I would encourage anyone aspiring to become a game developer or who is just starting their career to try playing this game from that perspective."</p>
<p>That's not the first time game developers have been wowed by a Zelda game — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>'s huge open world and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s incredible Ultrahand and Rewind mechanics had many in-awe back when those games launched. Zelda just has that magic, then.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see some of Yoshi-P's own work on the Switch 2; there have been hints and rumours that ports of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-final-fantasy-devs-supposedly-hint-at-another-nintendo-release">XVI may be on the cards</a> at some point, but nothing has been confirmed.</p>

Is it the note-taking to solve puzzles that appealed to you? Do you enjoy the freedom of exploring a space to get to the bottom of a mystery? Or have you just now realized that you really like roguelikes? Regardless of what you’re looking for, at least one of the five games listed here to help you scratch whatever itch the conclusion of <em>Blue Prince</em> has left you with. </p><p>—unless that itch is “I really want someone to recommend <em>Return to Obra Dinn</em> to me.” You’ll just have to let <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-of-the-obra-dinn-the-kotaku-review-1829797772">the official Kotaku review</a></span> do the talking since I never got to play it. Please send your complaints about this to TimHadNoMoneyIn2019@hotmail.com.</p><hr><h2 id="h96515"><a id=""></a>1: <em>Full Metal Furies</em></h2><p>Let’s kick off with a game that doesn’t appear as often on “games like <em>Blue Prince</em>” lists. And considering this is a co-op action game with no roguelike elements—despite coming from the people who gave us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rogue-legacy-2-is-definitely-more-rogue-legacy-so-far-1844779240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rogue-legacy-2-is-definitely-more-rogue-legacy-so-far-1844779240"><em>Rogue Legacy</em></a></span>—you might wonder what this game’s doing here!</p><p><strong>Without spoiling too much, all I can say is that anyone who loved taking tons of notes to solve puzzles in <em>Blue Prince</em> will <em>definitely</em> like <em>Full Metal Furies</em>.</strong> And trust me, you’re gonna need to think out of the box if you want to see this one to its true ending. If you’ve been enjoying <em>Blue Prince</em> with a friend, definitely link up to work your mind and reflexes to the fullest in <em>Full Metal Furies</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="h96516"><a id=""></a>2: <em>The Witness</em></h2><p>The surprisingly divisive puzzle adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626"><em>The Witness</em></a></span> is here for two reasons. For starters, it features an open world filled with line puzzles, and it’s up to you to figure out the rules to each of them. Sometimes these are straightforward, other times they can absolutely boggle your mind. Either way, it should appeal to those hungry for another puzzler after putting down <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p>The second reason is that <em>The Witness</em> actually has a full fan-made parody game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Looker</em></a></span>, which is tailored made for people who both love and hate Thekla, inc’s<em> </em>puzzler. This spoof is even on Steam for free, so you got no excuse not to check it out!</p><hr><h2 id="h96517"><a id=""></a>3: <em>Outer Wilds</em></h2><p>It might not be a roguelike, but <em>Outer Wilds</em> is one of the closest approximations you’ll find to the feel of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It’s a space exploration game that offers you enormous freedom as you dive deep into every corner of the solar system. Just like <em>Blue Prince</em>, the key here is to gather information as you piece together solutions to puzzles and the history of the civilization that came before you. You’ll even split your game time between “runs” of <em>Outer Wilds</em> just as each in-game day marks a new beginning in <em>Blue Prince</em>, even if the context is a bit different between the two.</p><p>I could say more, but fans of this one have made it very clear that the first rule of talking about <em>Outer Wilds</em> is that you don’t talk about <em>Outer Wilds </em>until all parties involved have finished it. So I recommend you play <em>Outer Wilds</em> to ensure that you can enjoy <em>Outer Wilds</em> related conversations in the future.</p><hr><h2 id="h96518"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Inscryption</em></h2><p>If <em>Blue Prince </em>was the moment you realized you like roguelikes, you should know that there are enough good games in the genre for you to play for, conservatively speaking, the next 8000 years. But if I had to pick just one to recommend, then know that you can’t go wrong with <em>Inscryption</em>.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Inscryption </em>isa card battler a la <em>Slay the Spire</em> and countless others. But as is the case with anything made by the guy who gave us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242"><em>Pony Island</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840"><em>Hex</em></a></span>, there’s something much more sinister (and metatextual) lurking beneath the surface. </p><p>You can actually find the creator of <em>Inscryption</em> endorsing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span> directly on the game’s Steam Page—he’s even listed in the Special Thanks section of the credits! Even if that’s a <em>very</em> tenuous connection between these two games, I’m sure <em>Blue Prince</em>’s creator would be very happy if you enjoyed the rich atmosphere of <em>Inscryption</em> too.</p><hr><h2 id="h96519"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Animal Well</em></h2><p>I’ve done my best to avoid the term “Metroidbrainia” so far, but <em>Animal Well</em> makes that task impossible. It’s a literal puzzle-focused Metroidvania that rewards out-of-the-box thinking, and you may even find yourself taking notes as you venture deeper into this game’s depths.</p><p><br>Where it gets especially <em>Blue Prince</em>-esque is in its layered design. Getting to the credits in <em>Animal Well</em> is a great accomplishment, but you’ll also see the signs leading you to dig deeper into the game’s secrets. And the more you peel away at each of the game’s layers, you’ll continue to find devious puzzles and new tools that will change the way you look at the sidescrolling world. <em>Animal Well</em> probably won’t occupy over a hundred hours of your time in the way Dogubomb’s game does. But if you’re eager for another rabbit hole to fall into, you’ll have a great time with this.  </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/games-like-blue-prince-roguelike-puzzle-inscryption-1851785833]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Naughty Dog has updated its remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201" data-mce-href="/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/">The Last of Us Part II</a> to feature an entirely new mode for fans to check out. Dubbed Chronological Mode, this new way to experience the game's story arranges the sprawling campaign into an organized timeline, allowing players to see it and its characters in a brand-new light.</p><p>A post to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> reads, "Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1942599934399701261?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Experience The Last of Us Part II in a whole new way with Chronological mode, a rearranged version of the game that lets you play the story in chronological order. 🕙<br>Available now with The Last of Us Part II Remastered via Patch v2.1.0 (PS5)*† and Patch v1.5 (PC)*.

The notion of experiencing both Ellie and Abby's final days in Seattle back to back with nothing to break up the onslaught of violence is already overwhelming.</p><p>Depending on who you ask, this move could be inspired or downright heretical. The Last of Us Part II was released back in 2020 to no shortage of acclaim <em>and </em>controversy over its story and non-linear structure. Infamously, a contingent of players at the time panned the decision to break from the perspective of Ellie, one of the franchises main characters, about halfway through the game in order to drop players into the shoes of Abby, an entirely new character that players had become familiar with as one of the sequel's villains. This change in perspective is also being applied to the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/">TV adaptation of The Last of Us</a> on HBO, whose upcoming third season will center Abby just like the second half of the sequel game.</p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the new update for The Last of Us Part II Remastered will feature new trophies and skins for players to unlock. The remaster, which was released just last year, also features a roguelike mode called No Return, where players can pick from among the game's cast and brawl through brutal, randomized encounters across the game's different backdrops.</p><p>With this latest update, Naughty Dog has added two new skins for players to pick from, and both are nods to Naughty Dog's other major franchise, Uncharted. As long as players complete the game's story in Chronological Mode, they should be able to unlock Joel dressed as Nathan Drake, as well as Joel's brother Tommy dressed as Nathan's brother, Sam, from Uncharted 4.</p><p>This update is available as of today on PS5 and PC.</p>

It's taken two forms: the excitement over successful games made by developers who draw deep from cultural or national influences, and the multi-pronged effort to reach new audiences in regions like South Korea, Brazil, China, Kenya, and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like Game Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Sandfall Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Shift Up's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have dominated professional discourse as successful versions of this phenomenon. There isn't any one way to capture the same lightning in a bottle that those three games did, but Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux has an interesting proposal for developers who want to branch out beyond their borders: consider developing "region-specific" versions of your games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Langourieux shared the idea with us in a conversation at DICE 2025, where we'd been discussing the outsourcing company's purchase of Umanaïa, Pipeworks, and Abstraction. There was obviously something self-serving about the pitch: his idea was that developers could tap into Virtuos' network of global studios to let local developers create variants of a game that would appeal to their friends and neighbors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does the idea have any merit beyond filling the coffers of Virtuos and competitors like Keywords or Pole To Win? Maybe—but only if developers can avoid pandering to players </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> not make compromises that favor authoritarian regimes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game studios have been making regional changes for decades">Game studios have been making regional changes for decades</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preparing different versions of games for different regions is anything but new. In 1989 developers like Dynamix prepared different versions of the PC game MechWarrior for MS-DOS in the United States and for the PC-98 and Sharp X68000. Just compare the two "mission completed" screenshots below:</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two versions have similar foundations—a profile picture of the pilot, relevant statistics, some flavor text, and a clan logo—but there are wide gaps in the UI and art direction between the two images.</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile in 2025, companies like Krafton have released regional variants of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pubg-corp-is-bringing-a-new-version-of-banned-i-pubg-mobile-i-to-india">places like India</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—sometimes after the original version of a game was banned by local governments. Localized versions of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/56203-the-chinese-version-of-maldraxxus-is-a-little-weird/">World of Warcraft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-switch/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions™ #FE</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might see (sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/sensitive/memes/vagina-bones">infamous</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) tweaks to character costumes or dialogue based on local cultural standards. And there've been times when developers experimented with story and characters changes with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">Nier Replicant</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">'s</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> international version </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nier Gestalt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our conversation, Langourieux's vision of "region-specific" game version went a little further than the more familiar approach those past examples represent.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Regional versions of games go beyond localization">Regional versions of games go beyond localization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you compare us to the movie industry, it's like we've not taken the good and we've kept the bad," Langourieux explained. He'd been in the middle of proclaiming that game developers needed to pursue shorter production timelines to match other entertainment businesses like film and television.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That industry is extremely agile and flexible with how movies are made...we can surely [create] more flexibility with how games are made, because we all know you need fewer people at the beginning of a game, a lot more in the middle, and fewer at the end."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you try to do that with a fixed team, you end up with waste or layoffs—usually both." He added that remote and distributed development driven by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it easier for teams to build flexibility (that is, if they don't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">implement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> strict </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">RTO policies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His appeal for agility and flexibility led to the discussion of regional game variants. "The bad thing about the movie industry is that...you can only make one movie that's the same movie for everybody. In games, we have the luxury to make different games for different people, and too few studios and publishers are fully leveraging that." He said he's seen more developers in Asia like Garena and Nexon take advantage of this practice than in the West.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first it sounded as though he was saying studios should operate like say, Asobo Studio, which makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Microsoft Flight Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the Plague Tale series. The two series target very different audiences. "My thought is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale: Innocence</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does not have to be the exact same game for people in the US, in Europe, or in Asia," Langourieux said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He quickly followed up that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might not be a great example here, and that he was mainly thinking of big budget live service games—but there are plenty of live service practices creeping back into the world of single-player offline games. You have the Early Access model which turns games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>9 Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Schedule I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into regularly updated games with new features. You have premium games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doing brand crossovers with series like Castlevania.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's hypothetically possible that with the right team, a developer could release content better catered to a local audience's needs.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have the growing PC install and mobile install base in newer economies like Southeast Asia and South America," he said. "And that creates opportunities to customize content in order to increase the likelihood of success of the game and earn overseas market share."</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't a risk-free proposition. Make a regional change without anyone from the area on the development team could lead to inadvertently offensive content or come off as pandering. And the question of how far developers are willing to go in regions where LGBTQ individuals, women, and ethnic minorities are restricted could create unexpected ethical quandaries similar to those we've already seen through regional changes to games in places where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamerant.com/spider-man-2-lgbtq-pride-flags-removed-saudi-arabia/">depictions of homosexuality</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are banned or restricted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Langourieux has a point. The flexibility of digital assets and downloadable updates means the game industry has more agency in globalization than other popular mediums. The main remaining question: can this practice benefit developers not chasing recurring revenue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">the live service business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Think of it more as an indie starter pack: a set of timeless stalwarts with immense replayability that remain perfect for diving into on any occasion.</p><p>While many of these games have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">filtered through <em>Kotaku</em>’s best Switch games list</a></span> over the years, it’s more of my own personal take on the canonical best all-around indie games to play either on the go, sitting by the pool, or late at night in bed. I hope it’s especially useful for anyone who has exhausted the Switch 2's initial launch lineup but wants a solid reason to keep playing their fancy new premium-feeling console. Wait until they’re on sale and you can also get almost all of them for the price of a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>The last 10 years have been great for mashups of old and new. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a></span> was one of the first to take the classic 2D exploration of a Metroidvania and infuse it with the punishing combat and memorable boss fights of a Soulslike.

It feels great, too, with the dodge and reload mechanics giving it a rewarding tactile quality you don’t always get in this type of arcade mashup.

It began life as an Xbox exclusive, which is why it didn’t get to Switch until 2019 where it runs surprisingly well. There’s a “simple mode” for anyone who gets stuck, and co-op using single Joy-Con. The<em> Delicious Last Course</em> DLC in 2022 added a new mini-adventure, boss fights, and a third playable character. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span> is one of the more recent Switch indie hits, coming in the second half of the console’s life.

The sequel is a timed console exclusive on Switch 1<em> </em>and 2 later this year. </p></div><div><p>Finally, a strategy game! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331?_gl=1*q11rpe*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5OTU2OTckbzI4JGcwJHQxNzUxOTk2NjE0JGo1NSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331?_gl=1*q11rpe*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5OTU2OTckbzI4JGcwJHQxNzUxOTk2NjE0JGo1NSRsMCRoMA.."><em>Into the Breach</em></a></span> is a grid-based roguelike that’s as much a puzzle game as a stripped-down <em>XCOM</em>-like. The rub is that every time you lose you can keep your surviving mech pilot and send them back in time to start a new run. It’s like <em>Front Mission</em> meets <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, where using the geography to your advantage is as important as the skills and weapons you outfit your squad with.

		<p>As of right about now you should be able to access every currently available expansion for Destiny 2, for free. As the base game is also free so that means you can play any campaign you have missed, plus the most recent three Episodes.</p>
<p>Bungie are clearly hoping to lure back players before the launch of The Edge of Fate, the start of a brand-new story within the game that will take players to the planetoid of Kepler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Launch Trailer [UK]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxfJCP21Qw8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Edge of Fate will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery,” say Bungie. “New enemies, weapons, gear, and destination-specific abilities await those brave enough to dive into its secrets.”</p>
<p>“A key feature of Kepler is the abundant dark matter energy, which powers the destination’s abilities. The new Matterspark ability allows Guardians to bind to dark matter to change forms, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces, jump and dash across terrain, and become a rolling force of destruction. Additional abilities include the new Relocator Cannon, which uses Fallen dark matter tech to teleport players across the environment, and Mattermorph, which lets Guardians manipulate their surroundings using the combined forces of dark matter and Strand.”</p>

<p>The launch of The Edge of Fate will also see a huge – and I mean huge – number of changes to the game itself.&nbsp; UI, armor, vendors, infusion, currencies, even your power level is changing as everyone will be reset back to what you started in Destiny. Yes, Destiny, not Destiny 2, you’re going back to power level 10.</p>
<p>There will also be a new Raid launching on July 19th and as usual there will be a contest mode to begin with which will be extra difficult and only for the most seasoned fireteams.</p>

<p>Sow much fun</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>When I reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> for Switch before its release, I said the newest entry was a "must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>
<p>Now, having played the game on Switch 2, I can safely say that Guardians of Azuma is still an inventive twist on a beloved series, but there are a few upgrades that make this killer entry in the Rune Factory series even more compelling on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182553 @ 1752010124 -->
<p>For anyone who already owns the game on Switch, you can purchase a $10 upgrade for Switch 2 that adds mouse functionality for easier building placement and improved graphics which includes a resolution bump and higher frame rate, which now aims for 60fps and largely stays consistent.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, I played the base version of the game on the newer console for a few hours, and it still felt like a slight improvement over playing it before, likely thanks to playing it on a better machine. The larger screen in particular made everything feel more cinematic. If you don’t feel like purchasing the upgrade separately, you’ll still have a great time with the game without it.</p>
<p>That being said, the Switch 2 Edition improvements to the experience are definitely noticeable. Everything is a bit sharper and faster, which I found particularly nice in busier combat situations and as my villages began to grow in size and complexity. And, while I didn’t personally have many distracting performance issues playing the game originally, it feels like it was made specifically for the more-powerful console. The upgrade takes what was already a thoughtful and beautiful gameplay experience to the next, pristine level.</p>
<p>The only mechanical difference is the new mouse functionality, which automatically kicks in when using the Joy-Con 2 mouse in build mode. When building your town, the mouse controls are undoubtedly helpful in creating interesting town designs, but it can be accessed using a regular controller as well. As a result, building is slightly faster, but I generally play in either handheld mode or docked mode with a controller and found removing the Joy-Con 2 just to build somewhat tedious. I’d call the mouse mode a cool addition but not necessary for a rich play experience.</p>
<p>On the whole, Guardians of Azuma is a stellar experience on any platform, with the Switch 2 offering that extra touch of greatness. Those who are particularly sensitive to performance issues will find themselves in safer hands with the upgrade, so long as you're willing to pay an upcharge for the privilege.</p></section></article><div><p>Jess is a writer and game designer based in Chicago.
