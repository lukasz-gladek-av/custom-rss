            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A new <em>Mario Kart</em> is usually built around some kind of notable feature. <em>Double Dash</em> added co-op play, while the DS iteration let you play other people online. With <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">it was gravity-defying tracks</a> and, later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">the idea of expanding the game through DLC courses</a>. With <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">perhaps the biggest launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there isn’t one single innovation that sets it apart. Instead, it’s the overwhelming chaos created by all the new features — and it’s a blast.</p></div><p>You can tell <em>World</em> is different right when you start a new race. Instead of beginning from a stopped position, your kart is already in motion before the race begins. That’s a small detail, though. What struck me when I played the game is just how much is going on. The tracks are larger, with wider roads and more alternate paths, and there are lots of moving pieces. Here’s a small sampling of the obstacles I faced during a few races: a road with towering giraffes and speeding ostriches getting mixed up with traffic; goombas that not only walked around but charged as soon as they saw me; koopa troopas that tossed things to knock me off course; and thwomps that would block the road but also fall over to create a temporary ramp.</p><p>There are also some new ways to navigate as you can now drive across water — and those waters are often choppy — and grind on certain rails like you were playing <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. I even saw some destructible elements, like guardrails that went flying when crashed into. Oh, and and races now include 24 drivers at a time. At one point, when I was close to taking the lead in a race, a pair of Bullet Bills whipped past me at the exact same time, sending me tumbling toward the back of the pack.</p><p>Perhaps the best example of this chaotic mindset is the new “knockout tour” mode, which is a bit like a <em>Mario Kart </em>take on battle royale. As you make your way through a course, you’ll come up against gated sections that only certain racers can get through. So, for example, the gate might only be accessible for those in 20th place or better, meaning all those trailing behind will get knocked out. The placement for subsequent gates will then increase throughout the race until there’s a winner, and it becomes a mad dash to stay on the track as long as possible.</p><p>There are also just a lot of neat, little details in <em>World</em>. Racers get squashed flat when run over, and you can spot tiny details like Mario’s poncho ruffling in the wind or Boo plugging his ears when a bomb detonates nearby. The rain, the water, the racers’ eclectic outfits — this is a really fun game to look at (which, of course, is extremely hard to do in the middle of a race).</p><p>Throw all of these elements together, and you get an experience that is filled with chaos and presents more opportunities than ever for exciting, emergent moments. That’s saying something considering how wild <em>Mario Kart</em> has been in the past. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and its Switch port are a tough, best-selling game to follow up, but <em>World</em> might end up topping it through sheer excess.</p><p><sub>Mario Kart World <em>launches alongside the Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Perhaps the most noticeable difference between the original Nintendo Switch and the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641598/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-cost-449-99">besides the more expensive price</a> — is the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Joy-Con controller</a> and its come-out-of-nowhere mouse functionality. I got the chance to demo them at a hands-on event, and damn are my shoulders and wrists <em>sore</em>. </p><p>There were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">several games</a> at the event that showed off the new mouse functionality, and I tried a couple of them, specifically <em>Drag x Drive</em> (pronounced drag <em>and</em> drive) and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Let’s start with <em>Drag x Drive</em>, the 3v3 wheelchair basketball game that essentially exists to show off the new Joy-Con mouse features. </p><p>But before I dive in: at the hands-on event, every game that showed off the mouse features was set up with a nice flat table, but the developers of the Switch 2 understand that most people don’t play console games with a handy table nearby and ready to go. From the hardware developer roundtable that took place at the event, I learned that you can use your lap as a surface, but not on bare skin — the controller also might have issues with certain fabrics, but at the very least, you gotta wear pants.</p><p>From the very first time I flipped a Joy-Con on its side, I knew using it as a mouse was going to be a problem. Holding a Joy-Con in the configuration required to use it as a mouse forces my hand to contort at an angle that is just off enough to feel awkward. To get at the buttons, my fingers can’t lay in a flat, neutral position like they would on a mouse. They have to curl, forcing my wrist to pivot up in an unnatural position.</p><p>It’s not immediately painful, but after moving my arms up and down across the table to mimic powering a wheelchair, I could feel tension shooting up my wrist all the way to my shoulder. After the short demo session, in which I practiced moving the chair and passing and shooting the ball, my right arm burned with an unpleasant sting, and I don’t have a history of carpel tunnel syndrome or other pains of the wrist and shoulder. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> was a better experience in terms of how the Joy-Con mouse felt in my hand, but worse in terms of function. For the demo, I held the two Joy-Cons in each hand, and I could choose to use my right hand as either a mouse or hold it normally. I will say that it was neat that I could seamlessly transition between mouse mode and regular mode with the twist of my wrist — the game automatically sensed which way I was holding the controller and responded accordingly. But <em>neither </em>felt good to use. The right hand controlled Samus’ aiming and shooting, and in both modes, I missed 90 percent of her shots because it was so hard to aim precisely. </p><div><p>I don’t know how some of y’all played the previous<em> Metroid Prime</em> titles, first-person action adventure games, with a Wiimote, and this felt like the Wii’s “waggle physics” — a term that describes the Wii’s imprecise and ofttimes janky motion controlling — resurrected from the dead. I know I would have enjoyed the demo way more if I had the option to play with a regular-ass controller.</p><p>Mouse functionality is one of the biggest differentiators between the OG Switch and the Switch 2: Electric Boogaloo, but I simply don’t care for it. There’s nothing I saw at the hands-on event that really demonstrated the use case for this feature. It’s awkward, the novelty it introduces does not improve gameplay, and frankly, it <em>hurts </em>to use. I hope that there are more games coming, like <em>Civilization VII</em>, for which the mouse functionality actually makes sense, that’ll convince me this is cool. But for now, I don’t see it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s time for the latest game announcements for April 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Every week new games are announced or major updates come for previously announced titles. Sometimes, it happens at such a pace that it’s impossible for the average player to keep up with the latest details. </p>



<p>The last week has been one of those weeks. And no matter how big or small, we want to make sure you know about the latest game reveals, updates, and release date announcements. Oh, and if you notice a lot of Nintendo games, that’s for good reason as the company had not one, but two directs over the last week.</p>

                <p>In the span of two years, Jack Black has starred in three video game movies: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/" data-ref-id="1900-6418051">The Super Mario Bros.

Ahead of the premiere of his latest video game film, Black revealed that he's been an avid player of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a> on mobile.

He also noted that he uses his iPhone to play the game, but he's only unlocked the first deck while trying to obtain the blue deck. Black went on to express some frustration about the way the game deals with chance.</p><p>"It just makes me mad that so much of it seems to be luck," said Black. "No matter how good you are at it, you've got to get those... certain unlockable cards." Then Black looked at the camera and added, "Maybe you can give me some tips."</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">Balatro joined Game Pass</a> in late February, perhaps players there can help Black by posting advice for him online. Before coming to Game Pass, Balatro was one of last year's breakout indie hits, and it was even named one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>.</p><p>Black's next film, A Minecraft Movie, opens in theaters on April 4. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">GameSpot's review of the movie</a> called it "exactly what you think it is, for better or worse." </p>

            <p>A new teaser trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows Josh Hutcherson's security guard Mike back following the ordeals of the first film. It also gives us a look at Balloon Boy (who popped up in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> post-credits scene).</p>
<p>"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances," the trailer blurb reads, promising viewers a "blood-chilling new chapter of animatronic terror". You can check out the new trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 below.</p>

<p>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is set for release on 5th December, because nothing says festive fun like a massive animatronic bear trying to do you in.</p>
<p>Last year, Hutcherson - who has also starred in The Hunger Games - said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-is-much-bigger-and-scarier-than-its-predecessor">second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said in October. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there."</p>
<p>Along with Hutcherson, returning cast members include Matthew Lillard, Piper Rubio and Elizabeth Lail. Meanwhile, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by returning filmmaker Emma Tammi, with Jason Blum - known also for the likes of M3GAN and the Halloween series - to produce alongside the game series' Scott Cawthon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">upcoming sequel was announced in April last year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/brief-thoughts-on-every-switch-2-game-i-played/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>On Wednesday, while Austin, Cado, Rob, and Ren played board games in front of cameras, I was a few blocks down the street playing Switch 2 games all day. It was, as many of you figured out, the reason why we decided to host an in-person stream during the week (not ideal!). But the appeal of getting together during such a momentous event in the games industry, which just happened to also be taking place in New York, seemed like too much of an opportunity to ultimately pass on.</p><p>You’ll hear many in-depth thoughts on Remap Radio, which we’re recording live as this is article/email/who can say is going live, but I’m left to my own thoughts in my hotel, so I thought I’d share a few.</p><p>Please excuse any typos!</p><p>First, I have to set the scene. When you walked in, everyone cheered for you. Like, full-on applause. <em>Clapping</em>. The event took place at the same location where in a few days time, Nintendo fans will walk through the same place and play the same games. It felt like a dress rehearsal for the folks hired to run the event, but it was tremendously funny and weird to be cheered after a few minor events, like:</p><ul><li>Going to the bathroom</li><li>Eating lunch</li><li>Checking to see if I could line up an interview</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, I enjoyed the applause.&nbsp;I deserved it.</p><p>The lineup was a mixture of existing games coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time (ports, ports, ports), updates to Switch 1 games that will cost an unknown amount, and brand-new games from Nintendo. Because these demos are also going to be played by the public in the coming weeks, this wasn’t a situation where I was given an opportunity to poke at these games for an hour. Instead, it was between 10 and 20 (often exhilarating, sometimes puzzling) minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, I love Nintendo games. I’ll take 10 to 20 strange minutes, you know? So, a few brief thoughts on everything I played on a Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="donkey-kong-bananza"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>What a wild and zany guy!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Really fun, loud, and weird. A surprising mashup of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, with the player getting dumped into large-ish areas with both main and side “quests” to explore, the ability to climb up anything and everything, and Donkey Kong pulling a <em>Red Faction</em> and being able to smash through nearly every object in front or below him. It has a very chaotic feeling, and was the only game whose demo I went back to multiple times, because it was always clear when the screen went to black and cut me off that I’d hardly seen everything there was to do.</p><p>This comes out in July, but really, <em>this</em> is my Switch 2 launch game.</p><hr><h2 id="mario-kart-world"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>There's a dedicated "wave at people" button in the open world.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need another <em>Mario Kart</em> in my life? No. Yes? Apparently. It’s hardly a graphical tour de force and my first moments with the game felt disquietingly familiar…but folks, Knockmode Tour, a race mode where players are booted if they don’t place at checkpoints, is <em>thrilling</em>. I was hooting and hollering within minutes, especially as I heard people groaning in defeat. The races feel long and <em>sweaty</em>. You never know when to use an item. It’s chaos at checkpoints, as 20+ players dump every power-up into the world in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.</p><p>I cannot fathom what it must feel like to lose in the opening act, because I simply did not. At least, until I did. </p><p>Alas.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Mario Kart game seems to whip ass. The open world is TBD, however.</p><hr><h2 id="super-mario-party-jamboree"><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>This will be much better after a few beers.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate how much I liked this, because it only reinforces how much of a mark I am for hardware gimmicks. It’s unclear how long Nintendo will fully and faithfully incorporate video support into their games, or if it ends up going the way of HD Rumble, but <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>makes good and goofy use of players jumping in front of a microphone. Plus, it’s one of the better demonstrations of the “mouse” support—much more so than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, oddly?</p><hr><h2 id="metroid-prime-4-beyond"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I'm such a sucker for these slower first-person-shooters.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gorgeous. Nintendo talking about “performance modes”? My love language. They were not showing the game in 4K/60 but instead, 1080/120. It looked incredible, a showcase in how good art <em>immediately</em> looks great when dropped into higher resolutions and frame rates. This will prove a trend with Switch 2, I think.</p><p>Nintendo was pushing the game’s “mouse” support, though I was not required to use it. Swapping control methods was as simple as placing the Joy-con face down or picking it up and holding it normally. Seamless. But in the spirit of experimentation, I stuck with playing using the Switch 2's version of a mouse through the demo, which concluded in deeply familiar <em>Metroid Prime</em> fashion, as you circled a boss while locked on. (This is, to be very clear, a compliment.)&nbsp;</p><p>This is the most “cinematic” <em>Metroid Prime</em> yet, which could go either way?</p><p>It feels like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. It looks like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. But I was not able to really explore, nor use any of the psychic powers. The mouse controls absolutely worked but felt odd in a game where, by design, you’re locking on to objects in the environment to scan and attack. You cannot dash in <em>Metroid Prime </em>without first locking on; it’s not possible in free aim.&nbsp;Yet <em>whatever</em>, I can’t wait to play more.</p><hr><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR1_HYENDFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CYBERPUNK 2077 arrivo su Switch 2 trailer NINTENDO DIRECT ITALIANO"></iframe></figure><p>A fine version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at a frame rate that, to my Not Digital Foundry Eyes, seemed like 30 frames per second. Very playable. No real notes, other than to wonder whether porting older games will have the same draw on the Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="breath-of-the-wildtears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-edition"><strong>Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Pretty! C'mon!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Truth be told, I did not play these—I watched other people. It felt like I could glean everything noteworthy by watching someone else pick up the controller and gawking at the visuals. It makes me feel better about my decision to put <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> down in the midst of a boss battle, convincing myself it was because Nintendo, inevitably, would release an upgraded version. Maybe, maybe not? Who can say? But this looks awesome, and I am so glad Nintendo finally added the ability to share creations within the game. It should've been there on day one.</p><hr><h2 id="dragxdrive"><strong>DragxDrive</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Extremely cool to see video game characters featured in a wheelchair.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Exhausting, but in a good way?</p><p>It was the first time—but not the last—Nintendo emphasized you don’t need a table to use the mouse controls. Instead, you can place the Joy-cons on your pants and go to town. It works shockingly well, but then I became distracted wondering how much time, energy, and pairs of pants Nintendo had torn through before they could so confidently talk about this. Again, the pants thing came up <em>multiple</em> times.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of playing games, I watched the Nintendo Direct at the same time you did on a large video screen with a couple hundred people in the audience. Everyone was dead silent when this game was revealed, but I can tell you that actually playing it, despite how complicated navigating the controls can be, is pretty fun!</p><p>I think this one will find an audience once people actually play it.</p><hr><h2 id="kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition"><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Once video feature I had was Project K.I.R.B.Y. where we'd play every Kirby game and lean all the lore.</span></figcaption></figure><p>What a good looking <em>game</em>. </p><p>This is what I mean by Nintendo’s art immediately looking spectacular on better hardware. This is a game that I have at home, and yet I spent 20 minutes of my time playing Nintendo’s next-generation hardware because it looked that good. I’m not sure there’s a higher compliment you can really pay than that, and that’s without knowing what Nintendo’s even gonna charge me for upgrading this one.</p><hr><h2 id="switch-2-welcome-tour"><strong>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Neat! Make it free!</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is not <em>Wii Sports</em> or <em>Nintendoland</em>, and yet, I’m still trying to figure out why Nintendo is charging for this. It's possible the fee is nominal, but knowing that Nintendo is charging $80 for <em>Mario Kart</em>, can you say that with <em>any</em> guarantee?</p><p>And yet, this was profoundly charming. I cackled at having to try and guess a ball bouncing across the screen at different frame rates. It was fun to play a version of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that stretched far, far, far, <em>far</em> across the screen to demonstrate how 4K works. I played a variation of <em>FantaVision</em> that helped me better understand the implementation of HDR. (I still think HDR is overstated.)</p><p>This feels meatier than a tech demo, and yet…it should probably just be a bundle. There is <em>so</em> much love here, why not go the extra mile in sparking the imagination of a kid inspired to play this, wanting to know what’s inside their favorite device?</p><hr><p>I was, truth be told, left wanting more. Okay, yes, I want to see the next Mario. I’m selfish. It’s unclear to me if the current Switch 2 lineup demands showing up on day one, even if all the games I played that will only be on Switch 2 are <em>very</em> likely to make credible arguments for being in a list of my favorite games of the year. </p><p>Great games? Almost certainly.&nbsp;</p><p>Revolutionary games? We’ll have to see.&nbsp;</p><p>An unfair burden, but one Nintendo's earned, and I intend to hold them to it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong is one versatile monkey. He's gone from one of the most infamous video game villains to a hero of his own platformer series, a rhythm game star, and more. His one attempt at a 3D platformer, Donkey Kong 64, was a bit of a low point in his storied career, but you can't keep a good ape down, and now he's back with another swing at the genre. After some hands-on time with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> game, I think Donkey Kong Bananza may just be his 3D platformer redemption.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza carries some noticeable DNA from another Nintendo game, but its central hook is all its own. The general feel and flow of movement around the world feels very similar to Super Mario Odyssey, but whereas Mario is a fleet-footed little plumber, Donkey Kong is known for being a brutish bruiser. He hits hard, and in this case, that means a playground of destructible environments to smack your way through.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="379878773" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

DK's powerful punches can clear out a huge swath of cave wall or ground, so it's easy to just charge in a direction while quickly burrowing through obstacles. After a while you start to learn some finesse, especially when it comes to the controls. The directions of the face buttons generally correspond to which direction you smack--B for a downward, digging-like slam; Y for a forward punch; and X for an upward strike. You can start pummeling with intention, clearing away caves in the direction you mean to.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also things that can't be punched through--specifically metal floors and walls, which serve to guide you in the right direction. Still, in the way that any child naturally loves to dig up dirt, thwacking your way through the soil just strikes a primal part of your brain. It's fun to clear a room, and DK is just the ape to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">The environments are bright and vibrant, and the rock and soil terraform nicely with a satisfying crunchy feeling. Still, if any one aspect makes Donkey Kong Bananza a visual showpiece for the Switch 2, it's DK himself. Both the titular character and the monkeys and baddies he meets are rendered as adorably squat cartoon characters that squash and stretch with expressiveness. Donkey Kong has never looked better in video game form, and his look here bears an incredible resemblance to his appearance in the animated Mario movie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the context of the story, the metal floors and walls are there because this version of DK happens to be in some kind of monkey-world mining operation, where all of the monkeys happily labor away looking for gems shaped like giant bananas inside the earth's crust. Why a monkey would particularly want a banana that they cannot eat, I have no idea. Stop asking questions. A disaster befalls the mining operation and DK's adventure begins in earnest. He also for some reason loses his pants. That he ever <em>had</em> pants implies that this world recognizes nudity, but the other apes politely seem to ignore it.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point the digging through dirt gets a bit more direction, both figuratively and literally, as you burrow your way through stages and start to deal with enemies. You can sometimes punch them, but other times you need to grab a piece of explosive rock and hurl it in their direction. What happens when you hurl explosive rock in the direction of destructible environments, you may ask? Now you're thinking like a true destruction connoisseur.</p><p dir="ltr">This segment of the demo took place in a watery stage, and while there wasn't a clearly defined objective marker, all of the momentum and visual markers led upwards. So DK was largely making his way up a hilly slope, dispatching enemies along the way, to reach the story objective at the top. But DK semi-regularly discovered crystal bananas hiding in the rock, similar to how Mario finds power moons littered throughout the open-world stages of Mario Odyssey. The bananas even look similar to the moons, visually.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a platforming game in Donkey Kong Bananza, buried somewhere deep inside the recesses and soil and rock. From the small taste I played, I can tell that there will be objectives and crystal bananas and enemies to dispatch and directions to go and probably more than a few boss fights. The relatively small number of each of those that I saw in the demo seemed very fun. But Donkey Kong Bananza more than anything is a toy that lets you dig through solid rock and dirt as a super-strong monkey, and that's just the purest form of childlike fun.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On: Facing 18 Years Of Expectations</a></li></ul>

The game was announced at E3 2017 before being delayed and rebooted and delayed again, but even at the time of that reveal, it had been a decade since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption released. At one time it seemed like a game doomed by its own sky-high expectations. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon, Beyond is finally real, and playable, and great. It's too early to say if it can rise above almost two decades of anticipation, but having now played it, I don't think it will be a victim of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is now part of the cross-generational push, representing both a swan song for the original Switch and a launch-window game for Switch 2. I only played the Switch 2 version, so I can't speak to differences in performance between the platforms--but it already appears to make for a very nice Switch 2 showpiece.</p><div tabindex="0"

and modernizing it to a new platform. Yes, Samus' face reflects in her visor when you fire a shot close to a wall, but this time she squints slightly in the direction of the light. Retro Studios is clearly exercising great care for stewarding this franchise, even down to the little touches.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo starts with a cinematic that echoes how the industry has matured over the last few decades. While Samus would often land her ship on an alien planet and begin exploring without much preamble, this game begins with a massive battle scene reminiscent of a blockbuster. Samus weaves through Federation ships, lending support and narrowly avoiding disaster, showcasing her skills as a crack pilot in addition to a bounty hunter. You get the sense that she's the Federation's most trusted ally for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">What followed from there was an early-game tutorial, teaching the basics of shooting, scanning, using the morph ball and bombs, and so on. It was punctuated by cinematic moments and battles, but this was clearly aimed at teaching me the ropes. And I'm glad, because Metroid Prime 4 introduces a new approach to control schemes that will take some getting used to.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii already experimented with using the Wii remote as a cursor, functionality that was echoed by one of the options in the recent Metroid Prime Remastered. Metroid Prime 4 adds the Switch 2's mouse functionality to emulate first-person aiming on PC. You may expect that this would necessitate a menu in which you pick a control scheme, but Prime 4 takes a novel approach: What if you just had access to all the control schemes, all the time, and could switch between them on demand?</p><p dir="ltr">It's complex without feeling complicated. When exploring the world you'll mostly rely on the traditional dual-stick control scheme. When you lock-on to an enemy, your Joy-Con automatically converts to the gyro pointer mode like Prime Trilogy or Remastered. And most impressively, at any point you can simply put your Joy-Con controller down on a surface and it instantly converts to mouse mode, letting you control it that way. No menu selection or toggle required. It's a heck of a trick.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to a general pattern of traditional controls for exploring and then using the pointer control to fire at legions of alien bugs. At the end of the demo, a boss creature was infected by a Metroid, leading it to develop Metroid-like pustules all over its body. Being a lifelong gamer I immediately recognized these as weak points, but I wasn't quite getting the precision I wanted from the pointer functionality, so I put the Joy-Con down and swapped to mouse controls. It all just worked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297"></a><figcaption>Aiming down sights on a hostile alien planet in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The switching did feel awkward sometimes. I would forget that I'm using a cursor and miss a shot, for example. But I'm not too proud to admit this seemed like a skill issue, and developing a rhythm of switching between the control schemes as the situation dictates feels like it would come with time, not in the compressed conditions of a press demo.</p><p dir="ltr">The only concern I have, and it's a minor one, is that this very limited slice of the game seemed notably more action-oriented than Metroid Prime tends to be. I suspect this is simply because I was playing the beginning of the game, and the tutorial, which is engineered to both excite the player and also teach all the combat-related mechanics in a short period of time. But Metroid Prime has always been at its best when it felt serenely eerie and lonely. A massive battle full of explosions and Federation soldiers is neither. I hope after this initial burst of action the game settles into a more recognizable form.</p><p dir="ltr">And I expect that of Metroid Prime 4, because Retro Studios seems to understand what makes this series so special in the hearts of Metroid fans. The expanded control options are an important part of removing the barriers between you and Samus, to feel like you're the one behind the visor. The extremely long wait may not have led to a revolutionary overhaul, but it does feel like coming home--even if that home is a strange alien planet.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li></ul>

In a break from recent tradition, Nintendo showcased only few unique hardware advancements and instead focused on a field it's been historically reluctant to dive into: online multiplayer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mysterious "C" button, it turned out, wasn't some button that unlocked magical hardware capabilities, but instead quickly brings players into a feature called "GameChat." GameChat appears to be a slimmed-down version of social platforms like Discord that acts as an all-in-one hub for group multiplayer, video calls, private game streaming, and more, all run through the Nintendo Switch 2.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the company that rolled out a mobile app to support voice chat on Nintendo Switch has gone all-in on a console-based micro social network.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why would the normally multiplayer-shy Nintendo dive deep into online multiplayer this way? Well in a world where players are asking developers "can I play with my friends?", the company seems to have picked up on a growing game industry trend: a future where players—especially younger ones—want to play together at all times.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo thinks it can finally make &quot;safe&quot; online spaces">Nintendo thinks it can finally make "safe" online spaces</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a follow-up presentation at a media event held during the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser seemed to tip the company's hand as to why it seems to have finally committed resources to robust online features. He spoke of how players of all ages can now "safely connect" and play games with friends and family.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Safety" has been the watchword for Nintendo's hesitance to jump feet-first into online play.

"So we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces.

Adding in the expansion pack? $50 a year. The most they charge for online play is $80 a year for a full family plan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those prices are low compared to subscription plans on Xbox and PlayStation, but up until this point its offerings were relatively light. A robust suite of social tools is more likely to convince a bunch of dedicated Switch users to make the jump.</span></p><p>Image via System Era Softworks/Devolver Digital.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Switch 2 also now has a clear hardware feature that sets ahead of other handhelds. To set up comparable multiplayer services on say, an ROG Ally, players need to download an app like Discord and calibrate it to fit with their playstyle before they can chat with friends. With the Nintendo Switch 2, players can start talking with the push of a button.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then there's the mysterious but ever-present concept of "brand loyalty." Nintendo isn't short on loyal players, but its scaled-back social systems have created an exit vector for players to leave its ecosystem. Now, in a very Apple-like fashion, Nintendo can support voice chat and screen sharing without pushing users to another service (and with the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, it can also eliminate the need to buy non-Nintendo hardware).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The runaway success of the Nintendo Switch certainly raised expectations for the Switch 2's sales performance. While the multiplayer tools themselves may not propel the system to over 150 million units sold in its lifetime (Switch 2 exclusive </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Duskbloods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might do a lot of heavy lifting), it sets the table for more monetization opportunities down the line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However the Switch 2 performs, its multiplayer-centric hardware shows Nintendo is keeping an eye on changing trends. Multiplayer has long been a domain into which Nintendo barely treads, so its choice to go all-in on the technology—especially in lieu of drastically new physical hardware features—signals the weight of its strategic shift.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> has topped a BAFTA poll to find the most influential video game of all time.</p>
<p>The 1999 Dreamcast release may have struggled commercially at launch, but it has provided the blueprint for open world games ever since, received a cult following, and was followed by two sequels.</p>
<p>It's perhaps a surprise choice for the public-voted poll, with creator Yu Suzuki stating he was "deeply honoured and grateful" for Shenmue's win. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, 'How real can a game become?', aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail," he said. "This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement."</p>

<p>The top five games in the poll are all classics worthy of the title. Following Shenmue are Doom, Super Mario Bros, Half-Life, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> (my own personal choice).</p>

<p>But there's one outlier in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. Whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">it's a good or bad game is one thing</a>, but can a game released just two months ago in February 2025 really be considered that influential, especially when compared to others in the list?</p>
<p>"We made Doom to push boundaries and ignite imaginations, and it’s amazing to see its legacy still resonating over 30 years later," said Doom co-creator John Romero. "Doom's lasting impact is also thanks to the incredible community that embraced it, modded it, speedran it, and kept it alive across generations - this recognition is a tribute to them as much as the game itself."</p>
<p>"We're honored to hear that players felt that both Half-Life 1 and 2 should be included in the list of influential video games," said Valve. "When we set out to make them, like all developers, we had big dreams. Like what if the game didn't immediately crash your computer upon load? So, unsurprisingly, the legacy of these games was the last thing on our minds when we were in the thick of development. For the Half-Life games to become both meaningful to players and foundational to our medium is, frankly, humbling. We can only hope that everyone who has enjoyed them over the years has as much fun with our future efforts."</p>
<p>Shenmue fans will surely be happy to see the game recognised, especially after the news last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-gets-new-publisher-sparking-multiplatform-hope">Shenmue 3 has a new publisher</a>, sparking hopes of a multiplatform release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">Fans even rented a Times Square billboard to campaign for a fourth game</a>.</p>
<p>Last year BAFTA ran a similar poll ahead of its BAFTA Games Awards, with Lara Croft voted the most iconic video game character.</p>
<p>The top 20 most influential video games of all time in the BAFTA poll are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shenmue</li>
<li>Doom</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Half-Life</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
<li>Super Mario 64</li>
<li>Half-Life 2</li>
<li>The Sims</li>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Tomb Raider</li>
<li>Pong</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
<li>World of Warcraft</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
<li>Dark Souls</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 3</li>
<li>Skyrim</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's BAFTA Game Awards will take place next week on Tuesday 8th April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 has the most nominations</a>, but Best Game will be a tussle between Black Myth: Wukong, Helldivers 2, Thank Goodness You're Here!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Astro Bot, and Balatro.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, this also begs the question: how quickly will a Switch 2's internal storage fill up?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-supports-120fps-up-to-4k-resolution-docked">Switch 2's 256GB internal storage</a> is a big step up from the original Switch’s 32GB. However, early signs already suggest Switch 2 games will be much larger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, like we've mentioned, is a 64GB download. By comparison, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16GB. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-nintendo-switch-games-are-getting-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-metroid-prime-4">Switch 2 version</a>—and other titles like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">$80 Mario Kart World</a>—will likely demand significantly more space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious solution?

But unlike the original Switch, which accepted standard microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 is locked to microSD Express</a>. That means your old microSD cards won’t work, and more importantly, you’ll need to buy new, notably pricier memory cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, IGN’s deals team has already tracked down the best prices on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards</a>, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp5EV?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB</a> ($44.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewqoJ?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB </a>($59.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXGRE?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512GB</a> ($99.99), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp55W?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1TB versions</a> ($199.99) options from SanDisk and Lexar. However, some are already being snapped up in bulk and are now listed as "temporarily out of stock" on Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is also partnering with SanDisk and Samsung to release its own branded cards, though if history is any indication, expect them to be more expensive than identical third-party versions. It’s also possible more manufacturers will jump into the microSD Express market now that the Switch 2 is driving demand, but whether that leads to lower prices remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Switch 2, you can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">everything from the Nintendo Direct right here</a>, and read our full guide on how to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">secure your preorder for the Switch 2</a> on April 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Editor, Commerce, for IGN.

            <p>Judging by reactions online across the world, the cost of the Switch 2 and its software has proven to be controversial. Perhaps Nintendo knew this, considering it didn't include the price in the actual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the console will cost £395.99, or £429.99 bundled with Mario Kart World, when it launches on 5th June. That's compared to the £280 launch price of the original Switch, and £310 launch price of the OLED.</p>
<p>It's the increase in the cost of games themselves, though, that's proven most shocking. Mario Kart World, for instance, will cost £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally. That's an increase from £49.99 for most brand new original Switch games.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananaza, meanwhile, is slightly cheaper: £66.99 for a physical copy and £58.99 digital. There's the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour game too, which will cost 990 yen <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/index.html">according to the Japanese website</a> - that's around a fiver.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">some Switch 2 physical game cards won't actually include the full game</a>, but include a download key instead. As for the difference between physical and digital pricing, this appears to be a shift towards pushing digital games - especially with the addition of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">sharable Virtual Game Cards Nintendo revealed last week</a>.</p>
<p>Still, accounting for inflation, the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>To directly compare the consoles alone, £280 for the original Switch works out at £367.40 today with inflation, still cheaper than Switch 2. However, throw in the big launch game and it's a better deal - an original Switch with a separate copy of Breath of the Wild cost £340 at launch in 2017, which works out at £446.13. That's pricier than the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle.</p>
<p>Over in Europe, the Switch 2 console costs €469.99, or €509.99 for the Mario Kart World bundle. That's equivalent to the cost in the UK.</p>
<p>It's a different story in other parts of the world, however.</p>
<p>In Japan, for instance, Nintendo will be selling a region-locked console at a lower price, in a bid to stop importers due to the weak yen.</p>
<p>The Japan-only console will cost 49980 yen (around £258.95), but will only play Japanese games in Japanese language, with a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>A more expensive Switch 2 with multilingual support will also be available at 69980 yen, around £362.57. That's still slightly cheaper than in the UK, though doesn't account for import costs.</p>
<p>As for the price of Mario Kart World in Japan, it'll be 9980 yen compared to the cost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> on the original Switch at 6578 yen. As Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, wrote on social media, that's 52 percent more expensive, which is a higher jump than the 33 percent rise from $60 to $80 in the US.</p>

<p>As for the console itself in the US, it costs $450, but there are fears this could rise to as much as $600 if impacted by new tariffs from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Tariffs - taxes charged on products when they enter the country - could be as much as 46 percent on products from Vietnam, which is where the majority of Switch 2 manufacturing has taken place, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">Kotaku</a> has reported.</p>
<p>David Gibson, analyst at MST Financial, confirmed to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de">The FT</a>: "Export data combined with finished product codes confirms that Nintendo shipped finished Switch 2 [from Vietnam] across five days in January for a total of 383,000 units with all of them going to the USA."</p>
<p>He added: "I suspect this occurred to test the distribution system and get ahead of the risk of tariffs. I expect the numbers to have ramped-up significantly in February and March."</p>
<p>Wrote Niko Partners director of research and insights <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907545230699610327">Daniel Ahmad on social media</a>: "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway."</p>
<p>Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">continued in a blog post</a>: "The higher cost of the console in the US compared to Japan is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions. Japan accounted for nearly 25 percent of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain momentum.</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect. That being said, we think it's unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next 5 years."</p>
<p>Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis also suggested to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">IGN</a> Nintendo "probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs", which is why the price wasn't included in the Direct.</p>
<p>However, analysts don't believe the pricing will impact sales of Switch 2 initially.</p>
<p>"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Circana analyst Mat Piscatella told IGN. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p>
<p>"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p>
<p>And compared with Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> at £699.99 and Valve's Steam Deck OLED at £479.00, the price of Nintendo's new console still appears reasonable.</p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on whether consumers are able to pre-order, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own Nintendo store in a bid to reduce scalping. That's based on playtime and the requirement of a Nintendo Online account.</p>
<p>In the meantime, multiple online UK retailers have already gone live and sold out of Switch 2 stock, without the need to meet Nintendo's criteria.</p>
