<p>Marvel Rivals has announced a new, limited-time game mode, Clone Rumble, which will launch on March 7, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble is a new game mode where players must rely on strategy, teamwork and ‘controlled chaos’. Each team will be allowed to select one Hero, and the remaining players must choose between these two. The battlefield will become an “ultimate mirror showdown”, where players will find clones of the same Hero battling each other across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble, players will have to adapt to survive. They need to coordinate with team members using the same Hero to bolster their strength and figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing Hero. Everyone on the map will use the same Hero and abilities, so efficiency and tactical movements will be key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1896953790915391788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> for Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble provides us with a glimpse of all the chaos that awaits us on March 7. The video starts with a row of 6 Mr. Fantastics marching around the map before they clash with a group of another 6 Reed Richards. We also see a swarm of Punishers wreaking absolute destruction across the map, with turrets popping up in every nook and corner.&nbsp;A new Black Widow skin will also be introduced, called Widow of Timely. It can be claimed through Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. </p>

                <p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio has announced that it has delayed the PS5 and Xbox releases of Fragpunk due to technical difficulties, though the PC version will still launch tomorrow, March 6. A new release date for the console versions has not been revealed.</p><p>"During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaption," the team said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>

<p>As consolation, players will receive all rewards gained through engagement from the start of Season 1 until the console versions go live. These include in-game currency, cosmetics, and experience.</p><p>As a result of the delay, the studio has to cancel and refund all preorders on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S due to their platform policies. Those who've already preorder will also receive $10 worth of in-game currency when the console versions launch.</p><p>There are also no longer any preorder bonuses for the console versions either, but the bundle will be available in a limited-time capacity when they're released.</p><p>Fragpunk is a free-to-play new hero shooter that utilizes a card system with various abilities. The card selection changes every round and can be mixed and matched to create some wild combinations. For example, there are cards that can increase your jump height, engulf your bullets in flame, and resurrect your allies.</p><p>Bad Guitar Studio is also a subsidiary of NetEase, which has been mired in controversy lately. NetEase is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">reportedly trying to sell off its non-Chinese studio</a> but the company claims it's still committed to its overseas studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s dominance over the latest generation of graphics cards ends today. AMD might have surrendered the high end of the GPU market, but its new $549 Radeon RX 9070 and $599 RX 9070 XT look set to bring Nvidia back to reality, at least in the midrange. </p><p>After a disappointing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">$549 RTX 5070</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/posts/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-a-cheaper-rtx-4080/1022046466451493/">$749 RTX 5070 Ti</a> that’s near impossible to buy for anything less than $899, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">$1,999 RTX 5090</a> whose only competition is other Nvidia cards, AMD’s next-gen GPUs look perfectly timed and deliver on performance and price. </p><p>The RX 9070 is around 17 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5070 in 4K without upscaling enabled, cruising past Nvidia’s card for the same price. The RX 9070 XT is as fast as the RTX 5070 Ti for $150 less.</p><p>Pricing is key with these cards, particularly as <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q324-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-decreased-14-5-from-last-quarter/">only 10 percent</a> of GPU sales right now are from AMD. The company needs a big win with its latest generation of cards if it wants to regain ground from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 series might be just what the GPU market needs.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->549</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>16GB of VRAM</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->598</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>The $599 price tag</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>I wish it had a little more VRAM</li><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="hardware"><h2>Hardware</h2></p></div><p>AMD hasn’t created reference cards for the RX 9070 series, so the end result is designs from add-in board partners that look very similar to the ones used for previous generations of Radeon GPUs. The Gigabyte RX 9070 I’ve been testing is longer and bulkier than the RTX 5070.</p><p>The XFX 9070 XT I’ve been testing is also a 3.5-slot card, so it takes up far more space in a case than the two-slot RTX 5080 or 5090 Founders Edition or even the 2.5-slot RTX 5070 Ti card I reviewed. I far prefer the reference designs AMD has used in the past, and the RX 9070-series cards are big and bulky in comparison. AMD has also stuck to using two 8-pin PCIe power connectors with the RX 9070 series, instead of switching to 12VHPWR. It does mean you’ll need to run two PCIe connectors to both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, but you won’t need to worry about PSU compatibility or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">risk of a 12VHPWR connector melting</a>.</p><p>Both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship with 16GB of VRAM, which is a good amount at these prices. Nvidia only has 12GB of VRAM on its $549 RTX 5070, so you’re certainly getting more value from a $549 RX 9070 here — especially if you’re looking at 4K gaming where VRAM demands are higher.</p><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2><strong>1440p and 4K benchmarks</strong></h2></p></div><div><div><p id="test-machine"><h2>Test machine:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU cooler:</strong> Corsair H150i Elite LCD</span></li><li><span><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte Aorus Master</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</span></li><li><span><strong>PSU: </strong>Corsair HX1000W</span></li><li><span><strong>Case: </strong>Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</span></li></ul></div></div><p>I’ve been testing AMD’s RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP. I’ve put the RX 9070 and 9070 XT up against Nvidia’s RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti as well as its existing RX 7900 XT and XTX GPUs. </p><p>I’ve tested a variety of games at both 1440p and 4K, including more demanding titles like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and benchmarking favorites like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. All games have been tested at very high or ultra settings, and I enabled ray tracing in some titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em> to see what AMD’s latest GPUs can deliver there.</p><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p. It’s 17 percent faster at 4K and nearly 20 percent faster at 1440p. It’s not even close. In some games, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the RX 9070 is more than 30 percent faster, with or without FSR enabled.</p><p>The $599 RX 9070 XT competes with Nvidia’s $749 RTX 5070 Ti, with an average frame rate difference of less than 1 percent without upscaling across the nine games we tested. The differences between these two cards really come down to the individual games, with the RX 9070 XT less than 5 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti in titles like <em>Returnal </em>and <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em>.</p><div><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p</p></div><p>The RX 9070 XT isn’t that far behind AMD’s previous flagship, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">$999 RX 7900 XTX</a>, either. I found the XTX was less than 2 percent faster at 4K and 1440p tests without upscaling enabled. That’s a small performance gap, considering the price differences between these cards.</p><p>I think the RX 9070 makes the most sense at 1440p, and the RX 9070 XT is definitely worth the extra $50 if you want to move to 4K gaming. Considering the small price gap, it’s worth paying the extra $50 for better 1440p performance, too. </p><div><p id="fsr-4-and-rdna-4"><h2><strong>FSR 4 and RDNA 4</strong></h2></p></div><p>AMD’s 9000-series GPUs are built on top of the company’s RDNA 4 architecture, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. This new architecture also includes improvements to boost ray-tracing performance.</p><p>In <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em> with ultra ray tracing enabled, the RX 9070 XT is nearly 7 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s 4 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti. Nvidia still reigns supreme in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at 4K with ray tracing and upscaling enabled, though, with the RTX 5070 Ti 16 percent ahead of the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>The RDNA 4 architecture also includes a new version of AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling, which now uses dedicated AI accelerator hardware to improve frame rates and image quality — much like Nvidia’s DLSS. FSR 4 is exclusive to these new RX 9070 graphics cards, and it works in all games that have FSR 3.1 integrated. All you have to do is flick a switch in the AMD software, and FSR 4 will be enabled automatically in supported games.</p><p>With FSR 4, AMD hasn’t followed Nvidia with Multi Frame Generation, instead focusing on improving image quality in upscaled games. I tested FSR 4 in both <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The FSR 4 changes are more obvious in </em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, the advances are immediately obvious. The current FSR 3.1 implementation often results in a more soft or blurry image, which is especially noticeable in text on walls or objects that are slightly further away. FSR 4 makes the overall image look a lot sharper and, in some cases, even better than the native 4K output. A police car has a blurry numberplate and logo in FSR 3.1 quality mode. But in FSR 4 quality, it’s upscaled correctly, and the entire car looks a lot sharper as a result. Details on buildings are also more clear, and even enemies look more detailed in motion with FSR 4. And this all comes without a noticeable performance hit, which is great. </p><p>The FSR 4 improvements are less obvious in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and I struggled to notice any difference between FSR 3.1 quality and FSR 4 quality modes. While this might suggest your mileage may vary with FSR 4 quality, I was able to use ultra performance FSR 4 and get surprisingly good visual quality and higher frame rates from the game.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You have to look really closely at rocks to notice FSR 4 improvements in </em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Beyond gaming, the RX 9070 cards are both a lot more capable for AI workloads. In Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, the RX 9070 XT is more than 40 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s around 20 percent behind the AI performance of the RTX 5070. The RX 9070 is also more than 40 percent faster in the AI XL test over the RX 7900 XT, but the RTX 5070 is nearly 40 percent faster in this AI workload test.</p><p>I normally test video editing capabilities with PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve benchmark, but it gets around 20 percent into the test and crashes on AMD’s GPUs.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s great to see AMD lower power supply requirements and power draw on its latest Radeon GPUs. AMD recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RX 9070 XT, for its 304 watts of total board power. I’ve found it delivers performance close to the RX 7900 XTX while using 40 watts less power at 4K. The 9070 XT averaged at 303 watts during my tests, while the 7900 XTX averaged 346 watts.</p><p>It’s the same story for the RX 9070. AMD recommends a 650-watt power supply for this card, 100 watts less than the 750-watt recommendation for the 7900 XT. In my tests, the RX 9070 averaged 244 watts, while the 7900 XT averaged more than 25 percent more power draw at 307 watts. That’s a big efficiency improvement, and it’s only 34 more watts of power draw than the RTX 5070 for a noticeable performance gap between these two $549 cards.</p><p>The RX 9070 also hit a maximum temperature of 60 degrees Celsius in my open testbench, compared to 70C for the RX 7900 XT. The RX 9070 XT reached just 55C in my testing, compared to 71C for the RX 7900 XTX. Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Founders Edition card reached 77C in the same tests, with MSI’s Ventus 3 RTX 5070 Ti reaching 68C. </p><p>AMD’s latest generation of Radeon GPUs are more efficient and run cooler than its previous generation, and they also run cooler than Nvidia’s direct competitors. That’s a clear win for AMD.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s new GPUs are big and bulky compared to Nvidia’s sleek Founders Edition cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>AMD has priced its RX 9070-series cards really aggressively, particularly with the $599 RX 9070 XT being $150 cheaper than the RTX 5070 Ti. The $549 RX 9070 is the same price as Nvidia’s RTX 5070, but it beats the 5070 in every game I’ve tested, sometimes by a big margin.</p><p>If AMD manages to have these cards in stock at these prices, then it’s going to shake up the important midrange of the GPU market.</p><p>The question is whether it can chip away at Nvidia’s dominance. In addition to (or because of) its 90 percent market share, Nvidia also has an advantage in how many more games support DLSS than FSR. And DLSS is so popular that 80 percent of RTX owners <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344212/nvidias-dlss-is-surprisingly-popular">activate it in games</a>. FSR 4 improves image quality to compete more closely with DLSS, but AMD still needs game developers to implement it. Nvidia lets you simply force DLSS 4 in games, so you don’t need to wait on developers at all.</p><p>The stickiness of DLSS could tempt PC gamers to spend a little more to stay with Nvidia, and I haven’t seen enough from FSR 4 yet to know whether it can compete with the upscaling improvements Nvidia made with DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are also an advantage; the company works with developers to optimize drivers for games before they launch, whereas AMD has long had driver issues with a variety of games. I haven’t run into any issues while testing the RX 9070 series, but I can’t promise that will be the case when new games are released. While AMD says it has been working hard on improving its drivers, only time will tell.</p><p>Either way, AMD’s RX 9070-series cards are a clear indication that it’s not giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia. It’s willing to compete on performance and price, and that’s a winning formula if AMD manages to keep those prices under control.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This can be done at the glowing Adra stones scattered about the game world, usually within a circle of dirt. Once you place your Camp, there’s a Workbench off to one side that looks more like a small storage tent, complete with a few crates and a small table, where you can spend resources to upgrade the level and stats of most weapons and armor pieces in the game. These levels are:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Common (Green)</strong></li><li><strong>Fine (Blue)</strong></li><li><strong>Exceptional (Purple)</strong></li><li><strong>Superb (Red)</strong></li><li><strong>Legendary (Yellow)</strong></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You click on the weapon in the list, and if it’s lit up white, it means it can be upgraded. In the middle of the screen, you’ll see its stats right now and the stats it’ll reach if you upgrade. Select it, agree to upgrade, and ta-da, it’s now more powerful!</p><p>There’s a catch, however. You can’t upgrade any old weapon you pick up off the ground and expect to walk away with a legendary or unique piece. It doesn’t quite work that way. For all common weapons and armor pieces, the max level is Superb Quality +3, which increases most of the item’s stats by a significant amount. In some cases, you’ll receive an item with over +100 additional damage, so it’s still good! However, if you find a unique weapon, you can upgrade it to Legendary. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566">You’ll require Adra</a></span>, which you can acquire via gold chests, Strangled Adra, and Merchants.</p><figure id="" data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h561217"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get upgrade materials</strong></h2><p>You have a few options regarding acquiring the necessary upgrade materials in Avowed to keep you fighting toe-to-toe with any of the game’s enemies.

<p>The first Battlefield Labs playtest will start this week, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Battlefield Labs will have its first playtest to test “concepts and mechanics” on Friday March 7th. The playtest will be the first in EA’s new Battlefield Labs program, which was announced earlier this year. The first test is scheduled to take place for approximately two hours on the PC.</p>



<p>According to the email sent to participants, the test is in a “closed test environment” and recording, streaming, and and discussions about the game are strictly prohibited. But whether participants stick to such a confidentiality agreement remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Players can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still sign up to the Battlefield Labs</a> in order to try and gain access to future Battlefield playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is said to be EA’s “most ambitious community development collaboration ever, where a select number of fans will step inside the war room.”</p>



<p>Its announcement saw hundreds of thousands of people sign up, with EA assuring players that no matter when you register, you’ll still be as equally eligible to be accepted as those who registered first.</p>



<p>The playtest comes as DICE and EA want to work more closely with the community after Battlefield 2042’s fumbled launch, which was poorly received by the community.</p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is scheduled to release later this year on the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>The release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has seemingly been confirmed by one of the game’s voice actors. </p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, voice actor Khary Payton said that the current plan for the game’s launch is around Christmas time this year.</p>



<p>“We’re still working,” the Black Panther voice actor said. “We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I’m so excited.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>A Christmas 2025 release is the most definitive information regarding the game that fans have gotten in some time. The game was first revealed during GDC 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-revealed-along-with-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its name and first trailer</a> shown. Since then, however, it’s been quiet on all fronts as the game’s development continues.</p>



<p>Set in occupied Paris during World War II, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is based on the 2010 limited series comic Captain America / Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers. The story follows an alliance between Black Panther and Captain America as they work to prevent Hydra from coming into power. The game will allow players to control one of four main protagonists throughout, including Captain America Steve Rogers, Azzuri (Black Panther), the leader of the Wakandan Spy Network Nanali, and Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones.</p>



<p>Neither developer Skydance New Media nor publisher Plaion have commented officially on the game’s release date. Should the Christmas 2025 window be confirmed, it’s likely to happen sometime in the next few months as more gaming events such as Game Developers Conference 2025 and Summer Games Fest 2025 take place.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">This isn't a mistake or a typo. Sony has released a new update for the PS3--not the PS4 or PS5--that "improves system performance." While that description is especially vague, it's possible the patch relates to renewing the Blu-ray player encryption key for the home console.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1897200775819862327?s=46" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the Ask PlayStation account announced the new PS3 update and pointed players to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">the PlayStation website</a>. Sony says 200MB must be available on the system's hard drive to download version 4.92. The company also then writes in bold about the Blu-ray player encryption key renewal to continue playing discs. The last console patch occurred just over a year ago on February 27, 2024, for version 4.91.</p><p dir="ltr">PS3 launched in Japan and North America in November 2006, followed by a European release in March 2007. Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-3-announced-for-2006/1100-6124681/">unveiled the PS3 at E3 in May 2006</a>, showcasing titles like Metal Gear Solid 4 and Devil May Cry 4 at the event. That means the Sony system will turn 19 years old later this year. In 2012, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-unveils-new-ps3-model/1100-6396730/">redesigned PS3 was released</a>, and ultimately, Sony sold over 87 million units of the home console.</p><p dir="ltr">Just yesterday, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celebrate-the-ps2s-25th-anniversary-with-these-pictures-from-launch-day/1100-6529850/">PS2 celebrated its 25th anniversary</a>, as a Redditor shared photos of traveling to Japan to buy the system. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-is-out-now-but-it-doesnt-really-do-much/1100-6528979/">PS5 received a stability update</a> in January that didn't really do much. That month also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-classic-anniversary-themes-are-leaving-but-wont-be-gone-forever/1100-6529148/" data-ref-id="1100-6529148">saw the removal of the 30th-anniversary PS5 themes</a>, though Sony mentioned they could return in the future.</p>

            <p>
WiFi Wars, a live comedy game show spin-off from telly programme Go 8 Bit, is soon coming to a venue that's probably quite near you. 
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Go 8 Bit's Steve McNeil, the interactive show uses clever tech to let the audience play along via mini-games, challenges and quizzes streamed to their smartphones.
</p>
<p>
The format was previously part of the Royal Institution's Summer Programme and the BBC Christmas Lectures, and has also popped up at the equally-eclectic venues of the Edinburgh Fringe and EGX. Intrigued? There's a video with more of what it's all about just below.

<p>
If you fancy popping along, there's a two-week run coming up in London over Easter, sandwiched between dates in March, April and June elsewhere in the UK. The tour is set to visit Bolton, Bristol, Norwich, Wrexham, Mchynlleth, Aylesbury, Cambridge and more. Also, both Southampton and Northampton.
</p>
<p>
The full list of dates are over on the <a href="https://www.wifiwars.co.uk/dates/">WiFi Wars website</a>, and tickets go for around £16 depending on location - in the country, and within the venue of your seat.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daves-video-game-tv-show-dara-o-briains-go-8-bit-canned-after-three-series">Go 8 Bit finished up a three-season run on comedy channel Dave back in 2018</a>. Hosted by Dara O Briain, it featured a selection of celebs battling through rounds of video game-based challenges to various levels of success. Famous faces on the show included Jonathan Ross, Sonia from Eastenders, and the wonderful Ellie Gibson - formerly of this website, and now a successful standup comedian and podcaster.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-for-rtx-5070-and-fragpunk-which-has-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for the launch of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12-gb-graphics-card-launched-will-549-msrp-models-be-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card</a>. The driver is also optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fragpunk-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-its-in-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a>. The latter game, a fast-paced 5v5 hero shooter from developer Bad Guitar Studio, will take advantage of the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, when it launches launch tomorrow. The game also supports ray tracing effects.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can deliver an average 4.6x performance boost at 4K with all settings maxed out. On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the game can reportedly run at almost 500 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode with the newest transformer model. I would wager anyone should rather choose DLAA to get better image quality instead. Also, enabling NVIDIA Reflex can reduce your system's latency by up to 60%, which could make all the difference between life and death in a competitive multiplayer shooter like FragPunk.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Tomorrow, Nacon and Eko Software will also launch the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished in early access, with day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Dragonkin: The Banished is expected to stay in early access for seven to ten months.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two games launched with varying levels of NVIDIA RTX technology support. The first one is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</a>, which supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex, with Frame Generation slated to be added later. The other game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678820/Vector_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Strike</a>, a free-to-play hybrid of sports game and first-person shooter based on fast-paced, physics-based action. In the title developed by Chamo Games, players face each other in a 4v4 arena. NVIDIA RTX users can enable DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Recently, Valve also introduced support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex (which can improve latency by up to 45% in this instance) in its upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadlock</a>, currently in testing with a selected number of users. The third-person 6v6 MOBA still doesn't have a release date.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Koei Tecmo's PC port of Rise of the Ronin (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched last year on consoles</a>) will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation when it debuts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-march-11th-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 11</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a system software update for the PS3 almost nine years after the seventh-generation console was discontinued in the US.</p>

<p>Of course, the update is a pretty <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">small</a> one; it doesn't add any major new features to the console, nor does it fix any obvious, glaring issues. Instead, much like the two updates before it, it simply "improves system performance", which usually involves smaller under-the-hood changes.</p>

<p>According to Sony, you're going to need 200MB of free space on your PS3 if you want to download this update. You can either update your system software through the console itself or via PC using a USB drive or other removable storage media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=5H4eFQdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=Pa7-dXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS3 has received a new system update almost nine years after its discontinuation.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking to play Blu-ray discs on your PS3, you'll need to update, as Sony says you'll need a renewed encryption key to play the discs. You can get that key by - you guessed it - updating your console.</p>

<p>The PS3 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-3-production-ending-soon" rel="nofollow">discontinued back in 2017</a>, which means it was supported by Sony for around eleven years. That's not a bad innings for a console, and it's roughly the same time period for which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-discontinues-production-of-xbox-360" rel="nofollow">Microsoft supported the Xbox 360</a>.</p>

<p>Sony released the console in late 2006, and while it went on to achieve the lowest hardware sales of its respective generation, it was up against the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii, so that's hardly a surprise.</p>

<p>Iconic franchises like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series got their start on the PS3, and many of its games have been remade or remastered for subsequent generations.</p>




<p>The PS3 was also the first console to feature a Blu-ray disc drive; Xbox instead opted for the doomed HD DVD format, although that decision would be reversed in time for the launch of the Xbox One in 2013.</p>

<p>In 2021, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-on-ps3-consoles-closes-this-july" rel="nofollow">announced it would shut down the PlayStation Store</a> across PS3 and its two handhelds, but widespread backlash saw the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-will-stay-online-for-ps3-and-vita" rel="nofollow">reverse that decision swiftly</a>, at least in the case of the PS3 and the PS Vita.</p>

<p>Sadly, this PS3 update almost certainly doesn't herald some kind of phoenix-like revival for the console, but hey - if you're still playing your PS3, at least you know it hasn't been totally forgotten. Stay tuned for more.</p>

As far as damage goes, The Thing is equipped with melee moves, meaning you need to be close to your opponent to do any damage. These include “Rocky Jab” which lets The Thing throw two consecutive punches, and “Stone Haymaker” which has him throw a massive strike after a quick charge.</p><figure id="" data-id="f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-recommend-id="image://f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-recommend-id="image://f008b74b298d483a0688b351e1873ae2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Thing's main screen, Ben surrounded by icons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of damage, The Thing has several movement abilities, including “Yancy Street Charge.” This allows the rocky fellow to rush forward, tossing enemies in his path up in the air, and ending with the creation of a zone that prevents enemy mobility moves. He also can use “Embattled Leap” to jump to any nearby allies, granting them and him a buff to reduce incoming damage. And of course, he wouldn’t be the Thing without his signature catchphrase, so his Ultimate Ability is “Clobberin’ Time,” which launches all enemies in front of him up into the air.</p><h2 id="h1521562"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play The Thing?</strong></h2><p>The Thing is a pretty straightforward tank. His attacks are limited to close-range, meaning you should always be at the forefront of your team while staying wary of ranged characters. You should be using his movement abilities to disrupt the enemy team, either by using Yancy Street Charge to tear through them while your allies take advantage of the confusion to get picks, or by using Embattled Leap, to jump to a teammate and turn a 1v1 into a 2v1 while also providing a defensive buff reducing the odds of them getting knocked out. As an added bonus, if things start looking bad for old Ben, you can use Leap to get into your backline to recover.</p><p>The Thing is one of the easiest to play Tanks in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and while his lack of ranged abilities can put him in some tricky situations, his big range of movement options allows him plenty of ways to turn the tide of any skirmishes. Now, get out there and make Aunt Petunia even more proud of her favorite nephew.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russo-brothers-say-they-are-open-to-developing-games-ties-to-their-avengers-movies.1125831/</guid>

<p>In a new interview, the Russo brothers have said that they are open to developing video games tied to their Avengers movies.</p>



<p>The interview comes courtesy of <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, where the Russo brothers were pushing their latest project “The Electric State.”</p>



<p>In the interview, it was said that the Russos helped Netflix develop a mobile game based on Electric State with their media company AGBO and will be expanding with recent hire of Nifty Games vet&nbsp;Pete Wanat&nbsp;as president of interactive technology.</p>



<p>It was said that the company now plans to produce three large-scale transmedia projects based on original ideas, but are open to developing games tied to their upcoming Avengers films. This includes Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars.</p>



<p>“We would definitely be open to it,” said Joe Russo. </p>



<p>“Right now, what we’re doing is creating new IP. At AGBO, we want to tell new stories. We want to tell new stories with new characters and new worlds that people haven’t seen before. So Anthony and I and Donald are working together to build out new worlds. And we have three that we’re currently working on that the intention is, for every world we build to have the scale and depth of a “Star Wars” universe, but in a different genre. And then we’ll build materials around those new worlds. We’ll tell stories in different ways using different media in those worlds,” he continue.</p>



<p>So although it might be a ways off, the Russo’s are definitely open to having a games tied to the Avengers games and its upcoming movies.</p>



<p>Would you like to see an Avengers Doomsday or Secret Wars video game? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Here are some of the best games we’ve played so far in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Fight a giant pink baboon that tries to kill you with its farts. Bob and weave on the back of a bird-like raptor as you track a majestic dragon across a desert during a booming thunderstorm. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>offers these experiences and more in a tightly wound, streamlined package that’s lavishly presented and fun as hell to play. Yes, the inventory is a mess. No, the story won’t win any awards. There’s still decades of franchise design baggage to occasionally grapple with, but it’s all in service of some of the most entertaining emergent battles ever produced in a video game, powered by an elegant but deep combat system that never misses a beat. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>is a heartfelt, narrative-focused social sim with rhythm elements that puts you in the shoes of Rama, a musician who recently lost his partner and essentially went into hiding for a year. As he tries to reintegrate into his social circle and band, <em>Afterlove EP </em>focuses on the mundane and ugly parts of grief and how it can distort us into unlikable versions of ourselves. Repairing yourself after you’ve gone through something painful isn’t glamorous, it’s just work. <em>Afterlove EP </em>takes you through one month of Rama’s life as he tries to figure out his shit when his entire world has been shattered. That work takes longer than mere weeks, but at least through your decisions, you can give Rama a good head start. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Don’t Nod’s return to supernatural young adult drama is off to an excellent start. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>’s first half blends the deceptive allure of ‘90s nostalgia with an unsettling modern-day mystery, and the result is one of the studio’s most tantalizing stories since <em>Life Is Strange 2</em> in 2019. Through its awkward but likable heroine Swann, <em>Lost Records</em> illustrates the hardships of growing up sensitive, shy, and unsure of yourself. The connections between its cast of four young women are raw and earnest, and it makes the mystery of what could have happened to these friends that would cause them to go decades without speaking all the more compelling. I can’t wait to see where it goes when episode two launches in April. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Hazelight’s third go at its signature cooperative adventure format is its best one yet. <em>Split Fiction</em> blends video game and narrative genres into a constant dopamine drip that never seems to run out of ideas. Its many fantasy and sci-fi worlds are pretty derivative, but Hazelight manages to design so many clever puzzles and mechanics within them that the game’s takes on those ideas still feel fresh. As generic as those levels are, <em>Split Fiction </em>gives them meaning by insisting on the importance of the human element of storytelling and art, which makes fighting through those stages to save them from corporate clutches all the more satisfying. It also has one of the most mind-blowing final stretches I’ve played in recent memory. What a game. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The discourse around <em>Avowed</em>’s release was fascinating. It felt like a process of elimination, the wider gaming public trying to work out what Obsidian’s RPG <em>wasn’t</em>, before it could figure out what it actually is. It’s not like <em>Skyrim</em>, as some had tried to say it would be, and it’s not like a BioWare RPG either, with 100+ hours of intricate questing. It’s also not like <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, the isometric traditional cRPGs from Obsidian in whose universe it takes place. But when this all eventually settled, the result was something an awful lot of people realized was exactly what they wanted: a manageable first-person RPG with a rich story, great characters, and chunky combat, that “only” asks for 30 to 40 hours of your life.</p><p>By stripping back various elements from the genre, and creating a more focused interpretation of a usually more sprawling format, Obsidian was able to give great emphasis to the excellent combat, making a game that felt enormous and still offered huge amounts of side-questing and exploration, but also maintained a clip that propelled you toward its narrative conclusion. It’s also just tremendously fun, and despite the plague-ridden setting, maintains an upbeat feel that matches its colorful design. A splash of happiness is just what we need. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>series is like a chameleon that somehow always finds a way to play with different genres and storylines. <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em>takes the crime soap opera series and turns it into a swashbuckling pirate adventure, and commits to the bit so hard that it actually works. Fan-favorite antihero Goro Majima takes on the starring role for the first time, and he’s the perfect frontman for the series to lean into an implausible premise with. But while this game sees the series charting wacky new narrative territory accompanied by new ship battles and other pirate-y accoutrements, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>still has plenty of the beat-em-up action and endearingly silly social antics fans have come to know and love. How much longer can RGG Studio keep shifting genres while still feeling true to the series’ roots? With <em>Pirate Yakuza</em>,<em> </em>they clearly haven’t jumped the shark yet. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Part cyberpunk RPG, part gig economy sim,<em> Citizen Sleeper 2 </em>expands on the incredible first game with a much more expansive world, more characters, new systems, and tons more fantastic writing. It cleverly weaves together disparate tales of corporate oppression, fallen empires, and interstellar communities using the power of dice rolls and skill checks. The result is a winning formula that fuses top-tier video game storytelling with engrossing tabletop mechanics. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Soulslike metroidvanias are a dime a dozen, but few are as good as <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>. It takes place across a sprawling 2D kingdom full of automatons that have become corrupted by a mysterious blight. You fight them to gain their powers and then use those to win even bigger, more spectacular boss fights. The story is more of a moodboard than a fully-fleshed out tale, which works perfectly to give the proceedings a compellingly grim fantasy flavor without ever weighing down the combat and exploration, which is where <em>Bloom in the Mist</em> really excels. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is so back. <em>Origins</em> isn’t everything I want the historical hack-and-slash series to be but it’s a perfect foundation for the game on modern platforms. It cleverly melds the possibilities enabled by new tech with the tried-and-true arcade formula of being a one-fighter, army-stomping machine. Combat is excellent with new parry mechanics, and an overhead map section gives the connective tissue in between battles a massive upgrade. There’s never been a better time to pursue Lu Bu. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Keep Driving</em>—a 2D pixel art RPG about going on a long road trip in the ‘90s—offers the thrill of a road trip without breaking the bank or using up all your vacation time. In<em> Keep Driving</em>, you’ll have to manage your car, your hunger, and your sleep, keep going in the right direction, and deal with hazards like traffic jams and deer. Pull it off and you’ll reach your destination, a music festival, before the end of summer. Of course, like any good road trip, detours might lead you to something unexpected… - Zack Zwiezen<br></p></div><div><p>An RPG doesn’t need to be bigger than <em>Skyrim </em>to be good, and <em>Eternal Strands </em>gets this. Instead of offering a massive sandbox, this third-person physics-focused fantasy RPG provides exciting combat and smaller, more detailed zones to explore. Get ready to climb big monsters and chuck small creatures off of cliffs in this colorful indie RPG. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Not only is <em>Slender Threads</em> a splendid point-and-click adventure game, with top-notch art and voice acting as well as great puzzles, but it’s also the most extraordinary meta-exploration of the form, yet without any of that tedious knowing winking that often plagues games committed to such commentary.</p><p>Harvey Green is a wannabe writer and door-to-door book salesman, living in an ambiguous era, having just arrived in an anonymous small American town. Things are…eerie here, but it’s not until you solve a fairly standard bizarro point-and-click puzzle—dressing up a mannequin to put into a busy road crossing to try to distract a policeman—that the real nature of <em>Slender Threads</em> begins to reveal itself. And no, I shall not spoil it here. Let’s just say it explores the notion of the amoral central character.</p><p>It’s also, crucially, a really good adventure game at the same time. A really fantastic find. — John Walker</p></div><div><p>I’m scared to look at how many hours I’ve put into <em>Two Point Museum</em>, the latest entry in the wacky Two Point sim series. There’s just something supremely satisfying about slowly but methodically building up a thriving museum complete with decorations, gift shops, and employee-only areas. If you want a sim game that will make you laugh, tickle your brain, and suck away hours of your life, you should play <em>Two Point Museum. </em>-Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p><em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em> is part ragdoll physics racer and part serene sightseeing sim. It nails the feel of shifting your weight and controlling your momentum as you cruise down white powder slopes and perfectly manages to balance the thrill of the race with the calm satisfaction of working through each map like a platforming puzzle. It’s as exacting, elegant, and effortless in its design as it is to play. - Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/reinvention-is-key-to-god-of-wars-continued-success<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The God of War series has been an important fixture across four generations of PlayStation consoles. But when Kratos’ vengeance-filled journey to becoming the new god of war began in 2005, few could have foreseen where the angry deity destroyer would be 20 years later. Where other long-running franchises have struggled to stay relevant for multiple gaming generations, God of War has survived thanks to its willingness to change. The most important change, of course, was the radical 2018 reboot that plucked Kratos out of Ancient Greece and immersed him in the world of Norse mythology. It dramatically changed both the presentation and gameplay style of the series. But even before that critically acclaimed reboot, developer Sony Santa Monica had implemented a number of smaller, but nonetheless interesting changes that ensured the series’ survival.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reinvention will be key to God of War’s continued success in the future, too. When the series moved to its Norse setting, director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/05/future-god-of-war-games-could-take-on-egyptian-or-mayan-mythology">Cory Barlog spoke of his wish</a> of “going on to the Egyptian era and the Mayan era and so on and so forth.” <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent rumours</a> have once again brought up an Egyptian setting. Even if this is all hopeful thinking rather than genuine insider news, it’s understandable why people yearn for Kratos to visit the land of the pyramids: Ancient Egypt has a distinct culture and powerfully rich mythology. But a new setting is just the start: wherever God of War goes next, it must reinvent itself in much the same way as when it took the components that worked so well for the series’ Greek trilogy and updated (and, in some ways, improved) them for the highly acclaimed Norse games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-ragnarok-combat-1740059805617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War's combat changed significantly for the Norse games, but it stayed true to the furious spirit of the original Greek trilogy. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has never shied away from making changes from entry to entry, of course. The original Greek games evolved across the span of a decade, refining their hack and slash gameplay and polishing it to a mirror shine by the release of God of War 3. At the end of the trilogy, Kratos had access to a revamped magic system that complimented the combo-based rhythms of melee combat, and faced an even greater variety of challenging enemies. That final chapter was built for the PlayStation 3, which offered a substantial power increase over the PS2 that the first two games were designed for, and so new camera angles provided even better views of what was in 2010 a graphical powerhouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of what defined these original games was lost in the reboot. The Greek trilogy incorporated plenty of platforming and puzzle game elements to help Kratos achieve his goals. Those platforming sections were phased out of the Norse games, in part due to a change in camera angles – the new third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective just didn’t work for that kind of approach. The puzzles remained, but were reformulated to fit God of War’s new adventure-first design. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively in Valhalla, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see this kind of re-fit applied to a number of the series’ original concepts. From God of War 2 onwards, the games featured battle arenas that allowed players to set difficulty levels and choose their opponents. These formed some of the most memorable moments of the original series, but were lost in the 2018 reboot. But Valhalla, the roguelike DLC for God of War Ragnarök, featured the return of battle arenas, which had been adapted for the new Norse mythology setting. This return to a feature of the past was poetically mirrored by the DLC’s story, which saw the Norse god of war, Týr, invite Kratos to Valhalla to confront the ghosts of his past. By returning to the series’ Greek roots both mechanically and narratively, Kratos’ story came full circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Norse God of War games are not just reinterpretations of past ideas, though. This second iteration of the franchise includes a swathe of new additions, including the unique throwing mechanics for the Leviathan Axe, a combat-defining parry system enabled by a series of shield types and, in Ragnarök, a magical spear that allows for a much faster, explosive attack style. These are your tools for travelling across the Nine Realms, each of which has its own particular foes, visuals and other disparate characteristics. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/20/god-of-war-3-story-1740060215344.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The original trilogy had solid writing, but the Norse duology took God of War's story to unexpected new heights. | Image credit: Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the mechanics of battle and exploration are the obvious changes, the creative gulf between the original trilogy and the Norse duology is most clearly observed in the games’ approach to story. Across the second era, we feel the loss and heartache Kratos experiences for his late wife and how this fuels a fire within him. He is outwardly bitter towards his son, Atreus, and the pair’s uneasy relationship is at the heart of the two games. Both uncover unexpected hidden truths about themselves. All this is a far cry from the more brutish storytelling of the original trilogy, and the more emotive approach is almost certainly the key to the Norse era’s resounding critical and commercial success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War’s radical shift in both mechanical design and storytelling approach is the result of a different kind of thinking when it comes to franchises. The series’ creators have said that they don’t view the Norse games as sequels in the traditional sense, but rather as extensions of Kratos’ journey. This attitude should sit at the core of any future installments. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Norse games are not sequels in the traditional sense, but rather extensions of Kratos’ journey.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, radical reinvention on its own is not a foolproof way of generating escalating success. Just look at Assassin’s Creed, another series that has frequently changed location and time period. While consistently profitable, Ubisoft's long-running series has struggled to secure continued fan adornment across multiple console generations in the same way God of War has. Following the 2017 shift to an open world RPG design with Assassin’s Creed Origins, the series links to its foundational Assassin’s guild lore has become more and more tenuous. What began as a series linked by the story of Desmond Miles has lost much of its narrative connective tissue, and the new RPG era of games have ultimately proved more divisive with each passing installment. General criticism has been aimed at the series’ increasing content bloat – the classic “bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better” argument – but long-term fans are increasingly frustrated by the series drifting away from its assassin roots towards Spartan and Viking power fantasies. Fantasies that many believe would have been better served as standalone RPGs.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The series has now attempted a couple of course corrections, starting with 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage; a soft reboot and return to the series’ Middle Eastern roots. It revived the gameplay and structure of the earlier games and offered a considerably shorter story, which was reasonably well received by both critics and fans. This year, Assassin’s Creed Shadows looks to be continuing in a similar vein thanks to the introduction of Naoe, a character wholly dedicated to the stealth gameplay that was foundational for the original Xbox 360-era games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mixed fortunes of Assassin’s Creed’s shift in style shows that abandoning what made a series successful can cause rifts within the fanbase. This is something the God of War series has skilfully navigated. On paper, the Norse series is a radical departure, but it never lost sight of what made Kratos a compelling character, nor the series’ mechanical roots. It identified the very core of the Greek trilogy – that fiery, unrelenting combat – and built something new atop it. And with each new game, that foundation supported new evolutions. More Spartan Rage options. Cooler weapons. A stronger variety of combat options and adversaries. The ability to play as another character for sizable chunks of the story. All these additions enhanced what came before and never distracted from the foundations that made the previous games such a success. They maintain a clear sense of identity for the series, and deepen the lore rather than annex it. That is something a follow-up, be it set in Egypt or elsewhere, must continue to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the rumours of an Egyptian setting prove true, whatever comes next must ensure that its evolutionary upgrades maintain what has made God of War such a success. Back in 2018, that meant a focus on combat – the new games had to live up to the standards of the Greek trilogy when it came to butchering foes. But the next God of War will surely be judged by its story, the true gemstone at the heart of the Norse duology. The development of Kratos’ character from the rage-filled monster encountered in the original series into a sombre, complex father and leader showcases how important the writing has been in making the post-2018 games such a monumental success. Whatever comes next must be built upon that strength, while also striving to make bold new changes that will (hopefully) be remembered as the pinnacle achievement of the next era of God of War.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One thing&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536960/Shadowveil_Legend_of_The_Five_Rings/"><em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em></a> does well is invoke terror. Not just the terror of an overwhelming mass of dark energy encroaching on your fortress, which is what the story suggests; more so, the terror of hoping your little computer-controlled fighters will do the smart thing and then being forced to watch, helpless, as they are consumed by algorithmic choices, bad luck, your strategies, or some combination of all three.</p>
<p><em>Shadowveil,</em> the first video game based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings">more than 30-year-old <em>Legend of the Five Rings </em>fantasy franchise</a>, is a roguelite auto-battler. You pick your Crab Clan hero (berserker hammer-wielder or tactical support type), train up some soldiers, and assign all of them abilities, items, and buffs you earn as you go. When battle starts, you choose which hex to start your fighters on, double-check your load-outs, then click to start and watch what happens. You win and march on, or you lose and regroup at base camp, buying some upgrades with your last run's goods.</p>

<p>In my impressions after roughly seven hours of playing, <em>Shadowveil </em>could do more to soften its learning curve, but it presents a mostly satisfying mix of overwhelming odds and achievement. What's irksome now could get patched, and what's already there is intriguing, especially for the price.</p>

<p>Some necessary disclosure: Auto-battlers are not one of my go-to genres. Having responsibility for all the prep, but no control over what fighters will actually do when facing a glut of enemies, can feel punishing, unfair, and only sometimes motivating to try something different. Add that chaos and uncertainty to procedurally generated paths (like in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/slay-the-spire-the-decades-best-deckbuilding-game-coming-to-ios-in-june/">Slay the Spire</a>),</em> and sometimes the defeats felt like my fault, sometimes the random number generator's doing.</p>
<p>Losing is certainly anticipated in&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil</em>. The roguelite elements are the items and currencies you pick up from victories and carry back after defeat. With these, you can unlock new kinds of fighters, upgrade your squad members, and otherwise grease the skids for future runs. You'll have to make tough choices here, as there are more than a half-dozen resources, some unique to each upgrade type, and some you might not pick up at all in any given run.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>
