		<p>After what seems a very long wait Antstream Arcade will finally launch on PlayStation consoles today. It’s also the biggest release on the PSN ever, at least in terms of games, as Antstream has over 1,300 titles ready for you to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Antstream: Over 1300 games on PS4 &amp; PS5 - Out NOW!!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpOBPPspHAA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The service includes titles early systems like the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64, to Arcade classics and games from SNES, Megadrive, and PlayStation One, and even features classic and new arcade games. Personally I am looking forward to getting back to Xenon II on the Amiga – fun fact, a very young me featured on the advert for Xenon II and the Bitmap Brothers used to send me Christmas cards!</p>
<p>There are so many games I want to try out again: Midnight Resistance, Pinball Dreams, and Project X on the Amiga, Rolling Thunder and Operation Wolf from the arcades, California Games on the Atari Lynx, and Jack The Nipper and Monty on the Run on ZX Spectrum. Heaven!</p>
<p>Antstream also includes 600 mini game challenges, global tournaments, leader boards, achievements and more.</p>

<p>Antstream Arcade is already available on PC and Xbox, you can subscribe for a year for £39.99,&nbsp; or splash out for £99.99 which gives you a lifetime subscription.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-bit-messy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-a-bit-messy.973872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-bit-messy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard to believe it's been several years since the reveal of <em>Slitterhead</em>, with its bone-chilling and downright disturbing reveal trailer. After seeing its actual gameplay during the Summer Game Fest showcase last June, I was even more intrigued by its strange mesh of action and horror.</p>
<p>We managed to get some hands-on time with <em>Slitterhead</em> at PAX West 2024, and that initial intrigue I had is now a bit more restrained. <em>Slitterhead</em> doesn't seem like a bad game, but I'm having a difficult time grasping the vision its trying to execute.</p>

<h2><em>Slitterhead</em>'s a Bit of a Weird One</h2>
<p>Mechanically, <em>Slitterhead</em> is a smorgasbord of genres: Horror, action, and hell, even some platforming is thrown into the mix. The demo I played seemed to be a tutorial giving players a grasp of the traversal mechanics and combat, but there's a lot going on under the hood, so I wish there was more time to see what else <em>Slitterhead</em> has to offer.</p>
<p>But let's start with the premise. Well, it <em>seems</em> like players begin as a spirit than can possess and control the bodies of humans. Set in an ambiguous, densely crowded city (probably Hong Kong?), <em>Slitterhead</em> gives players ample bodies to take over as they travel around the city. Jumping from human to human is actually pretty neat as a means to get to your objective.</p>
<p>You can pop into some old lady's body, look up at some folks on a balcony from afar, jump into one of them, and then possess another person even higher up in a building to travel. In one instance, in order to get more acquainted with these mechanics, <em>Slitterhead</em> asked me to jump off a building, and right before hitting the bottom, taking over a body on the street.</p>

<p>Of course, the original host dies and a bunch of people go running in panic. Since you can't travel far without possessing someone, it necessitates jumping around like these, even at the expense of someone's life. How traversal actually plays out in the actual story is an unknown, though, since again, this was more of a tutorial asking me to reach a destination with no story impact.</p>
<p>These random people you take control of are more than just fodder used to jump around -- they're the means by which you'll fight. There are various creepy and horrific enemies the demo had me battle, and the more people you have around to take control of, the more you can switch around to dodge. And of course, if one of your hosts is nearly dead, swap to a fresh one and head back into battle.</p>

<h2><em>Slitterhead</em>'s Weirdness Extends to its Combat</h2>
<p>There's also this blood sword you use to fight enemies, which looks as badass as it sounds. You can slash with light and heavy attacks, as well as parry enemies. The parrying is a little weird here -- it's positional, so you're given an indicator where their strike might land, and you'll flick the joystick a certain way in order to (hopefully) parry the attack.</p>
<p>It took quite a few times to get used to the parry timing, and I'm not sure I like it all that much. It's not as satisfying a parry as other games, and it makes the gameplay feel a bit slow overall. Gameplay picks up near the end of my demo, however, as we discover what is called a Rarity.</p>
<p>While most humans are generic and hold no special abilities, Rarity are exceptional individuals with powerful skills. One Rarity is backed into a corner by a "Slitterhead." By possessing the Rarity, we're given these bloody claws that ferociously slash away at the enemy, and we're granted a few other abilities for damage or support effects.</p>

<p>Rarities seem to be tied to story and are likely the main characters you'll use throughout the campaign, but they aren't invincible, so you still need to use the regular people to your advantage as well. This boss we fight, a Slitterhead, transforms into some horrifying, almost Lovecraftian horror before it's defeated.</p>
<p>This boss is where I regained some enthusiasm for what's in store with <em>Slitterhead</em>. I'm not sure if I jive with the slower combat, but Rarities hold some potential; likewise, I don't know if the platforming will stay fresh across however long the campaign ends up being.</p>
<p>And though I enjoy the grimy, neon-lit aesthetic,<em> Slitterhead</em> looks quite dated. Closeups of models are disappointing, to say the least. The city is nice, but it also fails upon closer scrutiny. Overall, it failed to meet some of my expectations, along with the gameplay. Hopefully by this November, I'll be interested enough to take a look at the final release.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Larian released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a> on PC. This patch sorts out some lingering bugs and adds a number of new features to the game, including additional evil ending cinematics (more on those in a moment).</p>
<p>This patch also added official mod support to the PC version of the game, with the aim to get this patch onto consoles and Mac sometime next month.</p>
<p>However, if you are a PC player who wants to hold off updating their copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> with this recent patch for whatever reason, you can do just that.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a follow-up post to yesterday's Patch 7 announcement, the Baldur's Gate 3 developer said it had also made a Patch 6 beta branch for those " who want to to allow more time for mod authors to update their mods, continue to play on multiplayer with Mac, or keep console cross-saves working!" Huzzah!</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do, as laid out by <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1831750095118987542">Larian</a>, to head down this Patch 6 beta branch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on BG3 in your Steam Library &gt; Properties &gt; Betas</li>
<li>On Beta Participation select: release_patch6_hf9</li>
</ol>
<p>And, that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>So, now... those evil endings I mentioned. Please note, the below <strong>will contain spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, so if you want to keep any ending details as a surprise, this image break is your cue to head elsewhere now.</p>

<p>Right, let's have at it.</p>
<p>Larian has well and truly delivered with its batch of evil ending cinematics, so much so that Baldur's Gate 3's tiefling Barbarian Karlach was actually trending on social media yesterday. As pointed out by one <a href="https://x.com/gali_le0/status/1831725884174172231">fan</a>, Karlach's ending is "absolutely metal", with the tiefling going "absolutely insane! Holy shit, what a delivery!!"</p>

<p>This ending sees Karlach ripping her heart out of her chest, having released a lot of not so friendly beasties on the city folk. Oof! </p>

<p>Larian previously stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.

<p>Karlach's actor Samantha Béart seems pleased with how these new endings have been received, sharing one particularly enthusiastic response to the tiefling's portrayal.</p>

			<p>Almost ten years after its original release, Bloodborne is finally getting some impressive visual improvements thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator and the hard work of modders.</p>
<p>Well-known Souls series modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, shared a video earlier this week showcasing the game with full dynamic shadows, which improve the visuals quite a bit. Obviously, their inclusion impacts performance greatly in certain scenarios, but as emulation improves, so should performance with similar mods aiming to enhance visuals.</p>
<p><iframe title="I added dynamic shadows to ALL of Bloodborne PC (and more ShadPS4 progress, too!)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XXSVFJ7wJ8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The modder also shared an additional Bloodborne gameplay video showcasing how the game runs on the ShadPS4 emulator currently and how far it is possible to go into the main campaign before it becomes unplayable. When the game runs well, emulation is extremely accurate, and with the rapid pace the ShadPS4 developers have been improving the emulator, it really won't take much longer to have the game fully playable on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="I play Bloodborne on PC for an hour &amp; ascend to a Great One (derogatory)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kzRnMWwf44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Full dynamic shadows aren't the only improvement fromsoftserve is working on for Bloodborne. The modder already released the first version of an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-upgraded-texture-pack-remaster/">Upgraded Texture Pack</a> which will eventually enhance all of the game's textures.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that is making it possible to play Bloodborne on PC can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>At some point during development, Black Myth: Wukong featured online multiplayer, as revealed in a new video shared online earlier this week.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LiPuDeDongZai">Outrageous Dong Chai</a>, shows the references to the scrapped online multiplayer mode that can still be found in the game's code. While the entire video is only available in Chinese, there's no doubt that the user's findings are related to online multiplayer with options like creating and joining rooms, role configuration, and more. As Black Myth: Wukong is getting expanded in the future to further extend the title's life and increase its sales from the already impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million figure</a>, which was achieved in only two weeks, the addition of a multiplayer mode would extend the game's life even further than a few simple expansions could.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide and will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/">yet-to-be-determined release date</a>. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

A1 cards will still perform just as well while running games, but you'll find yourself waiting significantly longer for the file downloads to finalize when first installing anything. If you've got speedy internet, this is important, as A2 SD cards will allow you to take full advantage of those download speeds and start gaming ASAP. Plus, these SD cards aren't just for gaming, you can effectively use them across phones, tablets, cameras, and more as well.</p><h2>Budget to Best: SD Card Deals</h2><div id="180659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Samsung Evo Select 1TB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/N6vDY?object_uuid=1a458a0b-d7ac-48d5-8148-6e872aca1702&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$16.52</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lrWwW?object_uuid=1a458a0b-d7ac-48d5-8148-6e872aca1702&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics Micro SDXC Memory Card with Full Size Adapter, A2, U3, Read Speed up to 100 MB/s, 128GB, Black<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$12.07</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/drO7K?object_uuid=1a458a0b-d7ac-48d5-8148-6e872aca1702&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SanDisk 128GB microSDXC-Card, Licensed for Nintendo-Switch<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$18.88</span></li></ul></div><p>TeamGroup is a great SD card to consider, but if you want to opt for a better known brand, then we've got you covered there as well.

                <p>Actors union SAG-AFTRA, which also represents voice actors, has announced that companies behind 80 games have agreed to its terms over the use of AI, while voice actors and mo-cap performers continue to strike against major industry players. The contracts, which include both tiered-budget and interim agreements, will allow performers more employment opportunities as the strike continues.</p><p>The video game actors' strike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">began on July 26</a> this year, with the union demanding fair AI protection for its members. At the beginning of the strike, SAG-AFTRA said that studios would need to sign one of three agreements offering "critical AI protections" if they wanted to hire union talent for covered work, which includes all games that started development after September 2023.</p><p>Currently, 80 games are covered by one of these agreements, a statistic that SAG-AFTRA says proves its terms are reasonable and fair for businesses. "We applaud those video game companies signing our tiered-budget and interim agreements," said SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. "Not only are they doing the right thing by their workers; they’re also helping to preserve the human art, ingenuity, and creativity that fuels interactive storytelling. These agreements signal that the video game companies in the collective-bargaining group do not represent the will of the larger video game industry."</p><p>Some of the studios that have already signed agreements include Lightspeed L.A., which is currently working on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-sentinel-announced-with-gripping-debut-trailer/1100-6519787/" data-ref-id="1100-6519787">debut game Last Sentinel</a>, as well as Ark: Survival Evolved developer Studio Wildcard and indie studio Little Bat Games.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA adds that some of the games that have signed agreements weren't covered by the strike order to begin with, but have now guaranteed that actors' performances both past and present will be protected from unregulated AI use.</p><p>The voice actors' strike will continue, with the major industry players involved in the bargaining still yet to come to an agreement with SAG-AFTRA. The companies involved in the negotiations include EA, Activision, Take-Two, WB Games, and more. It has been confirmed that GTA 6 will be unaffected by the strike, and current live-service games are also exempt from the strike action.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> publisher Focus Entertainment has clarified players do not need to link their Steam account to Epic Games in order to play the game.</p>
<p>When launching the game on Steam, an Epic Online Services client is installed once the game's EULA (End User Licence Agreement) is accepted. This is to support optional crossplay between players on both platforms and to synchronise friend lists between them, <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833">Focus confirmed in a forum post</a>.</p>
<p>"However, please be aware linking your Steam and Epic accounts is not required to enjoy the game," the company wrote. "These features are entirely optional and will not affect your gameplay experience in any way."</p>

</figure>
<p>However, players have since complained of "stealth installation of Epic Online Services" and have, of course, review bombed the game on Steam in protest.</p>
<p>Clearly there's been a misunderstanding from players through a seeming lack of transparency from the developer. Perhaps they just clicked through the EULA too quickly. As one reddit user wrote, it's "a touch egregious".</p>
<p>The EULA itself, from developer Saber, is now standard in games. It seems some players didn't read it in full.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="563"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f9ule0/space_marine_2_is_sitting_at_55_on_steam_due_to/">Space Marine 2 is sitting at 55% on Steam due to stealth installation of Epic Online Services, Saber EULA which makes you acknowledge and consent to the processing and transfer of personal data collection, and bugs.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/saltysteve0621/">u/saltysteve0621</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/">Warhammer40k</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Space Marine 2 follows Earth Defence Force 6, released back in July, which had a similar Epic requirement for crossplay that frustrated players.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Epic Games for clarification on its client requirements for crossplay.</p>
<p>Perhaps a precedent of sorts was set by Sony at the start of the year, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> required players link their Steam accounts with PSN. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned due to player backlash</a>, but then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">put back in place</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>While Space Marine 2 had a "mixed" review shortly after launch, it's now risen to "mostly positive" as players perhaps understand more of the situation following the comments from Focus.</p>
<p>"Space Marine 2's campaign is a spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up to the original, but the game's grisly combat shines best in its cooperative Operations mode," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Eurogamer Space Marine 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>And if you are experiencing more tangible issues with the game, such as game crashes or controller issues, the Focus forum post provides potential workarounds for each.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Gearbox developers working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">thoroughly upset some fans</a>. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC fell short of your expectations," said the developers in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4608959311771420255">a Steam update post accompanying the patch notes</a>. "That feedback is fair. We’d like to take a moment and walk everyone through our plan to make it right."</p>
<p>A lot of the issues seem to have stemmed from a bug that "occasionally led to behaviors being erroneously tied to FPS." You can see why this might bother players on a slower PC. For example, one weapon, <a href="https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crowdfunder">the Crowdfunder</a>, would stop firing if the player's frame rate dipped below 30 frames per second. (This sounds similar to a bug reported in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> following its Lightfall expansion, by which any damage the player took from enemies was <a href="https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-enemy-damage-fps-link/">seemingly tied to the player's frame rate</a>). It's a substantial error. But considering the sheer amount of overlapping and ultra-stacking relics and effects in Risk Of Rain 2, I'm not surprised the code is easy to break. </p>
<p>That particular frame rate bug is now fixed, claim the developers, alongside a long list of other issues, like the cheekily invulnerable final boss, and another bug that prevented players from picking up items (somewhat important in a fast-paced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>). </p>
<p>"First, to be clear, we're committed to making the DLC everything that you expected and deserve," the developer continues. "This is a game that countless people love; anything that jeopardizes that experience is something we take very seriously. We hope that in the coming days and weeks, we can earn back your trust, and we know that’s going to take time and action."</p>
<p>The poorly optimised DLC garnered some annoyance but also some sympathy, in particular from Risk Of Rain's original creators at Hopoo Games (they sold the rights to Gearbox in 2022). "Definitely a hard situation for everyone involved," said the roguelike's co-creator Duncan Drummond last week. Since then, Drummond and his co-founder Paul Morse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-creators-wind-down-work-on-unannounced-project-and-take-jobs-at-valve">shuttered their studio so they could take jobs at Valve</a> along with other workers at Hopoo. In other words, it's been a dramatic couple of weeks for Risk Of Rain 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spectre-divide-reduces-cosmetic-skin-price-from-90-to-70-after-backlash.973803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cosmetic-skins-spectre-divide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spectre Divide, a new free-to-play 3v3 competitive shooter, has reduced its cosmetic skin prices by 17-25% following criticism that they are too high.</p>



<p>Mountaintop Studios, the development team behind Spectre Divide, announced its plans on Discord yesterday. The announcement read, “First and foremost—my personal apologies for the situation. We’ve heard the feedback on pricing, and we’re going to make some big adjustments.” Those “big adjustments” include a 17-25% reduction in the prices of weapons and characters across the board.</p>



<p>However, Mountaintop Studios has still faced criticism for the move as its skin prices are still way too high. One bundle, named the ‘Cryo Kinesis Masterpiece bundle’ will set players back 7000 Spectre Points, equivalent to $70.</p>



<p>For that price, for which you can buy a fully-fledged AAA title, you’ll get four very basic weapon camos and an axe melee weapon (which is still just a cosmetic overhaul to a knife).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even more concerning to players is that the bundle already had a 25% discount before the recent change, which would have set players back nearly $120. </p>



<p>Following the recent change, the game’s next bundle, named the “Medusa Bundle,” is cheaper but will still set you back 3400 Spectre Points, equivalent to $34. </p>



<p>Spectre Divide is out now for PC, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-console-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console versions of the game</a> expected to be released in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Spectre Divides’ overly priced cosmetic skins? Let us know in the comment below!</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s price is increasing from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) later today, 6th September.</p>
<p>The team says it feels "like this is a fair increase based on the amount of content and playtime added to the game since Early Access started almost four years ago".</p>

<p>"Thank you to all the dedicated Ghost Hunters worldwide for your ongoing support. We’re excited to welcome new recruits when Phasmophobia is released on PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X|S later this year."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia has indeed changed significantly since it first launched in early access four years ago.</p>
<p>Not only are there extra ghosts, maps, and difficulties, but substantial changes have also been made to your ghost-hunting tech, ghost behaviours, and challenges.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Developer Kinetic gave players "two-three" hours notice of the changes a couple of hours ago, so if you've yet to bite but are keen to lock it in at the early access price, you'd better move like a Jinn and grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all ghosthunters are happy with the price increase, which works out to be a 41 percent hike here in the UK.</p>
<p>"Here's an idea, maybe hold off on price gouging future hunters (console players) until you include one of the main features, voice recognition, that makes the game more immersive, and unique. It's only fair to hold off until you can release a full game, not just a half-assed one," <a href="https://x.com/JessicaMosley86/status/1831970577554518311">said</a> one.</p>
<p>"It's a disgrace they are upping the price without adding the voice recognition for consoles," added <a href="https://x.com/skippy1090/status/1831974746357199032">another</a>. "After the bs them saying it would be released a while back. No communication what so ever. I own it on PC but want it for console too."</p>
<p>There's currently still no word on when the ghost-hunting adventure will be released on console, but Kinetic says it's still due "later this year".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 quests are live; players can acquire 100,000 XP with this week’s quests. Fortnite’s weekly quests are the best way to gain XP and progress up the battle pass tiers, which is especially helpful for the Absolute Doom season, with all the Marvel-themed cosmetics up for grabs. Check out Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 Quests guide below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-3-quests-list">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 Quests List</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 3 quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-fortnite-week-3-quests">How to Complete Fortnite Week 3 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-with-the-monarch-pistol">Damage opponents with the Monarch Pistol</h3>



<p>The first quest is simple, but acquiring the Monarch Pistol can take time. Players can find this weapon in common and rare chests across the island. If you are confident, you can defeat Doombot to get a hold of his legendary Monarch Pistol. Once you have the weapon, inflict 300 damage on any enemy player or NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-collect-ammo-while-you-have-a-specialist-hired">Collect ammo while you have a specialist hired.</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 3 quest could be the easiest one of the season. All you need to do is head to Redline Rig or Grand Glacier and hire a specialist. Then, keep opening ammo boxes and chests in the area until the quest is completed. You only need 50 bullets to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-collect-weapons-from-eliminated-opponents">Collect weapons from eliminated opponents</h3>



<p>Now, this Fortnite Week 3 quest requires some skill from the players. You have to collect 15 weapons from eliminated opponents. However, you can complete this quest across multiple matches. To complete this quest, you can either approach aggressively and confront players at hotspots or play the long game and eliminate opponents as the match progresses.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-travel-distance-in-a-vehicle-while-boosting">Travel distance in a vehicle while boosting</h3>



<p>To complete this Fortnite Week 3 quest, get in a car and keep spamming the boost until you have covered 500 meters.&nbsp;Luckily, vehicles are spread across the island, so it shouldn’t take players too long to complete this.</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-2-quests-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 2 Quests Guide</a></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-within-10-seconds-of-sprinting">Damage opponents within 10 seconds of sprinting</h3>



<p>The last quest for Fortnite Week 3 is challenging because it is time-consuming. Firstly, you must remember to sprint just before shooting at any enemy on the island. Also, you have to inflict 3,000 points of damage, which is challenging. Consider taking on Doombot or Emma Frost while completing this quest to get it done quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s all the quests for Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, Week 3. In the comments, let us know which ones you will complete first.&nbsp;</p>

Activision is set to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October, so perhaps the shooter will make an appearance. Blizzard, fresh from releasing World of Warcraft expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within">The War Within</a>, has Diablo 4 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a> out in October, as well as ongoing updates for mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>.

            <p>Remedy is set to update its original version of Alan Wake on PC, removing David's Bowie's Space Oddity from the credits in the process.</p>
<p>This, the developer has said, is due to "changes in licensing". Once this update goes live, players will instead be met with an original song by Petri Alanko, known as Strange Moons.</p>
<p>Alanko has also composed music for a number of Remedy's other games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control.</p>

<p>Resharing Remedy's post, Alanko said the upcoming replacement song was "written from a point of view of an astronaut who does have quite a few problems. But even _that_ is okay, as it is what it is".</p>
<p>The composer furthered this upcoming change to the original game "wasn't completely out of scratch (heh), as a section of the song was originally in a level in OG AW, but that level was cut out long before release".</p>
<p>This Alan Wake update will be going ahead this coming Tuesday, 10th September, across Steam, Epic Games Store and GOG. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Well, original Alan Wake players won't be able to from then.</p> <div>

<p>Having initially released in 2010 on Xbox 360, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-will-see-the-xbox-360-classic-finally-debut-on-playstation">Alan Wake got the remaster treatment</a> in 2021. This remaster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-ditching-originals-product-placement">ditched the original game's hefty product placement</a>. A sequel, aptly named Alan Wake 2, was then released last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-design-teased-by-sony-in-30th-anniversary-post-announcement-is-inbound-and-launch-is-set-for-november/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-render-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first look at the PS5 Pro earlier this week, and Sony has now basically confirmed the design as part of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation's 30th anniversary blog post</a>. In the celebratory image, Sony sneakily added a mockup that seems very much in line with the leaked one.</p>

<p>While reporting the story, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that developers have been told all games launched on or after September 16 will have to support the PlayStation 5 Pro, hinting at an inbound announcement. Insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the current plan is to launch the mid-generation console refresh in November, thus mimicking perfectly the September announcement and November release seen during the last generation for the PlayStation 4 Pro, as we had surmised when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> developers talking freely about it at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Next week is probably the right week for the PS5 Pro announcement, then, and the excitement may not end there for PlayStation fans. Another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> that Sony is also preparing a new State of Play broadcast to show off first-party games on the week of November 19-20.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we know about the PS5 Pro so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>45% performance improvement in rasterized rendering thanks to a larger GPU and faster memory</li>
<li>Hugely improved ray tracing architecture delivering 2-3x speedup on average, with peaks of 4x</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS at 8-bit to power the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique, Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm.</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-Aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires inputs similar to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. It also does not require per-game training like the latest version of DLSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no info on the pricing yet, but we'll let you know as soon as there is a credible rumor on the topic.</p>

            <p>About 12 years ago, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-survivors-jasper-byrnes-new-game-canned">drew our breath in pain to report</a> that Lone Survivor developer Jasper Byrne's new "Zelda x Demon's Souls" action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was no more. "It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you never played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lone-survivor">Lone Survivor</a>, it's an excellent side-scrolling survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> that mixes together ideas from Silent Hill into something wholly its own. "The strongest praise I can supply is that this is a game clearly made by a man who understands why people still hope for a return to the glory of Silent Hill 2," Adam Smith (rest in BG3) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-lone-survivor">wrote in 2012</a>. "It's a game made by someone who appreciates that the best way to get under someone's skin is to make them think about that skin, not just the way that it peels off when a knife is applied, but the way that if feels to touch, the way that it covers our skulls and helps us to express ourselves, and the way that it wrinkles and ages." I will only add that the soundtrack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFiBkP3krjs">bangs</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure when, exactly, Byrne decided to revive his action-RPG project - he's been <a href="https://x.com/PRDXCL">posting WIP screens for years</a>, perhaps more for the pleasure of sharing than as an indicator of progress - but in <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830588551526027732">one of this week's surprise Xitter updates</a>, he says he rewrote the whole thing to run in Unity at some stage. He also took an extended break from development when Covid hit. "[It] feels so fresh after a nearly 5 year hiatus," reads <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">another TwiXter post</a>. "i never fell out of love with it but when covid started i got too much anxiety about it and made the call to hit pause. i only recently felt brave enough to try, so i'm seeing how it feels to work on again. let's see what happens".</p>
<p>Here's a shot of the project from 2013, back when it ran on the Blitzmax engine.</p>

<p>And here's one of the screens Byrne has shared this week. I really like the fog and how the choice of perspective works with the terrain textures.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_wGJAMxv.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Jasper Byrne</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">a further update</a>, Byrne says that he's "written down the 8 milestones needed to get this thing out the door. nothing but the bare minimum, because 12 years is plenty enough already". Fingers crossed it's relatively smooth sailing from here. If you'd like to give him a hand, and you've yet to play Lone Survivor, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1907440/Super_Lone_Survivor/">a remastered version on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s players have been complaining about a string of issues surfacing in the game recently. Issues including in-raid freezes, sudden black screens and other visual glitches have been reported, and Battlestate Games has <strong>just </strong>outlined why that is.</p>



<p>According to the developer, it’s a problem with the Discord overlay, which is causing conflicts within Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-don-t-use-it">Just Don’t Use It</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has advised that players ‘enjoy VoIP features in Escape from Tarkov’ while the Discord issues are resolved, and they assured the community that Discord developers are hot on the case. </p>



<p>In the meantime, perhaps you could use something like Teamspeak, which has one of the best social media profiles in the business on Twitter that’s packed full of self-deprecation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Recent player issues that resulted in black screen, raid freezes and other visual problems are caused by Discord overlay not working properly. </p><p>Stay tuned for updates from Discord developers and enjoy VoIP features in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EscapefromTarkov</a>.</p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1831968536631406609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>This isn’t the first major issue to surface in Escape from Tarkov recently. In the last few days, players have also been wrestling with a cross-platform glitch between Tarkov and Tarkov Arena that has been resetting tasks. Battlestate had to turn off the linking/synching functionality while it investigated this problem.</p>



<p>It’s relatively typical for the top-tier extraction shooter, though. Every time the game wipes and a major update is introduced, problems are sure to surface. It has been a rough year for Escape from Tarkov, and it seems as though the game still isn’t out of the woods just yet.</p>

<p>Concord is going offline today after just a few days on the market, which is sure to break the hearts of the several hundred players who enjoyed it. In a record-short time, Concord imploded, thanks to a lacklustre marketing campaign, no existing fanbase, and a premium price point – plus character designs that flopped immeasurably in the face of the community.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the last we’re seeing of the game. It has been claimed that it’s still slated to appear in Prime Video’s Secret Level,  an anthology series revealed by Tim Miller during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-forgotten-but-not-gone">Forgotten But Not Gone</h2>



<p>Concord might have failed as a game, but there’s still a chance that it can succeed as an animated episode as part of Secret Level, a 15-part series focused on various franchises like God of War, Crossfire, Armored Core, and of course, Concord itself. </p>



<p>Each game will get a standalone, one-shot episode as part of Secret Level, which was the most hyped-up announcement during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live event.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent report by IGN</a>, it was claimed that sources close to the production have confirmed that Concord will remain in Secret Level, despite being such a travesty of a title that fell flat on its face immediately after being released.</p>



<p>Tim Miller is working as the executive producer of the series. Historically, he has appeared in works like Deadpool (director), Love, Death &amp; Robots (producer), and Sonic the Hedgehog (executive producer).</p>



<p>Are you eager to see what’s made of Concord when Secret Level airs on Prime Video?</p>

I absolutely <em>adore</em> the HD-2D visual aesthetic from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series, and I'll play anything that employs it. Is your game unpolished with a bug that may or may not ruin save files? I'll take my chances with it in HD-2D. Am I also looking at a 30-hour plot that reads like your intern randomly threw up gobstoppers labelled with names, places, and plot twists? How concerning—now gimme my HD-2D.</p><p>Obviously, if you choose to wrap this modern-meets-ancient art-style around one of the most celebrated RPGs of the golden age of gaming, well, winged serpents could not drag me away from your HD-2D quest.</p><p>I'll clear my calendar for such a rejig, even if I didn't grow up with the NES original because it didn't launch in my country. For a few Aussies, like me, our introduction to DQ3 was a Game Boy port of the SNES refresh, which sold a million cartridges on launch day in '96. Apparently, it also caused 300 Japanese fans to be arrested for truancy—a bit of gaming trivia I love almost as much as HD-2D.</p><p>Speaking of delaying education, I'm going to tell you what to expect with Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake in two shakes of a Jackanape's tail. For now, though, let's service the needs of the "mind's already made up" types, because I know you exist.

It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">faithful remake</a> that, despite the significant graphical revamp and refined narrative elements, doesn’t stray too far from the source material. </p><p>If you're already an uber fan, you'd know that the first three Dragon Quest games represent the Erdrick Trilogy, and (kinda sorta spoilers) this third installment was actually a prequel that outlines the first steps of the adventure. Semi-confusing, no?
</p><p>Anyway, you must fill the 16-bit boots of a 16-year-old child of a hero named Ortega, who was sent to defeat the villainous Baramos. Your old man cocked it up, so the king sends you and a group of companions to rectify his mistakes. 
</p><p>By the by, it should also be mentioned that you're not going to hit end credits and be left in a narrative lurch for long—<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-and-2-hd-2d-announced-along-with-3-remake-release-date-nintendo-direct-2024">Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD-2D</a> upgrades are in the pipeline for 2025. It's very much worth getting in on the ground floor now if you've been wondering what all the fuss is with this (soon to be) 12-games-thick franchise.
</p><p>While I only had roughly an hour's worth of hands on with DQ3, I found it to be surprisingly delightful and engaging, despite the somewhat creaky bones source material. I'm told that there will be new story elements and never before seen vocations for its heroes. Sounds like cutting room floor stuff that the diehard faithful will drool over. </p><p>Getting into the technicals, I noted Performance and Graphics modes on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, and more. The former translates to 60 frames per second, and the latter is a 4K resolution. Not sure why we can't have both there, to be honest. This being a turn-based combat affair with the only major motion being your top-down traipsings across the overworld...I just went 4K and was perfectly happy.  </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><p>I also noted that the devs are offering a choice between two protagonist appearances and three difficulty settings. If you do take the plunge there, you can always fall back on some quality of life features, including autosaves (with manual saves still available). Given that the combat here is light on the animations to preserve the OG feel, I was glad for the ability to speed the fisticuffs up with my shoulder buttons. Just give me my XP and a host of victory affirming, 16-bit-esque sound effects, please and thank you.</p><p>Other welcome additions included two camera modes, and a mini map which could be toggled on. I also love this feature and wish it  was in more RPGs that I have to finish in dribs and drabs—an NPC conversation log that saves the last 30 interactions.</p><p>Looking back through my notes, it seems I also appreciated the now vestigial visual aesthetic where towns in the overworld appear like miniatures when compared to your super-deformed party. It's also cool that the level designers add in rolling topography to what were once pancake grid overworlds, not to mention some gorgeous dappled light caused by foreground trees and moving clouds up beyond your vision. It's modern things such as this—like the day/night cycle shoehorned in—that really make one appreciate the extra effort gone into enhancing this in sensible, non-destructive ways.</p><p>Unless my eyeballs and instincts are deceiving me, this package already has the feeling of being built by a team who worship the original article. Playing a remake like that is always an infectious experience, and I can't wait to fill the gaps in my understanding of the "in the beginning" of a series I came to love later in the piece. November 15th can't arrive soon enough.</p><p><em>Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.

<p>If you spend time on the Steam forums, you probably know by now that people aren’t too excited about the system requirements for The Forever Winter. They’re beastly, requiring a potent gaming computer to run successfully. Here’s what you can expect from the minimum and recommended requirements for the extraction shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-forever-winter-pc-system-requirements">The Forever Winter PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you’ll soon see from The Forever Winter’s system requirements, the game requires a monster of a gaming computer to run its recommended systems. The GPU and CPU will certainly set most people back a significant amount. It’s definitely going to limit the number of people playing the game with the graphics maxed out!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super (8 GB) / Radeon RX 5700XT (8 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT (16 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<p>While we don’t yet know how much storage space is necessary, you definitely want to install this one on an SSD to ensure you load into a raid promptly. You could lose a lot of gear, like in Escape From Tarkov, by loading in late.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-content-is-available-in-early-access">How Much Content is Available in Early Access?</h2>



<p>When The Forever Winter launches at the end of September into Early Access, it will do so with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Four complete maps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Five playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dozens of unique weapons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You can customize those weapons, by the way!</p>
