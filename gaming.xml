<figure><a title="ff7 remake key cards" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c85095d27f296/ff7-remake-key-cards.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SQUARE ENIX</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you're doubtless well aware at this point, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> is winging its way onto Switch 2 on 22nd January 2026, and we are super, super (add a few more supers) excited about it. Especially this writer, in fact, because he's managed to start the remake several times on other systems and has yet to actually finish it. Portable play will remedy this.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the release of the Switch 2 version of Square Enix's masterpiece, its director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been chatting to German site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JPGames</a> (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-understands-players-qualms-about-switch-2-game-key-cards-but-for-aaa-devs-its-a-way-to-overcome-loading-speed-limitations/">Automaton</a>) about those dreaded Game-Key Cards, and it seems he's of the opinion that they are a necessary evil, thanks to the a speed drawback with Nintendo's Switch 2 carts.</p>
<p>During the interview, Hamaguchi is quoted saying that, “Among developers, the discussion about the keycard format is perhaps a bit different to what fans maybe expect," pointing out that whilst the actual storage size of carts is important, it's the speed of loading high-end, AAA games and their huge assets that's the key issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think perhaps the biggest issue for developers, certainly for people like us who make high-end HD games, is the loading speed, because you compare that to the solid-state drive and the speed you can get from loading from that, it’s going to be inferior to that, it just has to be, that’s the way the media works, physically. So that’s the bigger issue, really, in terms of making games, making high-end games for the Switch 2, and what it allows, obviously, by doing a semi-download version of the game, you can then use the SSD and rely on that for that smoother loading. So that’s perhaps the bigger issue in terms of a developer."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hamaguchi is careful to clarify that he understands gamers' reaction to the Game-Key Card solution. "I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it," he says, "and there are good reasons and debates to have there."</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">heard from a Star Wars Outlaws dev</a> about how the use of Game-Key Cards for that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">stellar port</a> helped with streaming assets, loading, and all of the benefits you'd expect from a faster storage and information-streaming system versus having that data transferred from a separate cart.</p>
<p>And so it would seem that, as far as Game-Key Cards go, and as much as Hamaguchi says he can sympathise with how players feel, the controversial 'physical' option will continue to be used as a necessary part of getting big Switch 2 games on store shelves. Be sure to check out the director's entire response at <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JPGames.de</a>.</p>

<p><em>How do you feel about Game-Key Cards now that devs are airing their thoughts on how running the game off internal memory benefits the porting of AAA games? Has your opinion changed? Let us know below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like its predecessors, Ninja Gaiden 4 will feature multiple difficulty settings, such as the accessible Hero mode and the challenging Master Ninja mode, allowing players of all skill levels to enjoy the game's intense and bloody combat.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-livestream-forza-horizon-6/">today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast</a> provides the first look at these two difficulty modes. Hero mode, created to allow newcomers to the series and character-action games to enjoy the game's challenging experience, features different toggles for Auto Evade, Auto Block, and Auto Assist that allow players to build the foundation needed to switch to Normal or Hard mode without being overwhelmed by enemies. This foundation can also be built using the newly announced Training mode, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Master Ninja mode, on the other hand, will sit at the exact opposite end of the spectrum in terms of difficulty. The most challenging Ninja Gaiden 4 difficulty setting, which cannot be changed in-game once selected at the beginning of a playthrough, will require true skill to complete, with new enemy placements, late game enemies appearing earlier, and more aggressive enemy AI. </p>



<p>Hero difficulty mode and its toggles won't be the only accessibility options featured in Ninja Gaiden 4. On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/how-ninja-gaiden-4-curates-a-challenge-for-each-and-every-player/">Xbox Wire</a>, it was confirmed that the game will feature options such as disabling Hit Lag or Hit Stop, hiding the Lock-on Marker, Highlight Game Elements to free-hand recolor a wide range of objects, multiple controller options, including Left-handed Inverted Controls, and more.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While all of the newly revealed additions are quite welcome, based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">my experience with the game during Gamescom 2025</a>, the Master Ninja difficulty changes will be appreciated by fans of the genre looking for a real challenge, as regular enemies in the demo were mostly waiting around to be taken down quickly, instead of taking advantage of their greater numbers as they should have.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 launches on October 21 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in the successful racing series, is launching in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">previously teased by a reliable insider</a>, the sixth entry in the series was officially announced with a short announcement trailer shown during today's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast. In development by both longtime series developer Playground Games and Turn10, the developers of the Forza Motorsport series, Forza Horizon 6 will bring players to Japan, the most-requested location since the series began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXedKqX5Wa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Following the announcement trailer's release, a new post went up on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/">Xbox Wire</a>, where Art Director Don Arceta and Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita commented on the choice of setting. Besides being the most requested location from fans of the series, Japan has a unique culture that makes it perfect as a setting for an entry in the Forza Horizon series, thanks to how the country uniquely blends traditional buildings like shrines with modern buildings like workshops. The timing was also right, as current technology finally allows a proper representation of Japan.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will also take advantage of the Japanese setting in other interesting ways. The series' season change mechanics will be brought up to a new level in the game, as different seasons will have a dramatic impact on the landscape and playable world, according to Arceta. The new system will also truly inform the world, subtly changing activities and sound. This attention to detail will be evident in the entirety of the experience, with ambient audio that will instantly tell the player which season they are currently in.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is slated for a 2026 launch on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. More will be revealed in early 2026.</p>

Bruce Lee is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman</a> now. Unfortunately, you don’t get to play as him. Fortunately, you do not have to fight him. Oh, don’t look at me like that, Agent 47. You might be the last word in swatting people with Wet Floor signs, but I’ve yet to see you perform a credible one-inch punch. Perhaps you’d get the drop on Bruce Lee if you threw up on him after swallowing an irradiated carbon rod, but I don’t fancy your chances in the context of a proper Bangkok martial arts tournament - like the one depicted in Hitman’s latest Elusive Target mission, the Dragon. Here be trailer.

<p>
Available from today, 25th September, until Thursday 20th November, the free Infiltrator Elusive Target update both marks Bruce Lee’s 85th anniversary and reinvents him as an agent of the ICA. Lee is trying to infiltrate the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> Union crime syndicate by way of a martial arts tournament at the Himmapan Hotel. His job is to flatten a few faces and uncover the Concord Union’s supreme leader. Your job is to stop people sabotaging the tournament. 
</p>
<p>
I imagine this will be stuff like identifying terrain traps and intercepting people who want to spike Bruce Lee’s trademark pre-fight Mai Tai with 14-day-old cat litter. No, I don’t know whether Bruce Lee really drank Mai Tais, but in my defence, I didn’t know he was a secret agent, either. We're blundering in the dark!
</p><p>
The Elusive Target accompanies the time-limited release of a Bruce Lee DLC pack that grants permanent access to the Dragon contract, together with Lee’s yellow tracksuit, some kali sticks, a jade dagger, some golden dragon scissors, and some cosmetics for your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a> Safehouse. All yours for $4.99, €4.99 or £3.99. I would not pay that much for some scissors, not even if they were all yellow and draconic, but you do you. Now, please savour this roadmap of upcoming Hitmen content.
</p>

<p>
I’m interested to know how well-received the time-limited nature of these Elusive Targets are. The model makes more sense in Hitman’s universe of shifting allegiances and identities, and doesn’t seem to have roused quite the same opprobrium directed at other developers who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-to-stop-removing-old-expansions-starting-with-lightfall-in-february">remove stuff from their games</a>. I’m also keen to know if there’s the option to simply watch the martial arts tournament in the Dragon. It would be a terrible waste of Lee’s charisma if we had to spend the whole time facing away from the arena, tripping over karate students holding sports bottles full of acid.
</p>
<p>Jeet Kune Do legends aside, Io Interactive have just updated the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy on PC with the same VR support previously offered by PSVR2 on console. This allows you to "dual-wield weapons, interact with disguises, and use their environment creatively thanks to intuitive motion controls, full ambidexterity, and room-scale implementation". It's compatible with all campaign locations from all three games, together with the Freelancer strategy roguelike mode.</p>
<p>Io's wider activities include a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-first-proper-footage-reveals-a-posh-blockbuster-with-bubbles-of-hitman">James Bond game</a>. I'm pretty sure Agent 47 could take James Bond.</p>

                <p>On the opening night of Gamescom last month, Capcom and Square Enix revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> collaboration that will touch the worlds of both games. Now, Capcom has revealed that its side of the crossover is starting Monday, September 29 with the arrival of its Free Title Update 3. That news came with a fresh trailer that shows off what happens when the worlds of Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14 collide.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1iBhq-C90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ca1iBhq-C90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, FF14's Omega Planetes has found a way into the Monster Hunter world, and it's going to take some teamwork to defeat this mechanical monstrosity. To combat Omega Planetes, two new FF14 jobs are being introduced in Wilds: Dark Knight and Pictomancer. The former gives players Dark Knight-themed armor that can create damage-absorbing barriers and push back against heavy attacks. Pictomancers essentially create images that unleash powerful spells against their enemies.</p><p>Several Final Fantasy 14-inspired cosmetics will be unlockable in this update, including a Chocobo seikret skin and new gestures. The trailer also teases December's Free Title Update 4, which will feature the return of Gogmazios, an elder dragon who hasn't been huntable in the game since Monster Hunters 4 Ultimate in 2015. </p><p>Although Capcom recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, the PC port's optimization issues won't be directly addressed by Free Title Update 3. Capcom has previously stated that those issues will be the focus of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>, which doesn't currently have a date tied to it.</p>

            <p>Treyarch has highlighted two of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 multiplayer maps set in Japan during today's incredibly dry Xbox Game Showcase during Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>The two maps - Toshin and Den - are two of the 18 multiplayer maps available at launch. These two highlighted maps will be playable in the Black Ops 7 open beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">which kicks off on 2nd October</a>.</p>
<p>The first map highlighted was Toshin, which is set within a Japanese city. Split into two distinct districts, players can fight through the tight alleys of Old Town or the tech-heavy main streets. There's a broken down monorail, and even a cat cafe present here, though thankfully no actual cats to distract from tense firefights from what we can see.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 has been<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever"> set up as the "most mind-bending Black Ops ever"</a>, leaning on the more psychological aspects of the series for this latest instalment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launched in just under a month on 21st October, Team Ninja and Platinum Games have shared some new gameplay and talked about some key new difficulty features for the game, including an easier “Hero Mode” that adds gameplay assists.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Difficulty Design | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ccI2SOsD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hero Mode is a nice way of saying Easy Mode, and sits below the Normal difficulty. The main difference is that it adds assists like auto-dodge and auto-guard, so that new players can acclimatise themselves to the ninja action. You can fiddle with these assists at any time in the menus, and switch between Hero, Normal and Hard difficulties through a playthrough, as you need.</p>
<p>Master Ninja difficulty, however, cannot be switched to or from mid-run. This means that it will remain the preserve of the ultra skilful diehards of the franchise.</p>
<p>Thankfully you will still have access to the training mode. This, possibly taking inspiration from fighting games – will let you drop into a training room to practice your attack strings and defensive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, and it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>Plus, Mech Zangie-F returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of her debut on <strong>15th October 2025</strong>, C. Viper gets the spotlight with a brand new gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <strong>Year 3 Ultimate / Character Pass</strong>, C. Viper (or Crimson Viper) was originally introduced to the series in the 2008 entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>. She retains her signature moves such as Burning Kick, Thunder Dash, Knuckled Pursuit, and Seismic Hammer. A brand new move called Focus Force has also been introduced, allowing you to bring up a protective barrier before launching your counterattack.</p>
<p>In addition to her standard outfit, C. Viper will also boast her Street Fighter IV attire for those who want to inject a bit of nostalgia into their gaming. As for the new outfit, Capcom has provided two pieces of artwork in its recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/544495527868235881">blog</a> to give you a good glimpse at Viper in all her glory.</p>
<figure><a title="C. Viper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c38f7ff28d0b/c-viper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In addition to a brand new character, the Year 3 Pass also introduces an extra outfit for Zangief. This is based directly on Mech Zangie-F from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>, though its overall design has been updated accordingly for this new release. It looks pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The additional outfit will be available on 15th October alongside C. Viper, but that's not all. Owners of the Year 3 Pass can also look forward to two addition characters in the coming months: Alex and Ingrid.</p>

However, they did give us a small tease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Showcases Multiplayer Maps Set in Japan</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature two maps set in Japan and they were both showcased during Xbox's TGS stream. Toshin was first up and it looks to be set in 2035 Tokyo. Furthermore, it will combine "well-defined lanes and some really fun set pieces - including a cat cafe, a karaoke bar, and a crashed train."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den is the second one and will offer a "different vibe." This map is set in the countryside outside Tokyo and "centers around a Japanese castle that's been repurposed as a Guild base."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be released on November 14, and the Early Access Beta will start on October 2 before the Open Beta kicks off on October 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan. For those unfamiliar, Chan has previously been seen in Eternals, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits," the official description reads of the brand-new character. "With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 Gameplay Overview Features Master Ninja Difficulty Action and Training Mode</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of its release on October 21, Ninja Gaiden took center stage at Xbox's TGS stream to showcase not only its training mode that will let you practice combos and weapons in a safe place, but also its Master Ninja mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlocked after beating Story Mode, Master Ninja will challenge players with feature late-game enemies in earlier chapters, enhanced AI, a greater number of enemies at once, and much more. For those looking for an even greater challenge, there is a setting called Death Wish mode where "growth elements are reset, and difficulty can be escalated towards an even harsher extreme." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Gets a Story Trailer, First Two Monster Hunter Stories Games Headed to Xbox in November</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new story trailer was revealed for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Reflection, and it was also revealed that the original Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin will be headed to Xbox Series X/S on November 14, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bruce Lee Is Joining Hitman: World of Assassination as Your Partner</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The legendary Bruce Lee is joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner "against the Dragon" later today. 47 will need to identify threats and protect Bruce Lee and work together with him to bring down this threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee will play a character named Agent Lee, a character trying to infiltrate the Concorn Union in Hong Kong.

"This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s Japan. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaHorizon6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ForzaHorizon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/D6HngHj43g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D6HngHj43g</a></p>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1971165411119943871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a> blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with art director Don Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise.

What's crucial about the patent is that it's&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;simply patenting summoning a creature into battle; for a game to be infringing, it would have to mimic the whole system, not just a part of it. Still, there's an anxiety to it all: Could Nintendo and The Pokémon Company come after other games with similar mechanics, as it has with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/production-collective-midnighters-launches-to-create-and-support-long-lasting-businesses-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Production collective Midnighters launches to 'create and support long-lasting businesses'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">René Otto,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://deviantlegal.com/about-us/">video game attorney and Deviant Legal founder</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, told Game Developer the patent doesn't necessarily mean Nintendo and The Pokémon Company now have a "monopoly on creature capturing and taming," or even auto-battling. "Instead, Nintendo has the exclusive right to use the combination of mechanics as described in the awarded patent for as long as the patent is deemed valid," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another question is whether or not the patent is valid—or, rather, whether it would hold up if challenged? The patent has already been awarded, and there's no undoing that without a legal challenge, which is unlikely, McLean said; it's expensive in both money and time to challenge a patent. But there's still debate as to whether it would hold up if challenged, centered around the idea of whether the patent covers an idea or not. You can't patent ideas, McLean noted. "There's so much case law trying to figure out whether a patent is an idea," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Nintendo and other large companies have very good lawyers who are very good at drafting ideas to sound like software.&quot;">"Nintendo and other large companies have very good lawyers who are very good at drafting ideas to sound like software."</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-claims-unknown-world-founders-stole-what-essentially-amounts-to-a-blueprint-for-subnautica-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton claims Unknown Worlds founders stole 'what essentially amounts to a blueprint for Subnautica'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patenting software makes things complicated.&nbsp;"It's very easy to talk about an idea that happens on software and make it sound like the software is new and useful and&nbsp;non-obvious," McLean continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But if you boil away all the software language, what the [United States Patent and Trademark Office] should be doing is saying, 'Is this an idea that happens on software, or is this software that executes an idea to the point that the software is the thing that's unique, non-obvious.'

There are hundreds of other patents—&nbsp;belonging to companies other than Nintendo—that exist in this complex space. "We're going to get to a point where developers are going to have to know about hundreds of patents to know if their specific systems—not just summoning, but tons of other things that are in games," she said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-applovin-leaders-establish-casual-mobile-studio-cheer" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former AppLovin leaders establish casual mobile studio Cheer</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The&nbsp;United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)&nbsp;is behind on games, McLean said.

		<p>Remasters come sooner every generation, it seems. Gungrave GORE Blood Heat has just been announced, a fully rebuilt version of Gungrave GORE.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gungrave GORE Blood Heat – Announce Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U90lcQ3_aHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blood Heat brings the game to a new engine – Unreal Engine 5 – with enhanced visual quality and modernised systems as well. Which is odd, because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE first launched in 2022</a> and was already on current generation consoles.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the game can’t be improved further. There’s new systems, more refined characters and background visuals, the return of heritage, exclusive new characters and more.</p>
<p>Gungrave GORE Blood Heat is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. Also Game Pass.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2022, we said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE,</a> “Gungrave G.O.R.E is a decent game. It’s not the best shooter, but it is often very entertaining if just for the spectacle. It has a few issues, mostly in level design, and the story isn’t particularly memorable, but there’s plenty of fun to be had in chainsawing your enemies with a transforming coffin.”</p>

            <p>After claiming they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-boasts-a-ring-of-instakill-dooooooooom-and-the-playtest-kicks-off-soon">invented "the most dangerous ring in gaming"</a> earlier this month, EA and DICE have released a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> campaign trailer that sees a soldier bloke deploy yet another 'the most something in something' line. Yep, amid a bunch of the usual militarying about, a man teases a battle over "the most strategic rock in the history of warfare".</p>
<p>Maybe it's just because there was far less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">helicopter boomage</a> in this look at the conflict between Dagger 13 and evil private goons Pax Armata, but the line's struck me. Stop shouting about the CIA for five minutes, Battlefield trailerfolk, we need to delve into rock history.</p>

<p>First of all, the trailer's above if you want to give it a watch. The line about strategic rocks comes at around the 40 second mark, with private military corp Pax Armata seemigly on the verge of securing this most strategic of stones. Naturally, you and your buddies "elite Marine Raiders unit" Dagger 13 can't be having that, hence the next line being "Want to help our friends take back this rock?". </p><p>Does history have enough strategic - or strategically significant to be gramatically correct - warfare rocks for it be worth crowning one king, I found myself asking, responding to a question with a question in a fashion that'd definitely get me kicked out of Dagger 13. Having racked my brain for five seconds, these are the ones I've come up with, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gibraltar, which is the site of the rock being teased here. It has plenty of strategical warfare history, having been the <a href="https://www.gibmuseum.gi/our-history/military-history/great-siege-of-gibraltar">site of a great siege</a> during the American Revolutionary War and played a role in World War 2. Control over it's also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-39478176">long been disputed between the UK and Spain</a>, because colonialism.</li>
<li>Alcatraz, which plays a major strategical role in the 1996 Michael Bay film The Rock. Like this trailer, it involves a lot of military folks arguing. Sean Connery's also there.</li>
<li>Some rocks that stopped me reaching a city in time for it not to collapse into civil unrest in Civilization one time. Though my memory of that's hazy, I might just have deployed my response too late.</li>
</ul>
<p>In googling strategic war rocks, I've also uncovered <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/12/2/354/132286/Carbonate-rocks-and-American-Civil-War-infantry">this research article</a> about carbonate rocks and American Civil War infantry tactics, which could be very interesting or the driest thing I'll ever read.</p>
<p>Looping back to the video game, EA wrote in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/your-first-look-at-battlefield-6s-single-player-campaign/">PS blog</a> that during the campaign: "You’ll be able to command the rest of Dagger 13 to engage enemy forces as a group in order to suppress them as you reposition to snipe, flank them, or take out multiple foes with a well-thrown grenade. Additionally, as you step into the well-worn boots of different members of the squad, you’ll be able to take advantage of their respective abilities and talents to gain the upper hand when engaging the enemy." There's a rundown of all the squad members' names and bios in the post, if you fancy meeting them.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>

<p>Ready for your Asterism Voyage?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dragami Games has announced that its mecha strategy title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> will launch for Switch 2 on <strong>25th September</strong>. By Jove, that's today!</p>
<p>Relayer Advanced, which sees you assume the role of Starchildren in a battle against the alien Relayer, has already seen release on various other platforms since its debut back in 2022, and this snazzy new Switch 2 version comes complete with all previously released DLC and spin-off story content.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, the 'Advanced' version is a souped-up take of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/relayer">Relayer</a> from March 2022 (the Advanced rejig launched the following October), which sits with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/relayer/">a Metascore of 77</a>. So, if you like SRPGs featuring big robots leathering chunks out of each other in space (and let's face it, who doesn't?), then it seems there's gonna be plenty of faces to get busy leathering for you.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the game's PR blurb, plus some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will command the "Stellar Gear" unit that the Starchildren board and battle against the "Relayer" forces. On stage, players will lead their troops to victory by making full use of such strategic systems as "Hate," which quantifies how easily enemies target you, "Skills" specific to jobs and characters, "Backstab," which launches pincer attacks, and "Big Bang," a special move.</p>
<p>This is the complete version that includes the main game as well as all previously released DLC.</p>
<p>Command a unit of "Stella Gear," humanoid weapons created using the technology of an ancient galactic civilization, and defend Earth from invasion by the mysterious lifeforms known as "Relayer."</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 100 cutscenes that are played when units battle each other.</p>
<p>The stage maps are also rendered in high-quality full 3D.</p>
<p>There is also "Hate," which indicates how likely you are to be targeted by the enemy, a wide variety of skills, and special attacks such as the pincer attack "Backstab" and the special move "Big Bang."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as all of the above tweaks, the game also includes a full English dub alongside its Japanese vocals. Hooray!</p>
<p>There's no pricing on Nintendo's US site just yet, but in the UK it'll set you back £29.50.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima/" data-ref-id="5000-693126">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> is the next chapter in the HoYoverse, and we've recently gotten more details about what the game is going to be about. The Honkai franchise has always been known for its anime-style graphics, quick and fluid combat, and addictive gameplay that keeps players coming back for more with every new installment. While Honkai: Nexus Anima is keeping many of those same elements, the developers are also changing up the core gameplay loop in some significant ways. Of course, you can still expect a similar feeling as the four previous games, but Nexus Anima is breathing some fresh ideas into the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't know everything about the new Honkai title, we've seen plenty of gameplay and heard enough details to get a good idea of what it has in store for the community. Below, you can see everything that we currently know about Honkai: Nexus Anima, including its release date, trailers, gameplay, and all other details in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Honkai: Nexus Anima be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, a release date for Honkai: Nexus Anima has not been announced by the developers at miHoYo. The game was only just recently formally announced on August 28, 2025, with some official screenshots, trailers, and information coming with that announcement.</p><p dir="ltr">However, no release date has been offered just yet. According to some rumors and how the development of the game is going, though, it seems like early 2026 is the most likely release window for Honkai: Nexus Anima at this time. Take that with a grain of salt, of course, as things can change drastically and we still don't know anything concrete.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Honkai: Nexus Anima</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the best parts about most new Honkai titles is that they are all free-to-play. The most recent game in the series, Honkai: Star Rail, was free-to-play at its launch in 2023, and that hasn't changed since.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, no preorders are necessary for Honkai: Nexus Anima, as you won't actually be able to purchase the game. This also means there are likely no editions for the game either. However, the developers haven't officially confirmed the free-to-play nature of the game, so Nexus Anima having a price tag attached to it can't be ruled out just yet. It would be a major change for the franchise if the game wasn't free-to-play, though.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Honkai: Nexus Anima Trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, there are two Honkai: Nexus Anima trailers you can watch that both come directly from the developer. One is a trailer for the private gameplay test that began in September, and the other is a gameplay trailer that showcases some of the new elements in Nexus Anima. You can watch both of them below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FV_6jirKU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5FV_6jirKU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first trailer, titled "Nexus Bond Teaser: Side by Side," is more of a cinematic trailer than anything. It features some of the characters and Anima that you'll see throughout the game. However, it mainly showcases the world that you'll get to explore, and the graphics are certainly a major highlight.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the second trailer, titled "In-game footage from Honkai: Nexus Anima," this is where we get into actual gameplay. The trailer shows off some of the gameplay mechanics that are being introduced with the game, as well as more characters and Anima. There's a look at the flying mechanic, a full-length battle, character creation, and a broader view of the world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Both of these trailers were released when Nexus Anima was announced in late August, and it's not currently known when a new trailer could arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As of right now, we know for sure that Honkai: Nexus Anima will be releasing on PC, iOS, and Android devices. This is the same trend that recent Honkai games have followed, but Honkai: Star Rail also eventually came to PlayStation 5. This occurred roughly six months following the game's initial release date.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if the developers have a console release date in mind for Nexus Anima. If the developers are planning a PS5 or Xbox version, though, we'll likely hear about it closer to the game's actual release date. Even then, we can assume that a console port wouldn't arrive until after the game launches on its standard platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Not too much about the story of Honkai: Nexus Anima has been revealed just yet. However, we do know the game takes place in a seaside town with dense urban elements. You can travel through the metropolis or take a stroll with your Anima down one of the several beach boulevards. The map in Nexus Anima seems to be quite large, so there's no shortage of places to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll also meet a variety of characters throughout the world, and many of them can be interacted with by you or your Anima. The main characters in Nexus Anima don't have too many details around them just yet, as the developers are likely waiting to reveal more of the main story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At its core, Honkai: Nexus Anima is a "creature-collector" game, which is akin to something like Pokémon. Players can head out into a large, open world and collect different creatures that will then be added to their party. These creatures are called "Anima."</p><p dir="ltr">While you can battle with these Anima and face off against other NPCs, your Anima aren't solely meant for that purpose. They also have utility during exploration and other areas, making your priorities for capturing one different from what they might be in a game like Pokémon. For example, some Anima are efficient at cleaning up the streets of the city by picking up trash, while others can actually work in stores and interact with potential customers. You can also level up your Anima, who all start at level 10, through a star-based system. Anima are leveled up through experience in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to battling, though, Anima have unique combat roles. These are defined by the Anima's in-game "Trait," which tells you more about how they will battle. One example of a Trait is the Gladiator, which likely means an Anima is going to be more fierce in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">To further help out Anima and customize them, each one has three gear slots that can be filled with gear you find out in the open world. Some gear will be more tailored to certain types of Anima, so it might be crucial to seek out that specific gear if you want to use one Anima in particular.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of using Anima, you don't have a traditional party of these creatures like in other games of this nature. Instead, Honkai: Nexus Anima uses a deck-building system that allows you to customize a deck of your acquired Anima. When you head into battle, you'll roll out the deck you've assembled based on real-time elements. Your deck won't be randomly rolled, so you can pick and choose which Anima appear in a battle depending on external factors.</p><p dir="ltr">Battling follows an auto-chess system, but there are several other elements that come into play as well. When a battle begins, you'll send out your Anima, and an "Animaster" will provide a buff to your creatures as combat starts. You can also utilize the assistance slots on the battlefield, which can be used by both teams and offer support in the form of healing, extra damage, etc.</p>

            <p>Sega has revealed the post-launch roadmap for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, including last night's announcement that Mega Man will be joining next year as paid DLC.</p>
<p>Capcom's iconic hero will be joined by Proto Man too, plus there will be a Dr. Wily's Castle course and a vehicle inspired by canine companion Rush.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available in Q2 next year in the third patch of the game's Season Pass. That begins later this year with the addition of Minecraft and SpongeBob Squarepants, with Pac-Man to follow early next year.</p>

<p>Then, Q3 of 2026 will see the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> and anime Avatar Legends. Each Season Pass Content Pack includes playable characters, a new vehicle, a new track, emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a number of free updates adding new characters and more. Hatsune Miku and Sonic Prime characters are available at launch for Digital Deluxe owners. Then later this year Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from Like A Dragon will be added, along with another unknown character.</p>
<p>More free additions will arrive in each quarter next year. You can see the roadmap in the image below.</p>

<p>However, the back of the physical box includes artwork for Sega Saturn icon NiGHTS, with fans presuming the jester character will be one of the free characters coming to the game.</p>
<p>Who else do you hope to see join Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds?</p>

            <p>The next grand open-world setting for the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> game will be Japan, Microsoft has accidentally announced, and it will be released in 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement came via an Instagram post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/forzahorizonofficial/">the official Forza Horizon account</a>. This let slip, ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-live-watch-it-with-us">Tokyo Game Show 2025 Xbox briefing</a> today, that "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan. Coming 2026." The post has since been removed. Whoops!</p>

<p>The full announcement is expected to occur in the Xbox briefing that's only moments away - due to begin at 11am UK time. How much of the game we'll see, we don't yet know, nor how much of Japan it will allow us to explore.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was released four years ago now, in 2021, and this year debuted on PlayStation 5, in the spring. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNHhTNEVIUmNRc1d6dFJ3ZgEeNeEeu8Qu5tD-zcBwnMvjnEelfLbKhqomunPmhYChqepr7UZmU8nQvQuCyqw_aem_FMSnw25d-mSOyt9PPW3ayQ">Tom thinks it's one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>. Given that, the question of whether this new instalment could launch on PlayStation 5 is probably more "when?" rather than "if?". Or, "How long will Microsoft keep it exclusive to Xbox for?"</p>
