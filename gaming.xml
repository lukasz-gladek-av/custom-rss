			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-guide-how-to-get-your-custom-loadout">Battlefield REDSEC Guide - How to Get Your Custom Loadout</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Releases Xbox Publishing Guide Online for Free]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-publishing-guide-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-releases-xbox-publishing-guide-online-for-free.1354309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has dropped its Xbox Games Publishing Guide for everyone to see. The guide, which was strictly under NDAs and such, is now fully available, coincidentally around the Steam Machine’s reveal.</p>







<p>For many indie developers, Steam has been a beacon for those who want to publish their first title. Via SteamDirect, one can, realistically, make a game, submit it, and it’ll be on the gaming platform in a little over a month. However, for other companies like PlayStation and Nintendo, it can be a bit more trickier to do. However, one company that has been a bit hard to tackle for indies is Microsoft. Despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox program</a>, many games are just not releasing on the consoles, with many citing the difficult process. Now, in the advent of the Steam Machine, Microsoft has decided to pull back the curtain and make the once-hidden guide available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-makes-xbox-games-publishing-guide-available-for-everyone">Microsoft Makes Xbox Games Publishing Guide Available for Everyone</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/11/unlocking-access-to-game-publishing-documentation-for-all-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Game Dev Blog</a>, Senior Program Manager at ID@Xbox, Ed Stewart, announced that <strong>the official Xbox Games Publishing Guide</strong> is <strong>available for free</strong> to everyone. The guide can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/game-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> for those interested. Speaking on the opening, Stewart said the following,</p>



<p>“<strong>By opening our Game Publishing Documentation, we’re removing barriers to learning and making it easier for teams of all sizes to understand what it takes to ship a game on Xbox</strong>,” Ed Stewart says in the blog. “<strong>Whether you’re a first-time independent developer or a seasoned publisher, you can now browse the guide freely, share it with your team, and reference it throughout development.</strong>“</p>



<p>The move does take a page right out of Steam’s playbook, which couldn’t be more convenient. The PC-only company recently announced it’s taking on the console market with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Its console will be able to play Steam games from your PC onto the TV. Microsoft is aware of it, as Xbox’s Phil Spencer congratulated the team. Perhaps this is the company wanting to become Steam or like them. Seeing as it’s putting exclusives like Halo and Gears of War on different consoles, it could be the future for Xbox.</p>







<p>What do you think of Microsoft releasing its Xbox Games Publishing Guide? Do you think more indies will make it onto Xbox? Think Microsoft wants to be Steam? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently issued an update (21.0.0) for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2 console</a> that, in addition to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">some small changes</a>, has caused some third-party docks to stop working as intended. In the early weeks and months of the console’s availability this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">companies raced</a> to figure out the right commands, the right power draw, and the right chips to use in order to trick the Switch 2 into thinking it had connected to the real thing — Nintendo’s dock, which is included with every console. Now, some of them will have to figure out how to do it again.</p><p>You’re not alone if you think Nintendo did this on purpose. But did it? According to Nintendo, not exactly. Gaming site <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081"><em>Kotaku</em></a> published a new statement from the company that says it “does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility.” Read in one way, it seems like Nintendo didn’t intend to cause these issues with its latest update. Read another way, Nintendo has apparently established that there’s a legal and an illegal way to create a third-party Switch 2 dock, and a lot of the ones out there were made illegally, apparently.</p><p>The fact that some third-party Switch 2 docks still work makes this more confusing. I tried out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Viture’s Pro mobile dock</a> (one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">early third-party docks to provide Switch 2 support</a>), for use with its Pro XR glasses, and it just works fine with the same firmware that’s been on it since I started testing it months ago.</p><p>Without more details from Nintendo, it’s tough to know what this spells for the future. Are more docks on the dock chopping block? Is it reconfiguring its proprietary Switch 2 dock handshake to leave third-party dock makers in a constant scramble? Will it develop (or has it already developed) something similar to the Apple MFi certification program to let companies pay a fee to promise support out of the box with its locked-down port?</p><p>Whatever the answers are, Nintendo will naturally want to push consumers towards using its pricey dock, and push third-party companies away from trying to engineer duplicative gadgets at a fraction of the cost. That spells an interesting next couple of months for third-party makers, including the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price">Genki</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801096/you-can-leave-your-switch-2s-dock-at-home-with-this-40-charger">JSAUX</a>, which are both launching compact, power adapter-size docks later this year. Switch 2 support is on each of their feature lists, but we’ll see if it remains a selling point closer to their launches.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/821250/switch-2-update-third-party-dock-update-blocked]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheat-sheet-crafting-guns-ardb-wiki-2000644449</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-the-best-cheat-sheets-and-third-party-resources.1354291/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is dense. That happens to be part of why I love it so much. But there’s no way around it: There’s a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game, from craftable materials, to weapon mods, to the weapons themselves, not to mention quick use items and your augments and shields. It feels endless sometimes–especially given that we so often interface with them one item at a time while we pick ‘em outta random bins or lockers we’ve broken into, or scavenge them from the innards of mechanical menaces we’ve shot down (or biological ones).</p> <p>That’s where cheat sheets and other resources come in. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has been out for a couple of weeks and already there are a bunch of fantastic user-made tools out there.</p> <p>Whether your preference is for images, spreadsheets, or websites, I’ve tracked down a few impressive and wildly useful resources to help you break down the game. Some of these address very specific parts of the sandbox of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ toys, while others are more comprehensive. Let’s take a look.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders </i>Database: The GOAT</h2> <p>Let’s kick things off with what I think is currently the best third-party resource for looking up info and tracking your progress as you collect your way to supremacy. Enter <a href="https://ardb.tools/"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Database</a>. Ardb.tools really is a one-stop shop for details on just about any item, map, and even enemy you’d need information about. Looking for a specific resource? Each item gets its own page, complete with all the info you need including locations on each map where you might be likely to find it. You can also directly compare the stats of guns and their various upgrade tiers. It rocks.</p>

 <p>There’s not much else I can say about it other than to encourage you to head on over and start clicking around. The tricky thing with these websites is that they’re only as good as their information is relevant, and as a live-service game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a moving target for these kinds of projects. But for now at least,</p>

 <p>this is perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough third-party resource for <i>Arc Raiders</i> thus far, and I also think its UI is very well done. Bookmark it; let it live on a second screen, or use it on your smartphone.</p> <h2>A more comprehensive weapon breakdown</h2> <p>As I said in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">my weapons overview</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a tricky game to figure out metas for. There are so many ways to enter and leave a match, and so many ways to get into or out of trouble, that simple DPS or TTK stats only give you one part of the picture of an <i>Arc Raiders</i> gun battle.</p>

 <p>But if you want a deep dive, all the way down to headshot multipliers and how many shots it takes to kill someone, have a gander at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/4c1e78b900b3bf5d/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9253d3f8-679e-4b41-90be-f4f0e67f74f8%7D&amp;action=default&amp;redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0VmalRVNUtlWjBGTGtMNzA4T1pfZFBnQmtXbXRMNW52dS1NLUZvdllUdTRIWFE_ZT1zeVR6WGU&amp;slrid=f660d9a1-f07e-0000-17be-eeccdf68937c&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0lRRDQwMU9Tbm1kQlM1Qy05UERtZjNUNEFaRnByUy1aNzd2alBoYUwyRTd1QjEwP3J0aW1lPWNQemV1YlVqM2tn&amp;CID=e5a5ee82-eb40-4380-a467-656d8059d225&amp;_SRM=0:G:39">the Anvil Community’s Weapon Metrics spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>As an .xlsx, you can even download the <a href="http://spreadsheet.it/">spreadsheet</a>. Clearly, it will work better in Excel or Microsoft’s live office tools. I’ve been able to download it and add it to my Google Drive, and it seems to work alright. The tabs on the bottom of the page refer to shield strength, so it will recalculate TTKs based on what your target is potentially wearing.</p>

 <p>This information might be wildly subject to change given <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ live-service nature, but for now, it’s one of the only ways to drill down to specifics such as headshot multiplayers and specific numbers of shots-to-kill.</p> <h2>Just the crafting resources</h2> <p>Two resources stood out to me when considering a cheat sheet focused entirely on resources (in addition to the excellent PDF/PNG cheat sheet I shouted out in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">my inventory management guide</a>).</p>

 <p>First up is the humbly named “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">Scrap” Google spreadsheet</a>, created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">by Redditor s1munsayz</a>. This is a very simple spreadsheet laying out all of the crafting resources you can recover, with a simple layout of what they can be recycled/salvaged into. Resources like ARDB are amazing, but a straightforward spreadsheet is sometimes a better visual learning aid.</p> <p>Be sure to make your own copy in your Google Drive to use its search functions appropriately.</p> <p>I also want to shout out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otpx0o/inventory_manager_manage_your_inventory_easier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Redditor Legal_Squash_195’s</a> “Inventory Manager,” a standalone Python app you can <a href="https://github.com/dev-boog/Arc-Raiders-Inventory-Manager">download from Github</a>. You’ll need to have Python installed on your machine to get it to work, but it’s a handy app–and if you’re like me and enjoy a good standalone, community-created piece of software, Inventory Manager is pretty awesome.</p>

 <h2>Honorable mention: arcraiders.wiki</h2> <p>While I think ARDB takes the cake with its vast amount of options, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/">arcraiders.wiki</a> was an early resource for me and it remains a solid way to sort through and look up the nature of various crafting materials, weapons, enemies, and maps.</p> <hr> <p>Time will tell how useful these resources remain over time, especially as <i>Arc Raiders</i> continues to get updates and potential changes to its meta math under the hood. For now, bookmark, download, do whatever you need to, because having these resources at the ready dramatically improves the overall flow of a healthy session of <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p>

                <p>I've been an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arknights-endfield/" data-ref-id="5000-560807">Arknights: Endfield</a> fan since the first global technical test in January 2024. Its art style that blended anime with realism and similarities with RPGs I enjoyed like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-genshin-impact/2900-6419/" data-ref-id="2900-6419">Genshin Impact</a> convinced me to try it. In the process, I found an intriguing world with a layered combat system and building mechanics that set it apart from competitors. Now, with the game's latest build, developer Hypergryph has reforged and polished those systems to feel even snappier and more accessible than what I remember.</p><p>According to developer Hypergryph, the team has redone 80 to 90% of the cutscenes and dialogue, about 50% or so of the structure of the maps, and nearly 40 to 50% of the game's overall level design--a lot of the game I first played back in 2024 is just not there anymore. But, after previewing Arknights: Endfield again for over five hours ahead of the official beta's launch, I have no doubt I'd spend another 20 in this brave new world.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arknights: Endfield Technical Test Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>When I first booted up this new version of Arknights: Endfield, I was quickly reintroduced to the controls with an action-packed battlefield. The player character, the Endministrator (or just Endmin), harnesses the power of a resource called Originium, which they can use to attack during combat and create and repair Originium-based machines. Later, we learn that the Endmin was the leader of Endfield Industries and the creator behind many of the machines that they control. Perlica, the poster character for Arknights: Endfield, and Chen Qianyu, a counterpart of Ch'en (a popular operator from the original Arknights), come from the same faction.</p><p>The intro didn't have the kind of impact I hoped for with a frantic but mindless boss battle and heavy exposition that slowed down the pacing with multiple time skips that detailed what happened leading into Endfield's story. However, after the first 20 minutes or so, the story starts to pick up when Perlica joins the Endmin on their first mission.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602341" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602341"></a><figcaption>You play as the Endministrator, the amnesiac leader of Endfield Industries.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg"></figure><p>Arknights: Endfield is an open-world action RPG with building mechanics that encourage you to essentially build your own mining and transportation infrastructure. Combat-wise, you can deploy up to four characters at once and even fight alongside them on the field, but you can only control one character at a time. Each character has skills that you can use so long as you have skill points, which you charge up as you fight with actions like dealing damage and dodging. You can also take advantage of combo skills, which you can manually trigger with a button while using another character so long as the conditions are met.</p><p>During the first mission, a prompt to activate Perlica's combo skill appeared after the Endministrator temporarily stunned an enemy. While I could have timed skills one after the other in the original test to increase damage, being able to stack an attack on top of the other with a combo skill added an additional strategic layer to the combat system I already enjoyed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602332" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602332"></a><figcaption>Left to right: Andre, Chen Qianyu, Endministrator, Perlica.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg"></figure><h2>Making combat snappier than before</h2><p>Ryan, one of the co-founders of HyperGryph and lead designer on the original Arknights title, explained to me via a translator the changes his team made for the second beta like this shift in combat. As the lead designer on Arknights: Endfield, he mainly handles systems design and oversees all things design-related, including characters and environments.</p><p>"This [change to combat] is done mainly because we received feedback that certain players believe our combat may not be as smooth as they have wanted," Ryan told me. "Basic attacks, for example, may easily get interrupted and [break] their combos. So we've added dodge, and we've also made changes to basic combat. So right now, players should have a much smoother combat flow and combos."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602336"></a><figcaption>When an Assist Skill is available, your teammate's icon will pop up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg"></figure><p>Dodging works similarly to how it would in most action games, where pressing a button at just the right time evades damage. In Endfield, successful dodges also charge your skill point meter so that your characters can more frequently cast stronger attacks.</p><p>Dodging isn't the only way to charge your skill meter--landing basic attacks and stringing together combos can too. Before, the closest I could get to dodging was using the dash button to quickly move out of the way of an attack. A true dodge mechanic makes evading enemy attacks much smoother and erases some of the frustrations I had with combat back in 2024. The incentive to play more skillfully so that you can charge your skill meter is also a plus.</p><p>Combo skills also help recharge your skill points, but they are trickier to set up. Each character has a combo skill that depends on a specific trigger, and you may have to build your team around these triggers to maximize synergy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602343" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="2872" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602343"></a><figcaption>The dodge mechanic was one of the major upgrades from Beta Test I.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg"></figure><h2>An easier to understand factory system</h2><p>Ryan also led the revamp of Arknights: Endfield's signature factory system. I started playing with factory mechanics within the first 90 minutes or so of the preview, where I recovered an open field to use for the AIC--aka your main "power plant" hub. From here, I relearned how to set up machines to automatically convert ores into higher-quality materials for building. Arknights: Endfield incentivizes you to use this factory system to streamline farming, build convenient transportation points between your most visited areas, and even sell products later on.</p><p>Arknights: Endfield easily reminds me of existing gacha RPGs with its combat menu and character progression systems, but it's the only one within the genre that I could think of with the ability to craft and place structures across the map with some kind of utility behind them. While the AIC is confined to one area, you can build towers and ziplines across the map depending on where you want to direct power for your machines or build ziplines for easy transport. I built a machine to automatically harvest ores, a machine to transform stacks of ore into materials for new towers, and so on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602337" data-ratio="0.56260899895361" data-width="2867" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602337"></a><figcaption>The factory system includes many machines and power supply.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg"></figure><p>You might also need to use the factory system to solve environmental puzzles, which appealed to the problem solver in me. I found abandoned machines that needed a power source to be operated, for example, so I built relay towers between them and the AIC. Once the machines were powered, I could use them to open gates that had treasure locked behind them.</p><p>This latest beta holds your hand when it introduces the factory system with a tutorial that details explicit instructions throughout the process, which I appreciated when I needed to learn how to build again. Arknights: Endfield also now has a blueprint system that lets you copy others' factory system layouts, so that you don't need to build them yourself if you don't want to or can't figure out how to. Between the more detailed tutorial and new blueprint feature, the factory system is a lot more approachable than it was before.</p><p>"Some players feel that the factory system is a very daunting task, so they don't know how to get started with [it]," Ryan explained. "At the same time, some core players who are more familiar with the factory system feel that they need more space and playgrounds to try out more complex designs. Based on these above considerations, we thought of the blueprint [system] as a great solution, which can take care of the two issues that we mentioned earlier."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602338" data-ratio="0.56236933797909" data-width="2870" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602338"></a><figcaption>You can build ziplines almost anywhere you want.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg"></figure><h2>Sci-fi is more complicated than you think</h2><p>I asked Ryan what he thought was an important but underrated aspect of a game like Endfield that he didn't think players would notice right away. In response, he brought up Arknights: Endfield's concept designs in sci-fi.</p><p>"So, from a player's perspective, they may not find a lot of distinguishing differences [between genres]. But, in reality, when making a game, I think sci-fi concepts are a lot harder to make than fantasy ones. In terms of game designs, sci-fi is a bigger challenge because, from structural designs to designs of monsters and all sorts of in-game elements, having a sci-fi theme means all these designs have to have a certain sense of logic in them. They have to have a certain sense of reasonability in them compared to other concepts, and that means we have to put a lot of considerations into our concept designs. Maybe some players may not be able to see this or feel this immediately upon playing the game, but we believe having these elements and considerations in our game design will help us to produce more original work."</p><p>For those not familiar with the series, Arknights: Endfield takes place in the same universe as the Arknights tower defense mobile game in a future far, far away. Its futuristic setting features chrome-laden environments filled with buildings, machines, and structures (like shelters, farming plots, etc.) that imply the existence of a technologically and scientifically advanced society.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602024" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602024"></a><figcaption>Outside of Wuling City, the new map in Beta Test II.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg"></figure><p>Arknights: Endfield kicks off in a region called Valley IV, which looks like a tech center hit by an apocalypse. Machinery in these areas are rugged, but aspects of their design still point toward each of their original purpose--maybe mining or irrigation. In my last 90 or so minutes with Endfield, I also explored Wuling City, which was significantly redone between this test and the last. This area features tall buildings and bustling streets like a city, but also includes water-themed structures that match the environment around it.</p><p>Ryan estimates it would normally take between 20 to 30 hours to enter the Wuling area if you focused on story content, so don't expect to see it as soon as I did. Wuling City also draws inspiration from many of the Hypergryph devs' alma mater, the China Academy of Arts.</p><p>"Rather than duplicating a certain building per se, the entire map draws some inspiration from the China Academy of Arts. That may include structural references, but also certain designs are actually done by professors within the China Academy of Arts," Ryan said.</p><p>"I think you will find details and pieces all over the map that draws inspiration here and there, especially in [the city part of] Wuling City."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601988" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601988"></a><figcaption>Wuling City is inspired by the China Academy of Arts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2>It's never too late for this gacha</h2><p>Last but not least: the gacha. Arknights: Endfield is a free-to-play gacha RPG, just like Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. It features limited-time banners with an increased drop rate for the featured character and both 5-star and 6-star characters.</p><p>Unfortunately, the gacha system wasn't available for testing during the preview. So I asked Ryan what we should expect to see when that system goes online. He wasn't able to tell me the exact numbers for the pity system (the maximum number of times a player would need to exchange currency on the banner), but he did reveal that Arknights: Endfield doesn't simply copy paste the same system from games like Genshin Impact.</p><p>Usually, limited-time banners feature a character that you can only get for six or so weeks. When the banner ends, you need to wait for the character to come back during a rerun. Instead of only running characters for a limited time, Arknights: Endfield characters featured in limited-time banners will still be available indefinitely after their debut. However, the increased drop rate for a featured character will still only be available during the limited-time banner. They will essentially just become another character you can get on the standard banner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602342" data-ratio="0.56228253305498" data-width="2874" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602342"></a><figcaption>Perlica and Chen are your first two free-to-play characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg"></figure><p>"So, simply put, there will be two main pools for players to use: the basic one, and more of a time-limited one. But we have done changes so that characters that get their probabilities up in the limited pool, they're not going to disappear after the time of the event. They're still going to be there for a while for some players to catch up," he explained.</p><p>So far, Ryan has confirmed Perlica, Chen, and Wulfgard as the three free-to-play characters you can expect to see at this point in development. These three were a big help to me in the first beta, and the reworked kits for Perlica and Chen that I tried out were even more fluid than last time.</p><p>If you want to try the game for yourself, you can sign up for the second beta now from the <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arknights: Endfield official website</a>. Arknights: Endfield Beta II Test officially begins on November 28, 2025.</p><p>Arknights: Endfield is slated to release in early 2026 for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>

Activision gave GameSpot a very brief teaser of Season 1 content coming to Black Ops 7's campaign endgame. This includes a limited-time mode for Endgame, and while we don't have any major details, we can say some very massive fights will be taking place across the campaign's Avalon map.</p><p dir="ltr">We weren't able to capture the footage being shared with us, but the video showed players fighting a giant robot across Avalon in Black Ops 7's endgame. Activision also told us that players can get inside the robot, so it seems this is something you can hijack and take control of for your own use.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The zombie T-Rex featured as the boss fight in Black Ops 6's Shattered Veil map will also become a boss encounter on Avalon. The strategy for fighting this version of the T-Rex boss looks similar to doing so in Zombies mode, with players launching themselves onto its back to deal major melee damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only saw a glimpse of the Season 1 campaign content, but it definitely gives players something to look forward to in Endgame. Black Ops 7's endgame is playable by either completing the campaign to unlock it, or teaming up with another player who already has access to the mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/football-manager-2026-is-the-series">The Game Business</a> once again reveals the latest GSD sales data, and which games made the top-10 on Europe's sales charts for last week (November 2-9). While previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-back-in-top-spot-eu-sales-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-drops-to-third/">weeks have been dominated by Battlefield 6</a>, last week's sales tell a different story, with Football Manager 26 roaring into the top spot to knock Battlefield off, at least for a week.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled</a>, it was even more critical for SEGA and Sports Interactive that Football Manager 26 was a success, and so far, at least commercially, that's been the case. According to The Game Business, not only is this a big release for the Football Manager series, it's the biggest launch in the history of GSD releasing these weekly sales charts, a practice it started back in 2017.</p>



<p>That said, for all its commercial success, Football Manager 26 has not gone over well with players, with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/">player reviews categorized as 'Mostly Negative' on the game's Steam page</a>. Still, those negative reviews today won't change the fact that, at least for a week, Football Manager 26 sits at the top of the EU's sales charts in both units sold and revenue.</p>



<p>Despite being toppled, Battlefield 6 did not fall too far down the list, remaining in the top three at the number two spot for both revenue and units sold. It's followed by EA Sports FC 26, which has also been one of the leading titles in recent weeks, followed by Pokémon Legends Z-A and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment in fourth and fifth place, respectively, on the units sold chart. On the revenue chart, they swap places, with Pokémon in fifth place and Hyrule Warriors in fourth.</p>



<p>Other notable entries in the top-10 lists include Ghost of Yotei, which came in at the eighth spot for units sold and the sixth spot for revenue, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which made the units sold list in ninth place and the revenue list in seventh. </p>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei continues to ride the wave of its first month and a half on the market, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 re-enters the charts <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">thanks to a mixture of a free trial weekend where players on Steam and Xbox could try the game for free</a>, and get the game at a discounted price with all of their progress made in the free trial carrying over. The free weekend and discount were also timed with the release of the game's third and final DLC expansion, which drew even more players back to it after it launched at the start of this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-10 games in the EU for units sold for last week (November 2-9):</p>

<li>Football Manager 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>

<p>It’s been a packed week in the gaming industry, and if you’re trying to catch up on the gaming news you may have missed, Insider Gaming’s got everything covered. Battlefield 6 led the way with major updates on new post-launch modes and fixes for REDSEC and weapon bloom coming next week. Ubisoft, meanwhile, caused confusion after halting share trading and delaying its earnings report just minutes before release, all while quietly working on a new multiplayer shooter behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, PlayStation signaled that the PlayStation 5 (PS5) is only halfway through its lifecycle, the United Football League (UFL) is exploring the potential of becoming an officially licensed football video game, and it was revealed that God of War developer Sony Santa Monica had a new IP canceled despite more than $25 million invested into the project.</p>



<p>Here’s your full Insider Gaming recap of the biggest stories you may have missed this week.</p>

All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new. The press release includes some basic information about each of the drops, titled respectively The Hunt, The Hunters, The Monsters, and The Monsters II, but no card images as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunt</strong> focuses on non-creature spells, themed around "the terrifying attacks that monsters across the Monster Hunter franchise can unleash." There is one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Blind Obedience: Malzeno from <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em></li><li>1x Snap: Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Village Rites: Magnamalo and Tobi-Kadachi from <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></li><li>1x Mizzium Mortars: Yian Garuga from <em>Monster Hunter Generations</em> and <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Tooth and Nail: Azure Rathalos and Seregios from <em>Monster Hunter 4</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunters</strong> is, as it sounds, about the hunters themselves, with each card depicting a different set of armor and weapons and having the human creature subtype. As before, there's one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Grand Abolisher: Tigrex Armor with Bone Scythes from Monster Hunter Generations and Monster Hunter Freedom 2</li><li>1x Archaeomancer: Velkhana Armor with Slinger and Winged Seraphyd Greatsword from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>1x Grim Haruspex: Nargacuga Armor with a Hidden Eye Light Bowgun from Monster Hunter P2G/MHFU</li><li>1x Imperial Recruiter: Rathalos Armor with Red Tigrex Claws; Brachydios Armor with Burning Knocker; Gore Malaga Armor and Royal Rose from Monster Hunter 4G</li><li>1x Champion of Lambholt: Astalos Armor with Verdant Lightning Shield from Monster Hunter Generations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Monsters </strong>and <strong>The Monsters II</strong> are similarly self-explanatory, including the following monsters as legendary creatures. These are two different sets, but the press release is unclear exactly how these nine creatures will be split between them. IGN has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment on this and just generally on the confusing nature of this press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nezahal, Primal Tide: Lagiacrus from Monster Hunter 3</li><li>Drakuseth, Maw of Flames: Rathalos from Monster Hunter Generations</li><li>Sarulf, Realm Eater: Zinogre from Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</li><li>Vaevictis Asmadi, the Dire: Nergigante from Monster Hunter World</li><li>Ziatora, the Incinerator: Fatalis from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Razaketh, the Foulblooded: The Gore Malaga from Monster Hunter 4</li><li>Amareth, the Lustrous: Velkhana from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Wasitora, Nekorus Queen: Nargacuga from Monster Hunter Portable 2nd Generation/Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</li><li>Kalamax, the Stormsire: Brachydios from Monster Hunter 3 Generations</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box - Magic: The Gathering</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for both Secret Lair and third-party Magic collabs in general, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">some incredible Secret Lair card drops</a> including Sonic, Final Fantasy, Deadpool, SpongeBob, The Office and more. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">We're currently eagerly awaiting</a> the release of the Avatar: The Last Airbender Universes Beyond set, following close on the heels of Marvel's Spider-Man. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2026">Next year is looking equally stacked</a>, with planned Universes Beyond sets featuring TMNT, The Hobbit, Marvel, and Star Trek.

<figure data-uuid="554a4ad31a9c9"><a title="Riffmaster review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/554a4ad31a9c9/riffmaster-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/pdp-riffmaster-guitar-xbox-a-fun-option-for-rock-band-fortnite-festival-and-beyond">PDP Riffmaster</a> was first released back in April 2024, and it's a wireless guitar controller that's reviewed well, even if it is a little on the pricey side at the £130/$150 mark.</p>
<p>We've already looked at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-x-gibson-guitar-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-great-quality-at-a-price">CRKD x Gibson Guitar Controller</a>, which costs slightly less and does a very nice job of handling... well, there aren't actually that many games to play with guitar controllers on Switch consoles just now, so you're gonna have to settle for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a> with this new one, basically.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that the Riffmaster is designed specifically for this use case (although, of course, defeating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> with a guitar <em>is</em> what you came for). It's PDP's first guitar peripheral since 2015, when they released a Fender Jaguar-styled model for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a>. You know, back when everybody's home was filled with plastic guitars for the post-pub ritual of 'being better than your mates at pretending you're able to play a guitar'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067isjwxz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Okay, there's far more to it than that; it's a skilful pursuit, is perfecting the trickiest of rhythm game tracks, and something that I personally spent a lot of time (a shameful amount of time) enjoying back in the days when I could still feel pleasure. So, after an initial release that didn't see Nintendo consoles included, here we have a dedicated Switch model and, I'm pleased to say, it makes a solid impression.</p>

<p>Admittedly, being offered a guitar peripheral to review for Switch wasn't really on my radar when this one showed up. I'd given up on my love of all things <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock">Guitar Hero</a>-related, and my collection of plastic instruments (you better believe I've had a lot of drum kits and guitars and DJ decks through my house) has long since departed to that great big <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CEX</a> in the sky. So, what's it like to re-involve oneself through the PDP Riffmaster?</p>
<p>Well, if it had more games specifically for it — if I could plug it in (you don't even need a dongle, you just sync 'n' stroke) and get wellied into a load of my favourite tunes — I'd be having a great time, I'm sure. However, Fortnite Festival isn't great in all honesty, and it can be a frustratingly menu-heavy experience for those who aren't regular Fortnite players.</p>
<p>However, I'm here to review the guitar, not Epic's money-vacuum, and the Riffmaster is a delightfully light (just 1.570 grams, apparently), quiet, and easy-to-use guitar controller that improves on that 2015 model I mentioned in meaningful ways. Its buttons are laid out in a better arrangement, it's got a dedicated screenshot button so you can take pictures of the Fortnite menus, and it cleverly makes it easier to avoid erroneous inputs as you rock out.</p>

<p>Its strut bar is completely silent, making for a great way to stealthily jam with a pair of headphones in place, and it also stores away easily thanks to a foldable neck that doesn't trade build quality for ease of use. Simply lift up the little switch on the back of the neck to either flip the neck up or down. It clicks satisfyingly into place and never feels like it's wobbling or otherwise insecure as you play. Thusly, we are straight away in brownie points territory, as having big plastic guitars around your gaff can get untidy, and I appreciate this is easy to tuck out of sight. Even the box is surprisingly small.</p>
<p>The head can be fully removed, too, if needed, but the rest of the model is one piece, and this adds to an overall feeling of quality in the build. There's no noticeable squeaking, or movement of parts as you play, the fret buttons that sit on the top and lower portions of the neck feel responsive, and it wasn't too long (even with the game's UI) before I was failing miserably at all of the tracks included in Fortnite Festival - which does seem to be loads. At least they got that bit right.</p>
<p>Now, my favourite part of all of this is that the strut bar is totally silent and doesn't do any infuriating clicking and/or clacking as it moves. I hate that. I have always found it very distracting over the music (on older guitars, you could even hear it when the sound was full blast), and I'm grateful that it's been removed.</p>
<p>This smoothness continues into the fret buttons, as they feel light, responsive, and easy to release. There's no clickiness or feedback of any other type to distract you as you move between notes. It feels like a high-end version of what I remember playing years ago. Which, at this price point, is what you'd expect!</p>

<p>Am I any better at playing the songs as a result? No. But it feels as though it's easier to move across the fret buttons quickly, so it's unlikely that's the guitar's fault. Oh, and the range, which is apparently 30 feet of low-latency goodness, has impressed me as I've walked out to the kitchen for a snack midway through Soundgarden's <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg">Black Hole Sun</a></strong> (space stuff makes me hungry) and it didn't lose connection.</p>
<p>In terms of the overall design, it's very similar to the PDP Fender, but here they've exaggerated the lower left side so it looks 70% more like it belongs to a guitarist in a sci-fi movie band. I like it. It looks good. However, it does create a little bit of an issue with the included strap, as the connection point is tucked in beside the resultant groove along the bottom, and the strap gets a little stuck in around the USB-C port. Not a biggie, but something to note.</p>
<p>It's a very shiny guitar, too, so you're mileage may vary if you hate fingerprints - really shows every last mark and smudge. You can take off the face plate if desired, so there's the possibility to customise it a little. You know, maybe add a little Nintendo Life logo, or what have you. Oh, and isn't it amazing to no longer need a ton of batteries for these things? This model lasts for around 30 hours on a full charge.</p>
<figure data-uuid="281652cfc73c9"><a title="Riffmaster review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/281652cfc73c9/riffmaster-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, then, the PDP Riffmaster is a cracking bit of kit. It's got me missing proper sessions on dedicated games. The only real criticism I have is that the price is hard to justify on Switch given the lack of games. Fortnite Festival will do — and I'm sure you know what you're getting into if you're considering a purchase anyway — but damn, it'd sure be nice to try this thing out on some proper games and with some proper local co-op action on the go, because everything about it feels great.</p>
<p>If you're in the market for a guitar controller for your Switch or Switch 2, and the CRKD isn't quite your scene, beyond a slight niggle with the guitar's strap not quite agreeing with the body shape, everything else here is sick, streamlined, and easy to get jamming with. Now, bring on the rhythm game resurgence!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">AdHoc Studio's debut project, Dispatch,</a> has become one of 2025's late entries into the game of the year conversation based on the way it's been received online by players and critics alike. The studio, which was founded by former Telltale developers, has taken a long, winding journey <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077">to get to the point where Dispatch is out and has sold over 1 million copies</a>. A journey that, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo">according to a new report</a>, included a stint at Ubisoft San Francisco, and how a new Splinter Cell game was eventually crushed under Ubisoft executives pushing for a games-as-a-service (GaaS) money-making game, which would become XDefiant.</p>



<p>It's a bit of a wild story, which is why it's not surprising that the reveal comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, a reporter who has essentially made a career out of telling some of the video game industry's most wild stories across all of his articles and his three books.</p>







<p>Nick Herman, co-founder of AdHoc, confirmed that after he and some of his fellow former Telltale cohorts left Telltale Games in 2017, <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">which was just before the studio would close</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">though it was later revived</a>), they joined Ubisoft San Francisco. At the time, the studio was working on a new Splinter Cell game, and Herman was excited for the work he was doing each day.</p>



<p>"<em>I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while, and we thought we could tell a great story and do something the</em> <em>fans would love</em>," Herman said. Unfortunately, those feelings were eventually dashed, as the report explains that Ubisoft executives, who were (and probably still are) obsessed with getting a giant GaaS game in the company's portfolio, pressured development teams across the company to find a way to make their projects games-as-a-service games.</p>



<p>"<em>We tried</em>," Herman began. "<em>'Let's make a narrative GaaS game.' We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.</em>" Nothing was able to go the distance, however, and soon after, Herman understood that Ubisoft was not interested in making the kind of game he was interested in making.</p>



<p>"<em>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great. And then you realize that all the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games</em>."</p>



<p>Herman and the rest of his former Telltale team members, who joined Ubisoft in 2017, would leave to start AdHoc in 2018 when the opportunity came, but the project that they left would grow to become XDefiant. According to the report, Ubisoft San Francisco started to focus more on wanting to make something to challenge Call of Duty, which is essentially what XDefiant was trying to do with its approach to multiplayer FPS gameplay.</p>



<p>So while Herman and his colleagues would go on to start AdHoc and eventually make Dispatch, under the stewardship of the same executive class that killed what is likely just one of many attempts at a new Splinter Cell game that've been crushed over the years, Ubisoft San Francisco went on to make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">a free-to-play multiplayer game that was shut down a year after it came out</a>. Ubisoft San Francisco was also shut down as a result. A classic masterful gambit from Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Regarding new Splinter Cell games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">we know the team at Ubisoft Toronto is currently leading development on a remake of the first game</a>, but we've not had an update on that project for a while now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a> undoubtedly raised numerous questions for both fans of the franchise and the genre. How will it work, exactly? The games were single player only, except for the kid-friendly spin-off LEGO Horizon Adventures. Thankfully, IGN was able to obtain some answers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Executive Producer Sunggu Lee</a>. To start, Lee admitted that the co-op hunting action featured in CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series was a heavy inspiration for Steel Frontiers:</p>



<p><em>Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon’s core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point. From the very beginning, combining Horizon’s rich world with the hunting-action genre just made sense. And when you add Horizon’s unique machine ecosystem, the part-breaking mechanics, and its deep storytelling, you get something that feels truly distinctive—an experience that’s uniquely Steel Frontiers.</em></p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers is going to be an MMORPG set in the world originally created by Guerrilla Games. As such, it's no big surprise that Lee mentions towns and guilds as key systems in the game:</p>



<p><em>In Horizon Steel Frontiers, towns and guilds are really the heart of the community. Towns act as central hubs where players gather, prepare for hunts, and naturally connect with others. Out in the field, you might team up spontaneously with players you meet, or join forces in planned, strategic co-op play to take down tougher machines. These moments — whether unexpected or carefully coordinated — help strengthen bonds between players. And of course, we support all the core social features you’d expect from an MMORPG, like friends lists, chat, and party systems, so players can communicate and collaborate seamlessly.</em></p>



<p>The Executive Producer also discussed the changes to the combat system. Whereas Guerrilla's single player games are notoriously centered on ranged combat, the gameplay footage already showed that this will be a lot more melee-focused, and players will have to decide when to dodge and when to attack the machines. As an MMORPG, the game will support small parties to mid-sized raids, because truly large-scale raids would be confusing with this type of combat.</p>



<p>Despite Guerrilla promising some competition between tribes in the announcement video, Sunggu Lee says that the core content's focus is on PvE elements. No comment was made regarding the possible inclusion of Aloy or other characters. On the other hand, Lee confirmed that the game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Decima Engine.</p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is targeting a late 2026/early 2027 launch window</a> on PC and mobile, although NCSOFT is hoping to get Guerrilla (and Sony) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to agree to port the game to PlayStation 5</a>, too. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-easier-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade.1354222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played Escape from Tarkov from a fresh, uninitiated perspective, you’ll know that it’s <strong>not </strong>a welcoming game. It’s one of the most challenging shooters ever developed, and fans of the spearhead extraction title love to lord it over other gamers when they become <strong>cracked </strong>at Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>As the game hits 1.0 tomorrow, Battlestate Games is planning something that will, for the first time in a decade, make Escape from Tarkov <strong>easier for new players to understand</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-a-tutorial">Escape from Tarkov is Getting a <em>Tutorial</em></h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been pretty rough for years. You buy it, create a basic character, and are thrown into the game to figure out for yourself how the core mechanics work. The first tasks put to you are simple, but you have zero guidance, no map markers, and little in the way of any indication of where to go.</p>



<p>The game’s core mechanics were never explained, tactics were never outlined, and functions like healing, inventory management, and weapon handling were left up to the player to discover and master.</p>



<p>That’s why it comes as a surprise to learn what Escape from Tarkov has planned for the 1.0 release, which is dropping tomorrow after more than a decade of development.</p>



<p>When new players enter the fight in Escape from Tarkov from tomorrow, they’ll be met <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with a <strong>tutorial</strong></a> designed to help them learn the ropes. But it doesn’t end there. Beyond the tutorial, Battlestate Games has outlined step-by-step progression guides, building on the scattering of guides it introduced over the last year or so.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has never had a strict tutorial, only ‘more basic’ starter missions that were designed to ease players into the brutal game world, but even they were often sticking points early on in every ‘reset’ (read: wipe).</p>







<p>The tutorial arrives with a non-linear story campaign and end-game content, a new map, new mechanics and weapons, improvements across the audio and graphics suite in the game, and <strong>more than 1,000 improvements </strong>across the board.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about Tarkov 1.0.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success.</p><p>"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while," Herman said told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love."</p><p>The game was in development "for a few months," Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.</p><p>"We tried," Herman said. "Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made."</p><p>The report said "Ubisoft had lost interest" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shut down after a year and developers were laid off. </a></p><p>"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great," Herman said. "And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore.

Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season.

Neither the original PlayStation release of Dragon Quest VII nor the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-fragments-of-the-forgotten-past">2016 3DS remake</a> featured voice acting, so I asked Reimagined lead scenario writer if this changed how the team approached redesigning the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it did.&nbsp;</p><p>"Knowing that it was going to have voice over certainly did change the approach of the way I wrote the narrative here," Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya offices in Tokyo, Japan. “The original release on PlayStation didn’t have any voiceovers, and it was written [out]. So certainly, the way we wrote the language of the dialogue [in Reimagined] needed to be changed to be more realistic and more modern for modern audiences.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She says colloquialism played a significant factor in writing Reimagined’s dialogue, because everything needs to sound natural for the various included voice-over options.</p><p>I hear first-hand one of these changes when I encounter eventual party member Sir Mervyn at the top of The Tallest Tower dungeon while playing the game. After I awaken him from a special stone to defeat the flying Chimaera surrounding the tower, he does just that before gracefully landing beside my party. It's here I hear his voice, and it sounds like that of a medieval knight – this isn't too shocking, considering how he looks.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Sir Mervyn</p>
  
</article>

<p>But in Japanese, he talks like a feudal samurai, Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/who-is-takeshi-ichikawa-the-producer-of-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">who you can read more about here</a>, says. Another example of this colloquialist effect present in Reimagined comes from Bulgio, an extremely wealthy man who gives Hero the special stone that houses Sir Mervyn. In English, Bulgio mixes Italian words into his English, reflecting the multicultural inspiration present throughout the world of Reimagined. In Japanese, however, that's not the case – instead of mixing English and Italian, his dialogue instead reflects his character rather than a nationality.&nbsp;</p><p>"He's supposed to be this rich, arrogant guy, and that's reflected in the dialogue," Takagi says on the differences between the Japanese localization and the English version, noting her work is focused on the former while other teams handle the latter. "At least for the Japanese version, we didn't necessarily write dialogue in a way that you can tell what these specific cultural backgrounds are for each character, but we did write dialogue in a way that it's immediately understandable what kind of personality that character has."&nbsp;</p><p>Takagi adds, "The world of Dragon Quest VII, as you know, is comprised of many different islands, and obviously the dialects on each of those islands tends to differ, so it is a very important part of the story of Dragon Quest VII to ensure that the residents of those islands can reflect the uniqueness and individuality of each of those islands and the cultures they have."&nbsp;</p><p>We'll get to hear more of these new voices when Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.

              <p data-component="paragraph">In 2017, some former Telltale developers were working on a <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel that eventually, due to Ubisoft’s focus on live-service games, morphed into the now-dead free-to-play FPS<em> XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">In a <em>Bloomberg</em> story published on November 14</a> about the development of the recently released narrative-focused superhero adventure game <em>Dispatch</em>, we learn a little bit about a previously unknown-to-the-public <em>Splinter Cell</em> game that was being developed by Ubisoft San Francisco around eight years ago.</p> <p data-component="paragraph">Adhoc Co-Founder Nick Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em> that in early 2017, he and a few colleagues left Telltale after working on <em>Tales from the Borderlands</em> and landed at Ubisoft San Francisco. They were tasked with developing a new entry in the tactical stealth franchise, <em>Splinter Cell.</em> At that point, it had been about four years since the last game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-the-kotaku-review-1126859452"><em>Blacklist</em>, had been released in 2013</a>.</p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told the outlet. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p> <p data-component="paragraph">However, after working on the new <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel for a few months, Ubisoft executives started disrupting development. This was when the publisher was becoming more and more focused on live-service games that could be updated for years and years, like <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>and <em>The Division 2. </em>Ubisoft reportedly wanted all of its in-development games to include live-service elements and monetization, including the new <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“We tried,” Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Let’s make a narrative [live-service] game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.” But it apparently became clear to those working on the doomed game that Ubisoft was no longer interested in <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em>According to<em> Bloomberg</em> and Herman, the project changed and evolved many times, and eventually became <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899"><em>XDefiant,</em> aka that short-lived live-service shooter Ubisoft killed back in June.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>“It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” Herman said. “And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</p> <p>Ubisoft hasn’t completely given up on <em>Splinter Cell. </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-splinter-cell-trailer-netflix-deathwatch-chaos-theory-ending-john-wick-2000626077">There’s an animated series that recently arrived on Netflix</a> that I’m guessing you didn’t know about. And <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">in 2021, the company confirmed Ubisoft Toronto was developing a remake</a> of the first game. We’ve not heard much about that project since it was first revealed. Hopefully, it doesn’t morph into some <em>Call of Duty</em> clone.</p>

<p>More importantly, the company claimed that it "does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility." It is unclear what Nintendo considers to be a "legal" dock.</p><p>When version 21.0.0 arrived on November 11, some Switch 2 owners took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> and other forums to share their struggles with using third-party docks after the patch. Other users have noted that their docks remain functional, and manufacturers such as <a href="https://hagibis.bbscloud.com/info/570fc56f2e5c480cbda88a6638ebed89?csr=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hagibis</a> and <a href="https://support.jemdogame.com/firmware_update_dock_20251112/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jemdo</a> have since deployed firmware updates to their docks to ensure compatibility with the latest Switch patch.</p><p>Regardless of Nintendo's intention, the sample size of users who experienced issues with their third-party docks certainly demonstrates that the latest Switch firmware update had some sort of impact on compatibility. Based on Nintendo's statement, it doesn't appear that the company is eager to remedy the situation, and it may fall on the dock makers themselves to push out their own fixes.</p><p>Switch owners may own a third-party dock for various reasons, including the desire to have docks in multiple locations within their home or for portability. Unfortunately for third-party hardware makers, Nintendo made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2's USB-C port a lot more restrictive</a> and harder to work with.</p><p>Many third-party Switch 2 docks found online range from $20 to $50. In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-dock-set-123791/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's official Switch 2 dock set</a>, which include the official dock, an ultra-high-speed HDMI cable, a USB-C cable, and an AC adapter, costs $125 USD.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, AdHoc Studio co-founder Nick Herman spoke about how Dispatch came to be and an interesting situation that led to the studio’s formation.</p>







<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>



<p><strong>“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,”</strong> Herman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told Schreier</a>. <strong>“And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</strong></p>











<p>Unfortunately, the game didn’t get very far. After just months of work, Ubisoft started making pivots on its plans. It seemed like the writing was on the wall for the game. </p>



<p>“<strong>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” </strong>Herman said. <strong>“And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</strong></p>







<p>Herman, Shorette, and Lenart would leave Ubisoft after the project was cancelled and form AdHoc Studio along with Michael Choung in 2018. </p>



<p>Despite no new game in the franchise since Splinter Cell: Blacklist in 2013, Splinter Cell isn’t dead. Ubisoft is currently working on a remake of the original game that, as of late 2024, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still planned for a 2026 release</a>. Since then, however, it’s been quite silent on its status. </p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has moved into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with Tencent</a>, started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new subsidiary</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-delays-earnings-report-halts-share-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed reporting its earnings</a> just minutes before they were scheduled to release.</p>

                <p>The story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a> is a cautionary tale in the age of live-service games. Years of development and millions of dollars went into the game, only for it to fail at launch and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">get canceled by Sony weeks later</a>.

The team shared a pair of a gameplay videos to demonstrate their achievement, but noted that Concord is still somewhat buggy.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahpUW5Gbfi0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahpUW5Gbfi0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trio successfully tested their ability to load the game, pick their characters, and run a full Clash Point match.</p><p>"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy," wrote Red.

<p>Was due in November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7693829e5141b"><a title="Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7693829e5141b/lollipop-chainsaw-repop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dragami Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans of extremely bloody, sugary sweet violence were likely excited to get their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-is-getting-a-sweet-switch-2-edition-upgrade-this-november">this month</a>. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a little bit longer, as Dragami Games have announced a last-minute delay. The game will now be launching in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>But there's actually a good reason for the delay this time around — "While the title was initially planned to be released as a digital-only version, we received many requests for a physical edition following the announcement" the developer states <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413">on social media</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067isjwxz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>"In response, and with the cooperation of multiple publishing partners, we are now able to prepare physical releases for multiple regions." The delay is to allow both the digital and physical versions to release at the same time.</p>

<p>So, we think we can all wait just a few more months to get the game on a cartridge, right? At least, we assume it'll be a full physical release.</p>
<p>We hope the Switch 2 Edition improves some of our issues with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lollipop_chainsaw_repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a> on the Switch, which suffered from rough performance. It's not the <em>best</em> game in the world, but it's a cult hit with many, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lollipop-chainsaw-repop">we were disappointed with the rerelease</a>.</p>

		<p>Amazon had dropped a new trailer for season two of Fallout, based on the Bethesda franchise of the same name.&nbsp; We get to see more Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) as they travel to&nbsp; New Vegas, plus our first look at two of the new additions to the cast,&nbsp; Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani.</p>
<p>The Fallout Season 2 trailer also reveals Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.<br>
Fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, Barb Howard, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, is also shown a long with other returning characters such as Woody Thomas (Zach Cherry) and Lucy’s dad, Overseer Hank MacLean who is played by Kyle MacLachlan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout Season Two | Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dS6q36IyKpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Amazon previously announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, which was commissioned just a week after the first had aired.</p>
<p>The logline for season two does not reveal anything,&nbsp; “The new season will pick up in the aftermath of season one’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas.”</p>

<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue. The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>
<p>The first episode of Fallout Season 2 will be released on Amazon Prime video on 17th December 2025, with a new episode following on the same day for the next seven weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98we-are-aware-of-our-significance-and-we-have-very-big-plans%E2%80%99.1354159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Saturday isn't usually a day of game releases, and yet it is the day that developer Battlestate Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has chosen to release version 1.0 of its highly popular game Escape from Tarkov</a>. Tomorrow, the game will officially exit early access and become available for the first time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, Valve's premier global PC gaming platform.</p>



<p>We first covered the game over nine years ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-tarkov-interview-truly-hardcore-first-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an interview conducted at Gamescom 2016</a>. The game then followed an unusual development pattern: Battlestate <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-closed-beta-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soft-launched it with the Closed Beta</a>, which became available on July 28, 2017, granting access to all pre-order customers and dropping the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) so that players could freely discuss the game on the Internet.</p>



<p>Since then, the studio slowly but surely expanded and improved the game, which gained a large following of players and became the de facto ancestor of a new shooter subgenre: the extraction shooter, where players enter a zone, scavenge it for loot, and fight against AI and player-controlled enemies in a dangerous bid to extract with those precious resources intact.</p>



<p>This type of game is so popular nowadays that its mechanics are even spilling into other genres, as we're seeing with extraction RPGs like <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Pantheon</a> (now known as Gods, Death &amp; Reapers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mistfall Hunter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-veteran-finds-funding-innsmouth-mysteries-lovecraft-co-op-extraction-rpg/">Innsmouth Mysteries</a>, just to name a few.</p>



<p>Still, Escape from Tarkov remains as alluring as ever with its hardcore, realistic, and uncompromising extraction military first-person shooter experience. With mere hours left separating us from the long-awaited 1.0 release, here's our exclusive chat with Game Director Nikita Buyanov, in which we discussed the road to launch, what's in it (and what's not), the studio's opinion on the burgeoning genre, and what's next for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It's been over 8 years since you first released Escape from Tarkov to pre-order players. How would you describe this long journey with your community?</strong></p>



<p>This wasn't just a long journey; it's been a part of our lives—mine and everyone at the studio. We grew up ourselves, and along with us, an entire generation of players grew up. It's been a very interesting, exciting, and challenging journey.</p>



<p><strong>Were you aware that it would take such a long time to get the game to version 1.0, or did you expect to launch earlier?</strong></p>



<p>That's a very good question. Of course, we planned to release it sooner. But creating a game, especially one with almost a decade of background, is a very complex process. We faced numerous obstacles in the form of various subsystems; some things we rewrote from scratch, other things we were the first to do, things no one had ever done before us. I think we would have released Tarkov sooner if we could predict the future and knew what we would face. We knew what we were doing, but at times we didn't know how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov is arguably the forefather of extraction shooters. How does it feel to see it gain such popularity, and what do you think about the genre's latest success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark's ARC Raiders</a>?</strong></p>



<p>We are aware of our significance: we managed to create not just a game, but an entire subgenre – the extraction shooter. And when we see games that find their audience, like ARC Raiders, which you mentioned, we are only happy about it. After all, the more good games, the better. Unfortunately, not everyone views us the same way and sees us as a competitor; everyone strives to proclaim themselves the "Tarkov killer" and tries to "knock Tarkov off its pedestal." We never had the goal of climbing onto that pedestal. We are simply making a game. A game that we ourselves enjoy, and which, in its uniqueness, is suited specifically for hardcore players. That's all.</p>



<p><strong>Will the 1.0 release's content be as substantial as previous large updates (e.g., Reserve or Streets)?</strong></p>



<p>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be a heat map or death cam feature in version 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>No, these features will not be in the release version, but we still plan to implement them in the future.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the roadmap for expansions or content updates after 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>The first DLC players can expect after release is "Scav Life." Players will dive into the story of the Scavs and see them from a different perspective. They will have their own little Hideout, as well as progression opportunities. In fact, we have a very broad planning horizon – there will be new locations and major events. Tarkov hasn't been fully explored and still holds many secrets.</p>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game is when it comes to anti-cheat measures? Are you looking to make further enhancements?</strong></p>



<p>The release version carries many changes aimed directly at combating cheaters. We have done a tremendous amount of work in this area and sincerely hope that things will be good on this front. Nevertheless, we certainly don't plan to stop here and will continue to improve our anti-cheat mechanics. We have a very large department at the studio working exclusively on this problem.</p>



<p><strong>What improvements will be made to server stability and matchmaking?</strong></p>



<p>I must point out that server stability isn't 100% within our control. However, the aspects that are our responsibility, including matchmaking, have undergone many changes, and we expect significant improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be further improvements in Quality of Life (QoL) for usability and user interface?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, this is also one of the important points that has our attention. We will continue to improve Quality of Life (QoL) and the User Interface (UI), both at release and after it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How are the narrative/story modes progressing? Is there anything you can share about that?</strong></p>



<p>The story consists of a chain of story quests. A clear storyline. It's not a narrative mode in the traditional sense. Answering your question, I can only say that players will finally have the opportunity to thoroughly understand what happened to the city and to escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p><strong>Are there plans to improve AI behavior, especially for Scavs and bosses?</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the Black Division alone is a significant addition. But the AI and the game as a whole have undergone a huge number of changes.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov does not currently support controllers; however, a substantial number of PC players regularly utilize this control system in other games. Are you planning to add it in the future? Also, are you thinking about console ports?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</p>



<p><strong>What else does the future hold for Battlestate Games now that a decade-long project is concluding?</strong></p>



<p>We have very big plans. We plan to expand and do even more – to continue developing and deepening Tarkov, and to expand the universe. You will all see it soon.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
