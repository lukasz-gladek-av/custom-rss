		<p>Gamescom Opening Live has kicked off with a new look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The video shows part of the Most Wanted level from the Campaign, Epic would be one word to describe the footage, check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Ops 6 at gamescom - “Most Wanted” Campaign Level Playthrough" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fh03Y7Hgv08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“While the Gulf War commands the global spotlight, a shadowy clandestine force has infiltrated the highest levels of the CIA, branding anyone who resists as traitors. Exiled from their agency and country that once hailed them as heroes, Black Ops veteran Frank Woods and his team find themselves hunted by the military machine that created them.”</p>
<p>The video also shows off a new feature which they have called Omnimovement. “Across the entire game, players will push beyond their limits with several new global innovations, including omnimovement, the most fluid boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty movement to date, that utilizes the ability to seamlessly chain combat maneuvers in any direction.”</p>
<p>As usual the game will include multiplayer with 16 new maps at launch, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6. There will also be the “return of a more traditional Prestige system, bigger and more rewarding than ever.”</p>

<p>Of course there is also a zombies mode, “Black Ops 6 also marks the return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps at launch. Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.”</p>
<p>There are two versions available to pre-order. The “Cross Gen Standard Edition” includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
<li>Early Access to the Open Beta</li>
<li>Woods Operator Pack</li>
<li>Reflect 115 Camo Pack</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the “Vault Edition” that includes</p>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
<li>Early Access to the Open Beta</li>
<li>Woods Operator Pack</li>
<li>Reflect 115 Camo Pack</li>
<li>Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack</li>

Activision have just screened an abbreviated video of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign level “Most Wanted”, in which you and a buddy infiltrate a US fundraiser to save returning character Adler from Bad Dudes. Good news, people who like Call Of Duty: this looks like Call Of Duty. It’s got a homing knife, an exploding remote-controlled car and a big chap in full face armour with an overcompensatory minigun. Catch the full video below.

<p>

The video goes into fast-forward at intervals, denying us a complete picture, but we get a sense of the framework. “Do it loud or quiet”, you say? That sounds like Call Of Duty giving you the option of a stealthy area walkthrough, though the footage doesn’t show us this. There are also brief glimpses of an equipment wheel, a sprinkling of slow-mo QTEs, and some gadgets. 
</p>
<p>
At one point, the player uses a camera to snap somebody’s mug and fake a retinal scan. There’s also one of those elevator escapes where they have to break through the ceiling and abseil and OOPS, an explosion is happening. Then it’s off to a big hall to play 'steer the homing knife in slow motion', with a hectic motorbike escape to finish. Seems solid enough. I’ve played crazier Black Ops levels, but this is respectably frenetic. Also, ouch, that business with the deep fat fryer.
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6 is out 25th October, with a beta coming at the end of August.

            <p>The trailers of Gamescom 2024 want to be here with you, explained Keighley in his opening monologue. They are not directed <em>at</em> you. They are <em>with</em> you. That's lovely. Thanks videogames.  And if - as we surely must - we judge the eagerness of these adverts to spend time with us by how quickly they appear on our screens, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a>sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> surely loves us the most.</p>
<p>Do we love it back? Who knows. But it does exist, and it isn’t using a subtitle. That’s got to count for something, right?</p>

<p>If you can tear yourself away from watching that bountiful snippet on repeat, here’s a<a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1825957079879921829"> Xitter post</a> by Gearbox with the clip and a promised 2025 release date. “Watch it again (and again, and again)!” reads the post. I hope I don’t sound cynical when I say that, nah, I’m good actually. I got all the information I needed the first time.</p>
<p>We haven’t seen a new mainline series entry since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> in 2019, but the last game to bear the name was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-tales-from-the-borderlands">New Tales From The Borderlands</a>. “This is my favourite game,” wrote Alice Bee (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-tales-from-the-borderlands-review">her review</a>. “I cannot get over how good this is. I couldn’t stop laughing. It reminded me of my favourite author, Ernest Cline.” Strong praise, Alice. Strong praise.</p>

Thanks to the Gamescom announcement, we know Dying Light: The Beast is on the horizon. It features the return of Kyle Crane from the original Dying Light—a fan-favorite character everyone wanted to see return.</p>



<p>This appears to be far more horror-focused. A world full of zombies serves as the background while a more terrifying presence lurks in the shadows, hunting at will. </p>



<p>But more importantly, this is a unique, standalone experience from the other titles in the franchise. It’s set in a rural region, handcrafted and confined for a more thrilling experience overall. We’ll take on the role of Kyle Crane, who escaped from the brutal experiments that kept him out of the picture for years.</p>

<p>According to the exhilarating reveal, Dying Light: The Beast features a welcome 20 hours of gameplay! It’s nice whenever a developer respects your time and doesn’t bloat the game to 100+ hours just for the sake of creating a longer experience.</p>



<p>We’re excited to see more from Dying Light: The Beast, hopefully at Gamescom, but certainly in the coming days!</p>



<p>For now, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist the game on Steam</a>!</p>

<p>We’re excited to see more from Gamescom, but Dying Light: The Beast definitely stole the show for many of us!</p>

<p>The Borderlands franchise is back as Take-Two Interactive and Gearbox have announced Borderlands 4 during Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a short trailer during the event along with the reveal that it will launch in 2025.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“In this next installment of the definitive looter shooter, players will assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they blast their way through hordes of enemies in search of new treasures to loot on an all-new planet,” the trailer’s description reads.</p>



<p>There was no gameplay shown in the teaser trailer. It wouldn’t be surprising, though, to see the first look at gameplay by the end of the year.</p>







<p>The last mainline Borderlands game was Borderlands 3 in 2019. Two spinoff games, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and New Tales from the Borderlands were both released in 2022.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is the first Borderlands game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-sells-gearbox-entertainment-to-take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since Take-Two acquired Gearbox</a> earlier this year. When it releases, the game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

The announcement trailer doesn't provide too many concrete details about the next entry in the series, but it does seem tied directly to the ending of Borderlands 3.</p><p>The trailer shows a large flying phoenix symbol, which is the symbol of the Fire Hawk, who is Lilith from the previous entries in the series. This same symbol appears at the end of Borderlands 3 as well, linking the two games directly. The rest of the trailer showed what appeared to be a moon cracking and dropping meteors on a nearby planet, with the destruction seemingly caused by the phoenix symbol. One of those meteors drops a psycho mask, which a mysterious character with robot hands picks up.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Spoilers for the end of Borderlands 3</strong><strong>,</strong> which saw Lilith use her power as a Siren to stop Pandora's moon from destroying the planet. Lilith succeeds, but she dies in the process.

                <p>Rebellion Developments has announced Sniper Elite: Resistance during Gamescom Opening Night Live's pre-show. According to the debut trailer, it will focus (at least partly) around the warfront in France.

This time, however, Hawker is the star in a storyline set alongside the events of Sniper Elite 5.</p><p>We expect plenty of x-ray views of skulls exploding, and there is a very high chance of getting to shoot Hitler in his one testicle, if this game is faithful to both history and its series.

Thus far, Fairburne--an OSS operative during World War 2--has conducted missions in North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany.</p><p>The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. It will also launch straight into Xbox Game Pass when it arrives.</p>

            <p>
We already knew it was coming, thanks to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBusvbtDKa0">post-credits teaser</a> at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-devil-in-me-leak-reveals-next-dark-pictures-anthology-game-to-be-a-sci-fi-horror">end of 2022's The Devil in Me</a>, but developer Supermassive has now confirmed its sci-fi horror outing Directive 8020 will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.
</p>
<p>
Directive 8020, taking one fist of Alien and another of The Thing then smushing the two together, places players aboard the colony ship Cassiopeia, where its crew must escape an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey.
</p>
<p>
"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," teases Supermassive. "12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realise they are far from being alone... As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth."

<p>
"Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight," it continues. "Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!"
</p>
<p>
A press release accompanying today's Directive 8020 reveal trailer suggests something a little more ambitious compared to earlier titles in Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology series, with talk of persistent real-time threats, improvised weapons, stealth mechanics, and "intense survival gameplay", alongside the usual branching narrative storyline.
</p>
<p>
Directive 8020, which stars Lashana Lynch in the role of "ground-breaking astronaut" Young, will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam when it launches next year.

            <p>
Bully, Rockstar's enjoyable schoolboy adventure game, is now available as part of the GTA+ subscription on PlayStation, Xbox and "soon" on compatible iPhone and Android devices. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-remembered-bully-exists">Bully would be coming to GTA+ earlier this year</a>, back in April. We've been waiting for word on exactly when ever since.
</p>
<p>
It's great to have an easier way to play Bully again - though Rockstar describes the GTA+ catalogue as "rotating", so it's unclear how long it'll stick around. Also on GTA+? LA Noire, Red Dead Redemption, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>.
</p>
<p>Priced at £5/$6 a month, the subscription also grants a stipend of $1m in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-online-weekly-update-time-9302">GTA Online</a> fictional money. 
</p>
<p>Bully was first launched back in 2006 for PlayStation 2, then popped up on PC, Wii and Xbox 360. While we all wait for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - and as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bully-2-never-got-off-the-ground-says-rockstar-source">we're seemingly not getting a Bully 2</a> - this is one to savour revisiting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Announced at this year's Geoffcom, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> is a new game courtesy of the vehicular bods behind MudRunner and SnowRunner. This means it's very much a simulation game where you're fighting terrain with tyres, except this time you aren't just driving about, but managing a fleet of machines to carry out heavy construction work. Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>RoadCraft looks to take Saber's expertise in tricky terrain, and how vehicles react to that tricky terrain, by plugging it into more of a management sim. This means it's more about pinging to and fro between your vehicles to repurpose mess into something pretty. You'll take control of bulldozers to clear blocked paths, use transporters to carry vehicles out of sticky situations, and use cranes to lift bits and bobs with utmost precision. I'm particularly enamoured by the idea of spreading "hot asphalt using your paver", then flattening it with a roller. There's no way this isn't the most satisfying thing in video games.</p>

<p>And as it's construction-based, you'll harvest resources like sand, wood, or tar to make the terrain suitable for your iron fleet. "Supply factories and sand quarries to ensure a continuous production of resources needed for roads and bridges", says the press release. You might notice in the trailer, too, but you'll also need to plot routes on a map so your vehicles don't get in each other's way. This suggests there's an element of automation in the resource gathering side of things, alongside having direct control of vehicles. Only time will tell if you can whizz into the driver's seat of <em>any</em> vehicle, or whether that's reserved for a more specific thing.</p>
<p>The game's due out sometime in 2025 and you can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/">Steam</a>.</p>

Adapted from a similarly named sci-fi novel by author Dmitry Glukhovsky, it didn’t quite take the world by storm, but the story-driven FPS about a community trying to survive the nuclear apocalypse by hiding in the subway stations and tunnels of Moscow earned enough love to spawn a franchise. Releasing over the 2010s, the <em>Metro </em>series became the loving torchbearer of janky “weird fiction” shooters after the long hiatus of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">now-returning <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series</a></span>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,196049,196163" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The entirety of the <em>Metro </em>trilogy is on a pretty steep sale right now on Steam, while select titles from the series are cheap on other platforms.<strong> You can pick up the whole series, including </strong><em><strong>Metro 2033</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><strong> Metro: Last Light</strong></em><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979"><em><strong>Metro Exodus</strong></em></a></span><strong> (and its expansion pass) for just over $9 on Steam. On PlayStation, you can also pick up remasters of both <em>2033</em> and <em>Last Light</em> for $3 apiece.</strong></p><p>The <em>Metro </em>series was developed by 4A Games, which consisted of a lot of ex-developers from the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series, and they share a lot of the same DNA. Both take place in the fallout of nuclear apocalypses in Russia and both are survival games that blend sci-fi and supernatural elements. Whereas <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>has been more traditionally open-ended though, taking place in the fallout of a second Chernobyl disaster in a region only known as the Zone, the <em>Metro </em>games were far more linear and story-focused. </p><p><em>Metro </em>focuses on the life of Artyom, a young man who comes into his own as a ranger in the Moscow Metro. Throughout the first two games, he investigates beings known as the Dark Ones while trying to navigate the conflicts between the varying districts of survivors that call the underground home. These first two titles, <em>2033 </em>and <em>Last Light</em>, are often lauded for their tremendous and claustrophobic atmosphere, with most missions occurring in the insufferably dark tunnels under Moscow. On occasion, missions take place above-ground, where the players must don equipment to protect themselves from radiation damage, mutated creatures, and supernatural phenomena and anomalies, all while constantly maintaining the equipment keeping them alive.<br></p><p>This maintenance explodes into a whole crafting system in the third game, <em>Exodus</em>, which is my favorite of the trilogy. Abandoning the cluttered tunnels of Russia, Artyom, his wife Anna, and a party of allies hop onboard a train and explore the rest of war-ravaged Europe—along the way, <em>Exodus </em>becomes <em>much </em>more like <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R</em>. It shuttles you between hostile open environments and tasks you with crafting the tools of your survival, including gas masks and ammo, and strips the series’ UI elements to make an entirely diegetic interface.<br></p><p>For example, the compass you use is on Artyom’s wristwatch, which also counts down the use of minute-long air filters for his mask. Speaking of the gas mask, it can crack from firefights and needs to be sealed with duct tape and eventually repaired in order to be operable. Rifles are gas-pumped and shoot bullet-like pellets you craft from scarce materials! You spot points of interest with your binoculars and mark them in a map that Artyom needs to manually pull out. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8geGHbWIMXA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8geGHbWIMXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many have said before</a></span>, <em>Exodus </em>has the most tremendous sense of place, and for what it’s worth, it is <em>the </em>most immersive game I’ve played.</p><p>I love <em>Exodus </em>and still think so fondly about how much it forces you to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metro-exodus-the-kotaku-review-1832740979">consider and take care of your stuff</a></span>. Even if I don’t remember every name of its cast, the tender moments they share in their personal cars onboard the Aurora have stayed with me for longer than I thought possible. The gunplay is fraught with tension as you weigh the challenge ahead against your scarcity of supplies. Even if it doesn’t always come together due to bugs and a level of polish that are emblematic of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/eurojank&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/eurojank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eurojank</a></span>” titles of the era like the <em>Metro </em>and<em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R </em>series, it’s ambitious and I can’t fault it for shooting for the stars.</p><p>Ahead of the release of <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 </em>this fall, I can’t think of a better game series to play. <em>Exodus </em>is the longest but can still be wrapped up in about 30 hours if you try and do everything on offer. And I encourage you to because <em>Exodus </em>is a gorgeous game that’ll stick with you for some time if my own experience is any indication. The first two games are about 10-15 hours each, so you could spend a month of your downtime picking at them and be ready for <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2</em>’s launch in November. Run, don’t walk, to pick up these games, and you’re welcome in advance. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The preview version goes live today for players who are members of the Xbox Insiders initiative, with more games being added to the Game Pass Standard library throughout the preview period. So while we still don’t know exactly which games will be included in that tier of the program at launch, players should get a better idea in the days and weeks ahead. </p><p>But the biggest question is still how long it will take for new games to get added to Standard. Earlier this summer, Microsoft announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059">it was hiking the price of Game Pass Ultimate</a></span> and creating a new tier called Standard that wouldn’t get big games that hit Game Pass on day one of release, one of the big selling points of the service since its inception. So while Standard is $15 a month instead of Ultimate’s $20 a month, it won’t be getting <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em>’s <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> expansion the day they come out. </p><p>“Some games coming to Game Pass Ultimate (day one games or other game entries) will not be immediately available with Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date (can be up to 12 months or more and will vary by title),”  senior community lead Megan Spurr wrote over at Xbox Wire today. “We’ll continue to share with all Game Pass members when games are being added and available to play for each plan.”</p><p>It’s unclear if this waiting period will be announced for each game ahead of release, or will be its own sort of mystery exclusivity period that fans have to speculate about when deciding if and when to subscribe to Standard vs. Ultimate. It’s also possible that third-party day-and-date games, like <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, could have launches that vary wildly across both tiers. Pardon the pun but it sounds anything but “standard.” </p><p>This big shift in Game Pass comes ahead of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s release in October, the first game in the hit multiplayer shooter series to get a day-and-date release on a subscription gaming service, and likely the best-selling game yet that will have appeared on Game Pass. That’s in stark contrast to last year when Xbox owners could play <em>Starfield</em> for a whole month starting the day it came out for just $11. Its upcoming expansion, <em>Shattered Space</em>, will now require a $20 monthly subscription instead. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>InZoi--Krafton's wildly ambitious life-simulation game--seems poised to let you do almost anything, as anyone, and in a new Gamescom trailer, we got to see just how that can play out. You could experience the most joyful moments of someone's life or watch them at their very worst.</p><p>The trailer begins with a cat walking up an invisible set of steps before activating a device that seems to give them access to their own world. In-universe, we see friends chatting on the street, giving each other high-fives, and exchanging presents. Elsewhere, more-substantial events are taking place, such as a wedding, and we later see the same married couple interacting with their baby.</p>

      </div>
<p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows, naturally, as we see people slapping each other and angrily throwing garbage. A car accident results in both drivers blaming the other, and a novice cook starts an enormous fire in her home. For anyone familiar with The Sims, that one should feel right at home.</p><p>InZoi doesn't have a release date yet, but Krafton is offering the InZoi: Character Studio tool on Steam from August 21-26. Characters made using the detailed customization tools will then be usable once InZoi exits early access. </p>

We now have our first look at the class in action, and it looks pretty sick.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Y’all tech nerds can enjoy that, but I’m more concerned with how the mage class operates in the more action-driven combat. <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> were certainly closer to full-blown action RPGs, but they still leaned at least somewhat into the original <em>Origins</em>’ tactical roots. <em>The Veilguard</em> has pivoted away from them entirely, and just how that would impact mages has been one of the biggest question marks hanging over the game. Now we see a mage Rook (the player character) using a staff, capable of both close-range combat and long-range spells. The mage seems to have a few tricks up their sleeve, with a close-range slam ability, what looks like a beam of green Fade-like magic to pester enemies from afar, and more powerful energy spells that can strike multiple enemies at once.</p><p>The standard attack has you flicking your staff as you fire nondescript damage spells, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1825926716755521581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1825926716755521581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to BioWare executive producer Michael Gamble</a></span>, mage players will also be able to use an orb or dagger as their primary weapon instead of a staff. So it sounds like even this trailer is only showing off one way to play the mage. Check out the video below:</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">on October 31</a></span>. Fans have been waiting for nearly a decade for the game, as it will finally pick up where <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>left off in 2015 with its <em>Trespasser </em>DLC.

"It will be used to create a quality assurance buffer, giving more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready.

It has been a long journey, but we're near the final stages of development and will share the release date once we are confident with the game’s level of polish."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxFk0g11a6c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AxFk0g11a6c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in Q4 2024, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be avoiding some of the biggest games of the year launching during the holiday season. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, and Silent Hill 2 are just some of the noteworthy releases on the gaming calendar, and between them, there are dozens of other games that could have potentially derailed the momentum of Bloodlines 2.</p><p>The game had a troubled development cycle after it was first announced, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/" data-ref-id="1100-6497078">and was almost canceled</a> after its original developer Hardsuit Labs was taken off of the project after yet another delay. The Chinese Room stepped in to take over and was officially confirmed to be leading the project several months later. The developer has been fairly active in showing off several of the new features in Bloodlines 2--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sticks-and-stones-and-words-can-hurt-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/1100-6525797/" data-ref-id="1100-6525797">like a dynamic dialogue system</a> that can alter gameplay significantly--and it has also fleshed out its vampiric underworld with quick glimpses of clans like the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcDEhivcr-w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ventrue</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/is1ktPTpGUA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brujah</a>, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/9gyzRvi3NTs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tremere</a>.</p><p>Set in Seattle, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will take players into the dark underbelly of a city on the brink of all-out war, and as an elder vampire, it'll be up to them to influence the outcome of this conflict between factions.</p>

Spreading the love equally between all of them as far as skins and other cosmetics go is a tall order, one that would be unreasonable to expect. However, as <em>Overwatch 2 </em>approaches its second anniversary, the community is getting increasingly more frustrated with Blizzard, as the developer continues to to prioritize certain heroes each season with new cosmetics while others are left with crumbs—if they even get anything at all.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,192616" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Venture, the 40th hero added to <em>Overwatch 2</em>, has been the center point in these conversations after they received no Legendary skins since joining the roster in April.

So while an incoming skin is <em>something</em>, it draws attention to how other characters get what feels like preferential treatment from the development team. It’s clear from the responses to Keller’s statement that fans are not happy with the wait.</p><p>For some, Kiriko, the first support hero who was added to <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s roster in 2022, has been the face of this problem. She’s been present for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StarClericINC/status/1823773465473602046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StarClericINC/status/1823773465473602046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 seasons and has received 14 skins</a></span>, which is the highest of any of the new heroes added in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Mercy, who has been in the game since the original’s launch, has also been a contentious character as far as skin favoritism goes, especially as she’s been a face of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mercy-thai-lunar-new-year-skin-lifeweaver-1851074642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mercy-thai-lunar-new-year-skin-lifeweaver-1851074642"><em>Overwatch </em>giving heroes outfits based on other cultures</a></span> while characters who originate in those cultures go without. Both of these characters are receiving new skins in season 12 while heroes like Venture aren’t.</p><p>Season 12 has been especially thorny, as its Egyptian-themed battle pass left some heroes wanting, despite them having stronger ties to the mythology than ones who were heavily featured. Reaper is getting this season’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mythic-skin-store-prisms-battle-pass-mercy-1851414356">customizable mythic skin</a></span> that dresses him up as Anubis, the Egyptian god of funerary rites, a sensible connection considering Reaper’s ties to death. However, Ramattra, the synthetic omnic tank, and his Null Sector faction were originally based on Egyptian mythology in early designs. There’s even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch_gamepedia/images/c/c1/RamattraEgypt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20231201111202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch_gamepedia/images/c/c1/RamattraEgypt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20231201111202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concept art of the character</a></span> with a sand-like motif that was scrapped, but could have made for an appropriate mythic skin. To the studio’s credit, the actual Egyptian heroes, Ana and Pharah, are getting a fancy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1824153499090784732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1824153499090784732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mythic weapon</a></span> and a store skin respectively, but Reaper’smythic skin stings for Ramattra fans who have received only a paltry skin selection since the tank was added. They’re coping with fan art of what the Ramattra Anubis skin could have looked like.</p><p>As a person who spreads his <em>Overwatch 2 </em>time across multiple heroes, I tend to have at least one of my favorites featured in each season. But the direct comparisons between characters like Kiriko and Mercy, who consistently get top-tier cosmetics, and Venture, who has received nothing since launch and won’t for several seasons, highlights the gulf between heroes. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
