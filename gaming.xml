		<p>Football Manager 26 gives the impression of a youngster being given their first senior debut for a big club, stepping into the public eye looking to take the reins from the old guard. It is a new chapter for Sports Interactive’s long running series with a leap to a new game engine and a shift in how it is presented to players. After quite a few hours playing through Football Manager 26, it is a game that shows some promise, but needs a lot of long term updates and changes before it is ready to be considered a successful switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The caveat is that currently Football Manager 26 is considered to be in beta ahead of its official 4th November release, with Sports Interactive releasing regular fixes and updates through this window. That said, Football Manager 26 is clearly a very different experience to the Football Manager games that came before.</p>


<p>A new user interface comes with different tiles and cards you can click on to get more information, there’s a change in the matchday presentation, removal of touchline shouts, removal of gestures for team talks and press conferences, and a delayed release for international management to line up with next year’s World Cup. A positive addition is the long-awaited introduction of women’s leagues as well as new nation leagues that expand the database.</p>


<p>The user interface takes getting used to with a change to menus and the amount of data that is presented to you, split across tabs like the top level Portal, Recruitment, Matchday, Squad, and Club. Within each tab various tiles present information like league position, performance, finances or whatever else you want to look up. While it does look modern, it will take a while to get used to and retrain the muscle memory after so many years of the Football Manager UI being relatively stable. While there is a lot of information, it can be quite overwhelming to find what you need quickly and needing to keep clicking to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Information could be much clearly presented too. News stories are not shown in detail when you open a message in the portal, instead needing to click on it to see the full details. It was much clearer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">Football Manager 24</a>. When it comes to the matchday experience player fitness levels are much harder to read. Where FM24 had big and bold player tiles easily showing the information, the same information is more compact in FM26, and it is not as easy on the eye. This goes for spotting injuries during matches and player skill levels as well. At one point a player was injured who needed subbing off, but it was not clear looking at the tactics screen who I was needing to hook off the pitch.</p>

<p>The change extends to the general tactics screen. Sports Interactive wants players to get a lot more detail when it comes to sorting tactics and there is a depth of information. With tactics you now don’t just select a playstyle, a couple of formations to train, set instructions, and slot your players in. Now, formations are split into in possession and out of possession, so you can set two different tactical approaches to deal with different opponents. It is a good idea to really develop your team and reflects more of how modern teams approach different game states, but there are issues in just moving players and positions around. Swapping players either lags or sometimes does not happen as intended, and trying to adjust positions is not as smooth as in previous instalments.</p>

<p>What is clear right now is that Football Manager 26, in this current stage at least, is the first step of a new era. Much like the start of any new era that comes with a challenge of rebuilding and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better, but with what I have played so far I do not think this is going to be the entry that will hit the potential of what the switch to the new engine and implementation of new features can bring. In my view, it may take one or two more years for the rebuild to really meet its potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't feature any of the additional content found in the War of the Lions release and the mobile versions of the game, but this could quickly become a thing of the past, as a new mod now available online restores a small portion of this additional content.</p>



<p>The WotL Character Repair mod, developed by Dana Crysalis and now available for download for free from Nexus Mods, fixes Balthier and Luso, making it possible to add them to the party via Cheat Engine tables and use them in battle with their unique Jobs and ability sets. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to add the two characters to the game without using Cheat Engine due to how difficult it currently is to add new events to the game. Installation requires using the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2">Reloaded-II loader</a>, which can be less intuitive than just dropping some files into an installation folder.  Still, these are only minor inconveniences, considering the value of the mod.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Balthier-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Balthier and Lus</em><em>o</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles thanks to this new mod</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Curious to see how well this new Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles mod works, I briefly tested it and can confirm that it indeed works as intended. I was able to add both Balthier and Luso to a battle party and use them as if they were a regular vanilla unit, which is not possible to do without this Repair mod, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-war-of-the-lions-content/">as my previous attempts testify</a>. Hopefully, more fixes will come for the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs to make them usable and further expand the game's content.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not the definitive version of the popular tactical role-playing game, lacking the aforementioned War of the Lions content, this new release is more than worth playing thanks to the many improvements it brings. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">You can learn more about them by checking out my review.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Trump Take Candy]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trump-take-candy.1339507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s getting more expensive to fill my <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251">Halloween trick-or-treat bowl</a> each year as the bags at the store get pricier but smaller. First Trump <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-take-egg-meme-explained">took egg</a>. Then he <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">took video game</a>. Now he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-kid-trick-or-treaters-you-have-no-weight-n815196">take candy</a>.</p> <p>I normally wait until the last minute to pick up candy for Halloween. This entails going to the supermarket during my lunch break on Halloween only to find that all of the Halloween-themed bags have already been replaced with Christmas ones. This usually leaves me with no option but to buy the only candy that normally comes individually wrapped in bulk: blow-pops and stacks and stacks of fun-sized chocolate bars. Beggars can’t be choosers. I pay whatever the Halloween gods demand. No child will leave my house emptyhanded on All Hallows’ Eve.</p> <p>This year I broke with tradition and headed to the supermarket a few nights ahead of time. The pickings were still slim but not altogether terrible. The prices, on the other hand, stopped me in my tracks. It was supposed to be a quick shop. In and out. Instead, I stared at the bags of Snickers and Reece’s Cups like I was picking which arm to get amputated. A big bag of assorted Hershey’s candy was almost $17. That couldn’t be right. I checked again. Ouch. I went for a small bag of Butterfingers. It was $6.59. That would not be nearly enough. Five smaller bags or two bigger ones? Either way, I was getting hosed.</p>

   <p>The irony, of course, is that I do not need nearly this much candy. I always have a ton left over, sitting in the bowl and rotting my teeth through mid-November. But what if this year is different? What if busses of children roll up to my street demanding dispensation? Better safe than sorry. And so I pay to subsidize the fat cats at Mars and Hershey. Apparently I have it easy. One particularly grim thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inflation/comments/1oiotkg/has_anyone_noticed_the_cost_of_the_halloween/">the inflation subreddit</a> tells a different story.</p>

 <p>“I just spent $95 on 4 small bags of candy bar minis (110 mini pieces per bag), and 1 bag of jolly rancher gummy minis that will not get me through the night,” it reads. Some say they’ll just hide in their bedrooms that night watching TV with the lights out. Others are downgrading to cheaper candy. “Stopped doing chocolate and candy bars as that is where inflation is taking the biggest hit,” one person wrote. “Gummy and hard candies are still reasonable. $16 got us like 80 small packs of sour patch kids and when there are gone, they’re gone. Lights out. No more.”</p>

 <h2>Tariffs and bad cocoa harvests</h2> <p>Is candy actually getting way more expensive? Why yes, yes it is. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">NBC News reports</a> that multiple years of bad cocoa harvests in regions like West Africa, due in part to rising temperatures and changing climate conditions, have created a shortage that’s led to skyrocketing prices. “The cost of chocolate has surged nearly 30% since last Halloween,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/halloween-candy-hauls-shrink-chocolate-swapped-cheaper-alternatives">reports Fox News</a>.</p>

 <p>But gummies and other non-chocolate candy is also up. “General manufacturing costs for candy makers, including energy, labor and transportation, have risen 37 percent since early 2024,” one supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">told NBC News</a>. One TikTok deal hunter told the outlet that her normal go-to discount tricks have still gone from $1.50 a bag to $2.50 in some cases this year.</p>   <p>And of course there’s the Trump tariff factor. “The tariffs have hit every single piece of what goes into every single thing,” a small chocolate business owner in North Carolina <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/business/why-halloween-candy-is-getting-more-expensive-and-less-chocolate-y">told CNN</a>. “There is no new normal.” As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/halloween-candy-prices-trump-tariffs-climate-change"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a>, “Donald Trump has placed tariffs on the biggest exporters of chocolate to the US. Imports from the Ivory Coast, the largest producer of cocoa, are taxed with a 21 percent tariff. Ecuador, the second-largest producer, faces a 15 percent tariff.” Prices of Tootsie Roll lollipops alone are up 30 percent on average this year, according to a recent report <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/tricks-treats-and-tariffs-how-trump-is-making-halloween-more-expensive/">by The Century Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the cruelest part of all of this is that amid the current government shutdown, the Trump administration is set to let SNAP food benefits for the poorest Americans run out on November 1, the day after Halloween. Anyone on food assistance this week is stuck salvaging every penny they can instead of splurging on some candy for the neighborhood kids or their own. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/millions-face-food-aid-cliff-us-government-shutdown-standoff-2025-10-29/">The program currently has</a> access to $5.5 billion in reserve funds that Republicans are refusing to spend as they hold families hostage in negotiations with Democrats.</p>  <p>What Trump take, others can give back. You can <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank">search your area for a local food bank</a> to donate to. If you can afford it, try matching the funds you spend on candy this Halloween for food assistance in your region.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has only been around for a year as of today (October 30), and to say it’s been a success would be an understatement.</p>



<p>But just how much of a success has it truly been?</p>



<p>According to estimates from data firm <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pocketgamer</a>, the game has earned nearly $1.3 billion in revenue over its first 12 months. That makes it the most profitable Pokémon mobile game ever, surpassing the roughly $1 billion Pokémon Go earned in its first year.</p>



<p>As far as downloads go, AppMagic says it’s been downloaded more than 150 million times so far. That comes after it was downloaded </p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>Released on October 30, 2024, Pokémon TCG Pocket is a mobile version of the popular trading card game. In the game, players buy and open packs to collect cards. These cards, as expected, can then be used to build full decks and battle against other players in a simplified version of the traditional card game.</p>



<p>In addition to collecting and battling, players can trade cards with friends. There are restrictions, though. Trades can only happen with friends and have to be of the same rarity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Halloween! It’s time for a <strong>spooky edition </strong>of NYT Connections. There are a few words in today’s puzzle synonymous with Halloween, which you’ll find if you scroll down to check out my NYT Connections hints for today. If you’re a fan of classic cartoons or video games, today’s puzzle should be a simple one for you.</p>



<p>In any case, I’ve assembled the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can jump right to the answers and get on with your Halloween!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-31">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 31)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #873:</p>



<ul>
<li>GHOST</li>



<li>PUMPKIN</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BED</li>



<li>ANCHOR</li>



<li>BEAR</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>CHERRIES</li>



<li>CHAIR</li>



<li>DOTS</li>



<li>SLIPPER</li>



<li>CAP</li>



<li>PIPE</li>



<li>PORRIDGE</li>



<li>SPINACH</li>



<li>MAGIC WAND</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all items or characters Goldilocks encounters in the bears’ home</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word is tied to Cinderella’s transformation or helpers in her fairy tale journey</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all iconic items associated with the sailor man himself</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are all elements from the classic Ms. Pac-Man game, including her accessories and in-game items</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 31.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-31-873">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 31 (#873)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BACKBONE, COURAGE, HEART, SPIRIT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – MEDIUM, OUTLET, PLATFORM, VENUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – SACRUM, SEITAN, SEYCHELLES, SÉANCE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ABECEDARIUM, COMPUTER KEYBOARD, OUIJA BOARD, SCRABBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

                <p>The eagerly anticipated forest biome for Peak is arriving on November 5, according to a video published by developer Landfall. The new biome will come as part of the Roots update, which could include other content, in November.</p><p>Judging by the short video, the new biome will feature a dense forest filled with redwood-like trees, vines, player-grabbing spiders, and wooden structures built into the trees. The video also shows several mushrooms scattered in the background.</p>

<p>Landfall has not shared much else on social media or Steam, leaving players to speculate about what new badges might come with the update, which biome this new map will rotate with in the daily map updates, and what else might be hidden among the trees of this new area.</p><p>The last major update introduced the mesa biome, a desert dominated by tornadoes and scorching heat, which rotated with the alpine biome. Fans speculate that this one will rotate with the tropics biome, which comes directly after the starting biome, shore.</p><p>Other updates have included new badges alongside new biomes. The mesa update brought several challenges specific to it, so fans believe they will have new badges to collect next month as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast is out, Techland can start focusing again on Dying Light 2: Stay Human. The live-service, open-world zombie title has always enjoyed seasonal updates, and this Halloween, that remains the case. Techland has introduced a new event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human dubbed ‘Halloween Showdown’, and it transforms the game – <strong>for a time</strong>.</p>



<p>In Halloween Showdown, players must fight and kill special infected enemies to secure candies that they can use to unlock exclusive rewards from warring factions. The ‘special infected’ are the game’s normal enemies, but reimagined to suit the spooky Halloween season.</p>



<h2 id="h-halloween-hits-stay-human">Halloween Hits Stay Human</h2>



<p>In a recent release, the team at Techland revealed the arrival of the Dying Light 2 Halloween event, named Halloween Showdown. It’s set to run from today to November 20, giving users a fair window in which to unlock exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Here’s a segment from that release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The city of Villedor</strong>&nbsp;is fully decorated for Halloween, with returning themed enemies including Pumpkintiles, Witches, Scaregoons, Virals, and Biters. In Tower Raid, Halloween-themed enemies take over the Tower, with new decorations, layouts, and rooftop battles. Players can also unlock new characters like Cursed Pirate and the permanent Tower Raid character CyberRaider, while the updated reward track offers Toxic and UV weapons and a new scoreboard for competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This new Dying Light 2 event goes hand-in-hand with some featured community maps, themed around Halloween, being pushed by Techland. From November 13, limited bounties will unlock across these experiences, allowing players to grind for more rewards outside of the base game.</p>



<p>As you can also imagine, the special event also brings about some themed Halloween Bundles, which include one with a futuristic rifle that promises to ‘defy gravity’.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast continues to be a success more than a month after the game hit the market. Players are still neck-deep in the Call of the Beast challenge path, slaying the undead to their heart’s content. In a recent release, Techland explained what has been added in the new 1.3 patch for Dying Light: The Beast, including new enemy behavior, animations, and improvements.</p>



<p>It’s not an enormous list, but then again, it’s not an enormous game. If you’re interested in checking out the full patch notes for Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update, read on.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-patch-notes-for-dying-light-the-beast-1-3">Full Patch Notes For Dying Light: The Beast 1.3</h2>



<p>One of the best new features added in Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update is a pacifist mechanic of sorts. When you point a firearm at enemies after downloading the 1.3 patch, you’ll notice that they might lay down their weapons and surrender rather than tangle with Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dying Light was always about reactivity and making the world respond naturally to your every move. After hearing your requests, we’ve introduced a new human-enemy behavior – melee-weapon enemies will now recognize when you’re aiming a firearm at them and might decide to surrender rather than losing their life. Depending on your actions then this scenario can unfold in a number of ways, but we’ll leave them to you to discover.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team has also added nine new weapon execution animations, covering every type of melee weapon in the game.</p>



<p>Call of the Beast continues, and the campaign has moved on a notch with fresh challenges. As a collective, the community needs ot land 10 million shots to secure an exclusive car skin, and 20 million to unlock a limited edition rifle. This new challenge runs from today until next Thursday.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <strong>Dying Light: The Beast x PUBG Mobile </strong>crossover event kicks off tomorrow. You need to access the Dying Light Outpost page and activate the quest, which will trigger an event in-game that hands you a new quest. Once you’ve completed this quest line, you’ll have unlocked stacks of PUBG Mobile-themed items.</p>

These sidekicks will be little pets that follow you around and do emotes and "react to the world around you," according to Epic.</p><p>The first sidekick will be a banana dog called Peels, which will be included in the Simpsons battle pass that launches November 1. Three more sidekicks will hit the item shop on November 7, including Bonesy the dog, which was on a pet back bling in a battle pass years ago in Chapter 1. Folks who have the original Bonesey back bling will receive the new sidekick version of Bonesy for free. We have no information about pricing yet.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949"></a><figcaption>Take a look at the first wave of Fortnite sidekicks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg"></figure><p>While all this sounds cool, there is a monkey's paw component to sidekicks as well. Each sidekick is customizable, but you can only design the way it looks--meaning the color of its skin, scales or fur, or whether it has horns, and other physical characteristics--a single time. If you want to make one that looks different, you'll have to buy a new copy, seemingly at full price. The idea with this is that each critter you design is a unique being. But there are other ways to customize your sidekicks without paying more. You'll unlock accessories for your sidekicks, like little hats and shirts, by running with them in the game. </p><p>Meanwhile, November 1 also marks the start of a month-long Fortnite x Simpsons event, which will take over Battle Royale with a new Springfield-themed island and a battle pass that includes Marge and Homer Simpson skins. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">There will be a live event on Saturday morning</a> to introduce the Simpsons collab, before the season begins on Saturday evening.</p>

                <p>Halloween is upon us, and Google is serving up a blast from the arcade past with a special 45th anniversary edition of Pac-Man. The game is fully playable right on the homepage, with our yellow hero having traded his usual neon maze for something a bit spookier: Eight eerie levels, including four haunted houses that each mirror the personality of their ghostly resident. </p><p>When Pac-Man first hit Japanese arcades in 1980, it was an instant cultural phenomenon. Designed by Toru Iwatani and inspired by a pizza missing a slice, the game stood out in an era dominated by space shooters. Its simple premise--gobble dots, dodge ghosts, and clear mazes--quickly became addictive fun that crossed borders and generations. The ghosts even had their own personalities and names (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), setting a new standard for character design in gaming. </p><p>Last Halloween, Google took <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blast-ghosts-and-even-the-haunted-sun-with-this-years-halloween-google-doodle/1100-6527487/" data-ref-id="1100-6527487">mascot Momo the cat on a space adventure</a> where you had to take on ghosts and even a haunted sun. Google's interactive Doodles already has an impressive lineup, from the <a href="https://doodlecricket.github.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cricket match Doodle from 2017</a>, where you play as a cricket, to the <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coding for Carrots game</a> that let kids learn programming basics through a hopping bunny. Now, Pac-Man gets to join them in his tricky treat adventure. </p><p>You don't need a console or a quarter to play, just head to Google's homepage and click on the Doodle banner, then press start. The special Pac-Man Doodle will be live for 48 hours only, so grab your virtual candy bag and get ready to chase (or be chased by) some ghosts.

Now, without warning, the Big N has shared the front cover of the very first issue of Nintendo Power <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-GB/contents/21871a54-69d3-4bb0-a029-5b9402dfe18d">on the app</a>.</p>
<p>Well... this is very cool and unexpected, and comes with basically no fanfare or reason. Not that Nintendo <em>needs</em> a reason. But hey, it's cool art of Mario and Wart from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>.</p>
<p>This cover is from issue No.001, which is the July/August 1988 issue. 3.6 million copies of this particular magazine were published.</p>
<p>We're assuming this is going to be a regular thing which is a really nice idea — we'd <em>love</em> if you could read snippets from the old mags on the app, but hey, we'll take some clean art. There's always the <a href="https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20001%20%28July-August%201988%29/page/n19/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Other games featured alongside the second Mario Bros. game to release in the West are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> (The Second Quest isn't Zelda II, don't worry) and <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>.</p>
<p>Nintendo Power was one of the longest-running magazines in North America and Canada, and it ran from 1988 to 2012 (under Nintendo of America's hand). A podcast headed up by former Editor-in-Chief Chris Slate ran from 2017 to 2023.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-reportedly-cancelled-again-amidst-amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-layoffs.1339423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst a massive layoff at Amazon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">which cut 14,000+ employees</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">killed further development of New World: Aeternum</a>, has also reportedly killed (for a second time) the Lord of the Rings MMO that was in production at Amazon Game Studios.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, a now former Amazon Game Studios senior gameplay engineer, Ashleigh Amrine, confirmed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">in a post on her personal LinkedIn page</a> that the "<em>fledgling Lord of the Rings game</em>" was part of the cuts at Amazon.</p>



<p>"<em>This morning I was part of layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (ya'll would have loved it),</em>" Amrine writes. "<em>It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this - I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here</em>."</p>



<p>Amazon has yet to officially confirm that its Lord of the Rings game, which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/">already been cancelled once before due to a contract dispute with Tencent</a>, has been cancelled again now as part of these layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/">after it was revived in 2023</a>. </p>



<p>When it was confirmed that further development on New World had ceased, we reached out to Amazon for a comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. But Amrine's statement here, compounded with the statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch and games, seems to confirm what we already suspected, that we will not see a new Lord of the Rings MMO anytime soon.</p>



<p>Boom called the cuts to Amazon Game Studios "<em>significant</em>" and specifically called out MMOs as a genre in which Amazon is halting first-party development work.</p>



<p>After the MMO was revived for the first time in 2023, we also learned it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/">built on a next-generation version of the engine </a>that was used to develop New World. A little more than a year after its revival, Amazon Game Studios boss Christoph Hartmann stated that the Lord of the Rings MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/christoph-hartmann-says-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-still-early/">was still in "<em>early</em>" stages</a>, which made sense given that production had only picked back up a year prior.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that early status also means it makes sense for Amazon to cut its losses without hesitation, as it was unclear how much work from the previous iteration of the game would be picked up following its first cancellation, and it might've been starting from scratch.</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Amazon does make a more official comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. For now, though, don't hold your breath on it being shown off at a future Summer Game Fest or similar event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Once Upon a KATAMARI Review - Ureshii Matsuri]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-upon-a-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri.1339420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s no hyperbole attached when announcing an opinion as potentially outlandish as “<em>Katamari </em>is possibly the most joyful series of games ever made”. Forget the horrifying implications of what happens to the Katamari, and the King’s true power, just roll away your troubles until the land beneath you attaches to your goals. In all honesty, thank The King of All Cosmos for <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>.</p>

<p>This is the latest release in the saccharine series, developed by the brand new Japanese studio RENGAME, and the first console release since 2011’s <em>Touch My Katamari</em> for the PlayStation Vita. You follow the typical adventures of The King of All Cosmos and the 5cm Prince (and his many, many cousins). Once again, the King’s silly escapades have caused untold destruction to the surrounding Solar System. While you run around at the King’s command, the King and Queen find themselves in awe of the culture they imbibe through your travels.</p>

<p>If you’ve never played a <em>Katamari </em>game before, you’re doing yourself a disservice to what is a fascinating balance of serenity and stress. A Katamari ball has the distinct property of being able to roll up anything smaller than its current diameter, with the game typically throwing you into a very messy environment to expand. In <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, it’s up to you to roll a Katamari big enough to fix those issues, only this time, we’re going through time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right, <em>Katamari </em>has entered the time travel entry of its franchise! Over 9 periods, the Prince is tasked to aid individuals all the way from the Stone Age to the current, all of whom, surprisingly, already know of the King and his deeds. Seemingly reverent to a world he’s shown irreverence towards in the past, the King will task you to help those to understand the Katamari – not just Katamari, but <em>Katamari Damacy</em> in general.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a very introspective entry in the series, even more so than <em>Katamari Forever</em>. While not explicitly playing on a best-of framing – a common sin for many <em>Katamari </em>titles in the series – what is drawn up for the player is a host of varied challenges, the usual Cousin collecting, and quirky commentary from the King throughout. What follows is an honest, brisk, and otherwise beautifully rewarding experience.</p>

<p>Everything in this game, from the levels, to the challenges, to the cousins, to the cutscenes, to the music, to the costumes, to the simple exiting of the game, feels like a “thank you” from RENGAME and co. It’s par for the course for your average <em>Katamari </em>experience, but with <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, so much attention has been paid to how the franchise runs parallel to the story’s own history. On top of that, RENGAME has expanded on what that franchise and history mean to the player collectively.</p>



<p>The level design is much more packed and claustrophobic in the initial stretches, compared to previous titles. Maybe it’s due to the King of All Cosmos’ newfound empathy, but a lot of levels will see you bumble and buzz around busy and bustling streets and markets, rarely engaging in the series’ past of continent-swallowing snowballing. For what it’s worth, the pacing is <em>g l a c i a l</em>, which can be a deterrent for some.</p>

<p>It was for me at first, eagerly awaiting the first time a city would face my adhesive wrath, but <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI </em>sidesteps this with gimmicky challenges, similar to <em>We Love Katamari</em>. You’ve got the usual rolling up specific classes of objects, and the ever-so-gluttonous food challenges, but you’ve also got very well-hidden collectibles, in the form of new playable Cousins, cosmetic items, and Crowns.</p>

<p>Crowns are tied to in-game progress, so they do become a necessity over time, but the game offers so much bite-sized content that roadblocks rarely ever feel impassible. Of the several dozen levels available, these roadblocks only ever come at a time when the progression has already branched out multiple times. Sure, you’ll come across a dud of a challenge more than once due to the sheer amount and variety of them, but there’s so much killer on display here.</p>



<p>There’s also “KatamariBall”, a frankly standard quirky multiplayer mode which involves collecting several items, and depositing them in a continuously-moving checkpoint. It feeds into the chaotic nature you’d usually find yourself in while playing a multiplayer Katamari experience, but this is the first time where it falls mechanically flat. The brevity of it all leads to confusing situations that don’t even feel adequately explained, even when The King of All Cosmos is cheering you on.</p>

<p>Still, I found myself chomping at the bit to grow bigger, larger, fighting Kaiju and ripping volcanoes from the crust, but contextually, it started to come around. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> doesn’t want to focus on the scale of the series, but the sensation. How it feels to roll down a hill and be unable to be stopped by the most rooted obstacle, the perturbed looks from passersby, feeling like the first time, every time. In this instance, it succeeds, more than once.</p>

<p>It helps that the King’s once booming and pragmatic commentary has now softened to a more explorative soul. Whereas his past experiences saw him bitter, almost disgusted at many of your misgivings, the nature of the game has changed a lot since we last saw him 15-odd years ago. His chronicles adventures of Edo Japan throughout, see an individual fascinated by the world he’s destroyed, so many,&nbsp;<em>many</em> times, and The Queen’s partaking of era-adjacent activities are also full of reverberant life.</p>



<p>It’s easy to say “this is the best <em>Katamari </em>has been in a while”. The series has seen so few new entries in the years past, the first two titles’ remakes being the most prominent that many new players have seen. With that said, <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>’s genuinely affecting reflections and presentation leave it in a position where, truthfully? This feels like the new benchmark.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Once Upon a KATAMARI&nbsp;</em></strong>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>While Keita Takahashi’s hand has not been involved in <em>Katamari </em>for a while, it’s easy to see that his ethos hasn’t dissipated since <em>Katamari Damacy</em>’s release, 21 years ago. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> isn’t just a celebration of Takahashi and co. 's work, but a celebration of the human exercise of collecting. History and humanity hand in hand for a homely, happy time, and readily available for newcomers and veterans alike.</p>

<p>What a vibe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The anticipated The Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon Games might have been canceled. At least, that’s what a former employee’s post on social media would suggest.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on LinkedIn, a former developer confirmed that they had been laid off from Amazon Games and specifically mentioned The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p>



<p><strong>“This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),”&nbsp;</strong>the post read. <strong>“It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here.”</strong></p>



<p>While that doesn’t outright confirm the game’s been shelved, the wording used in the post strongly suggests that’s the case. On top of that, sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are also of the belief that the game isn’t going to move forward, with one saying that the game is “likely done.” However, they wouldn’t outright confirm that it’s completely dead due to the IP involved.</p>



<p>Neither Amazon Games nor Embracer has responded to multiple requests for comment on the claims from the former employee along with what sources have said.</p>



<p>If this is the end for the MMO from Amazon, it likely won’t be the end for The Lord of the Rings as a video game franchise. Insider Gaming recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that a new third-person action game</a> is in development with investment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. </p>

This collection includes classic Resident Evil games that have gone through the GOG preservation program, ensuring that they'll be compatible with modern PCs. Normally $60, the bundle is on sale for $27, a massive 55% discount.</p><p>The Resident Evil Classic Bundle includes the first three mainline games, Resident Evil HD Remaster, and the prequel Resident Evil 0. Like other GOG releases, each game in this package is DRM-free, and numerous improvements have been made to each one. Alongside updates to make them compatible with modern Windows operating systems, the games include several language localizations, new graphical rendering options, controller support, and cloud save support.</p><p>These older Resident Evil games also had several game-breaking bugs, but GOG has worked to fix them up. As for the games, the Resident Evil series introduced a new standard for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival-horror</a> when the franchise kicked off in 1996. The first game was set in a creepy mansion infested with bioweapons that had broken free from containment, setting the stage for the signature action and puzzle-solving gameplay that the series became known for. Resident Evil 2 expanded on these ideas as the Umbrella Corporation's experiments transformed Raccoon City into a warzone, and Resident Evil 3 introduced the infamous Nemesis, a seemingly unkillable monster that would stalk players.</p><p>Resident Evil 0 was set before the main trilogy, and it details the events aboard the Ecliptic Express that eventually led to the Spencer Mansion outbreak. In 2002, the first Resident Evil received a remake for the Nintendo GameCube, and this version was later remastered and released on several platforms. Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil HD Remaster were also recently added to GOG, and both games have been updated with new stability patches.</p><h2>Resident Evil Classic Bundle</h2><figure

                <p>In September, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/" data-ref-id="1100-6534611" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-patent-could-reshape-the-future-of-pokemon-inspired-games/1100-6534611/">granted a US patent</a> for "the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” within a video game. At the time, that was seen as an attempt to block any future Pokemon imitators like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768" data-mce-href="/games/palworld/">Palworld</a>. Nintendo went out for another Pokemon-inspired patent in Japan, but the outcome wasn't in its favor this time.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-been-denied-a-patent-in-japan-for-a-pokemon-like-capturing-mechanic/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-been-denied-a-patent-in-japan-for-a-pokemon-like-capturing-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Nintendo filed a Japanese patent for a mechanic in a game that allows the player to throw an item that captures a character, like the Pokeballs in Pokemon. However, the application was denied because a third party submitted evidence from Ark, Craftopia, Monster Hunter 4 and more to prove that the mechanic isn't limited to Pokemon games and that it already exists.</p><p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a> first noticed the rejection, and added that it's plausible that the third party was Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld. While that would make sense, it's conjecture for now. Pocketpair is still engaged in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/" data-ref-id="1100-6530182" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">a legal battle with Nintendo</a> over Palworld's alleged infringement on Nintendo's preexisting patents. That led Pocketpair to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/">remove Pal Spheres</a> and other features from Palworld that fell under the patents held by Nintendo.</p><p>In the aftermath of Nintendo's American patent last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-patents-are-often-used-in-bad-faith-says-dev/1100-6534773/" data-ref-id="1100-6534773" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-patents-are-often-used-in-bad-faith-says-dev/1100-6534773/">Michael "Cromwelp" Douse</a>, the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, noted that, "These types of patents are too often used in bad faith."</p><p>Nintendo still has the option to appeal the Japanese Patent Office's ruling, but it's currently unknown if the company plans to do so.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Out of nowhere, Nintendo has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> Switch 2 Edition, which will be an enhanced version of the Switch game. Original Switch owners will not miss out on too much, as Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be getting a free content update. Both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2 Edition</a> and the free update are scheduled to release on 15th January 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition &amp; Free Update – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition will feature enhanced resolution to improve the game’s graphics, which you would expect from this release. Additionally Joy-Con 2 mouse controls will be available to use to decorate and move items around, create custom designs, and write messages on the bulletin board. Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition gets a new item in the form of a megaphone and this can be used to call the other island residents using the Switch 2’s in built microphone. On the online side of things, up to 12 players can meet up in the Switch 2 version of the game, and that includes speaking with everyone on GameChat – local wireless is still limited to 8 players, though.</p>
<p>The free update that will come to both versions of Animal Crossing: New Horizons will add a resort hotel run by Kappn’s family, and your role is to help decorate the rooms to draw visitors to the island. Once a room is decorated you will get hotel tickets that can be used to exchanged for items in the hotel shop – it’s basically Happy Home Paradise DLC, but a free Hotel-based version.</p>
<p>Some amiibos will also be compatible and those characters can be invited as guests to the hotel. Legend of Zelda and Splatoon amiibo will be compatible with game, adding new items to the game. Tom Nook is getting on the action too, wanting to sell island goods to the visitors. That means you will need to find resources to craft these items and get hotel tickets in exchange for them.</p>

<p>A quality of life update within the overall update will allow players to increase storage capacity from 5000 items to 9000 items, and you will be able to store flowers. Resetti will be available to clear up items that you do not want on display, and they can be put in storage to reuse at a later date. The action does not stop when your character goes to sleep. When they hit the hay they can be transported to Luna’s dream world which takes players to Slumber Island. Slumber Island can be decorated in whatever you want, terraform the environment, add bridges, change the time and weather, and add residents. Players can have up to three islands and choose from small, medium, and large sized islands. Players can be invited to each other’s islands and work together on making changes. There will be additional crossover items including consoles, and those who have a Switch Online membership will be able to play games on those consoles. There is also a collaboration with LEGO which will bring LEGO items into the game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed that those who own Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch will be able to purchase an upgrade pack to the Switch 2 version and that costs £4.19 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">according to Nintendo’s store</a>.</p>

		<p>Back in May, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/mount-blade-ii-bannerlords-war-sails-content-has-been-delayed/">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord’s War Sails content was delayed</a> as more time was needed to develop and polish the features. Today, the wait for War Sails is almost over with TaleWorlds confirming that the new content will be available from November 26th for PC and consoles. To mark this announcement, a new 15 minute gameplay showcase has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Gameplay Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHYUAk6zn2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase features gameplay of the Southern Empire engaging in a battle with the Aserai in waters both claim as theirs. The full features of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord War Sails include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>MEET THE NORDS: Chart a course to the Northern Kingdom, home of the fearless</em><br>
<em>Nords. Trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Will you join the</em><br>
<em>North or take their riches?</em></li>

<em>battles. Master wind and water physics, board or ram ships, cripple foes by shattering</em><br>
<em>oars, sinking hulls, or tearing sails.</em></li>

<em>sea, islands, rivers, and open waters. Sail past barriers, resupply, and battle foes on</em><br>
<em>land and sea.</em></li>
<li><em>BUILD YOUR FLEET: Choose from 18 ships, each with unique handling shaped by</em><br>
<em>wind and waves. Upgrade with siege engines, sails, and rams. Acquire vessels, upgrade</em><br>
<em>ports, or win ships and figureheads.</em></li>
<li><em>EMBARK ON A NAVAL CAMPAIGN: Sail rivers and seas to strike deep into enemy</em><br>
<em>land. Keep armies supplied, sink foes, and blockade towns. But beware—storms and</em><br>
<em>attrition can undo even the best-laid plans.</em></li>
<li><em>EXPAND YOUR ARSENAL: Gather new companions, Nordic banners, hairstyles,</em><br>
<em>tattoos, and armour. Develop your naval skills, craft unique weapons, and wield new</em><br>
<em>spears, swords, and axes to rule land and sea.</em></li>
<li><em>A LIVING, EVOLVING WORLD: Naval systems and Nord faction integrate into</em><br>
<em>Bannerlord’s world, reshaping trade, warfare, and diplomacy.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/22/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review/">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord Review</a></h2>
<p>In our review for Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord Jim said,&nbsp;<em>“My return to Calradia wasn’t entirely jubilant, though Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord is a game I’ll likely stick with, simply due to my love of the original. A wealth of new systems and activities help this sandbox strategy sim feel more alive than ever, though the busywork required to get anywhere can feel like a grind. Overall, existing fans will rejoice while newcomers may look on unimpressed, unsure what all the fuss is about.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="04693f01a55cc"><a title="Ash Pokemon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/04693f01a55cc/ash-pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been dealt a bit of a legal blow in Japan as the Patent Office has rejected an application relevant to the company's ongoing case against Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>
<p>This patent is related to monster catching à la <strong>Pokémon</strong>, but it's not quite the same one filed in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">US reported on back in September 2025</a>. This one appears to be linked to the act of throwing and aiming objects to either capture a creature or initiate a battle.</p>
<p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/">GameFray</a> reports that the patent in question (which is pending application no. 2024-031879, so not <em>specifically</em> one of the Palworld applications, but related) has been rejected as the application lacks an inventive step, determined after looking at "prior art", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ark_ultimate_survivor_edition">ARK</a> mentioned as a specific example.</p>
<p>The Notice of Reasons for Refusal, dated 22nd October 2025, states (via machine translation) that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field."</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b2b3ab4a171a"><a title="Palworld Catching" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b2b3ab4a171a/palworld-catching.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What catching Pals used to look like in Palworld — <em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Evidence submitted against the application includes a video from ARK of <a href="https://youtu.be/Kj0VKPqSByA?si=p1u8CF_Dlw8jnutT&amp;t=143">a character throwing a pod-like item</a> at the ground, and at other creatures, and aiming with a blue crosshair, and a list of tools from the survival game that can be used in-game, including an arrow that can be used to stun another creature.</p>
<p>Other games mentioned for comparison are manuals, tutorials, and Wikis for <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/craftopia">Craftopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/monster_hunter_4">Monster Hunter 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>, and the free web browser game <strong>KanColle</strong> (also known as Kantai Collection).</p>
<p>While the rejection is non-final — meaning Nintendo can resubmit their application with modifcations — it also shares a parent with <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en">JP7493117</a> (which focuses on character movement, collision, interaction, and throwing creatures at one another to initiate battle) and is the parent of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en">JP7545191</a> (which is the aiming to catch or battle in a virtual space) both of which <strong>are</strong> crucial to the main Palworld case.</p>
<p>As GameFray notes, if one member of a patent family is faced with issues, it can often highlight other problems with the rest of the group. Plus, judges often respect the decisions made by patent examiners. So we'll have to see what Nintendo's response is.</p>

<p>With the wider Palworld case, proceedings are still ongoing. Nintendo first filed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-and-pokemon-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-developer-pocketpair">a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair in September 2024</a> which "seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights."</p>
<p>Since the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/palworld-developer-pocketpair-changes-pokemon-like-summoning-mechanic">Palworld has changed its Pal catching and summoning mechanic</a>, which Pocketpair has gone on to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pocketpair-recalls-depressing-day-nintendo-announced-its-palworld-lawsuit">speak about</a> with disappointment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/palworld-dev-announces-disappointing-game-changes-resulting-from-nintendos-lawsuit">a number of times</a>. But the developer is still considering <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/forget-the-lawsuit-pocketpair-says-palworld-on-switch-2-is-100percent-worth-considering">bringing the game to Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders is out today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but more importantly for PC players, Embark Studios' latest arrives with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex. Furthermore, if you have an RTX 50 Series graphics card in your PC, then you'll be able to multiply the frame rates you see in ARC Raiders by an average of 3.6X, even when playing at 4K.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now/">According to NVIDIA</a>, when playing ARC Raiders on an RTX 50 Series card, with DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation while also using DLSS Super Resolution, you can "<em>multiply performance by 3.6X on average at 4K, with game settings maxed and ray tracing enabled</em>."</p>



<p>With an RTX 5090 in your machine, at 4K with the settings maxed, you'll be able to reach 420 FPS, and with an RTX 5080, over 300 FPS. An RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will let you reach 260 FPS and 220 FPS, respectively. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, lowering the resolution to 1440p or 1080p will boost your frame rates even further, with an RTX 5090 hitting over 500 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Super Resolution enabled for ARC Raiders, with all settings maxed out, at 1440p. Even if you're sporting an RTX 5060, you'll be able to hit over 190 FPS at 1440p, and up to 245 FPS at 1080p.</p>



<p>Even with a laptop RTX 5060 graphics card, at 1080p, you'll be able to reach 240 FPS, and if you have an RTX 5090 laptop graphics card, you'll reach 423 FPS at 1080p. A laptop RTX 5090 will also be able to reach above 300 FPS while playing at 1440p.</p>



<p>Along with ARC Raiders, there are a few other titles adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield 6's new Battlefield REDSEC</a> battle royale mode, Duet Night Abyss, and Directive 8020. It was also just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">AION 2 will arrive in 2026 with support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-sails-the-naval-expansion-for-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-is-out-on-november-26.1339375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer TaleWorlds Entertainment has confirmed the release date of War Sails, the upcoming expansion for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>



<p>War Sails was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally scheduled to launch in June</a>, though it was ultimately delayed by TaleWorlds. The expansion is now set to go live on November 26 at 00:00 Pacific Time, 03:00 Eastern Time, 09:00 Central European Time. It will be a simultaneous release on PC and consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X). Pricing has been confirmed to be $24.99.</p>



<p>The announcement was paired with an extensive gameplay showcase that demonstrated the expansion's main features. Players learned that a Custom Naval Battles mode will be available to instantly create and command fleet engagements on River, Coastal, or Open Sea maps. This mode is a great way to test tactics, experiment with ship setups, or jump straight into action without campaign progression. The naval warfare was inspired by historic medieval battles and will require players to master the physics of wind and water. Boarding and ramming ships, as well as crippling enemies by shattering their oars, sinking their hulls, or tearing their sails, are all viable tactics.</p>



<p>War Sails also adds the Northern Kingdom, home to the fearless Nords. Here, players will trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Of course, this also means that Calradia has been expanded to include a northern sea, islands, rivers, and open waters, with players able to sail past barriers, resupply, and engage in combat on land and sea.</p>



<p>At launch, players will find 18 ships to choose from, each with unique handling characteristics influenced by wind and waves. Ships can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. They can be purchased or captured, and ports may also be upgraded. </p>



<p>In War Sails, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord will get to sail rivers and seas to strike deep into enemy territory. It'll be pivotal to keep the armies supplied, sink enemy ships and blockade their towns, while keeping an eye out for stormy weather.
