Perhaps even excess. Before I finish a game, or sometimes even start it, the developers are already releasing free updates ranging from new quality-of-life settings to full-blown content add-ons. Each one makes the game worth revisiting and adds to the pull of picking it up for the first time. Here are six great games that recently added free stuff.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,195618,196358" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h5"><a id=""></a><em>Sea of Stars</em></h2><p>Released last year as a retro-style, turn-based RPG inspired by the greats like <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*1o83mup*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTc4NjQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*1o83mup*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTc4NjQuNjAuMC4w">Sabotage Studio’s </a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165"><em>Sea of Stars</em></a></span><em> </em>got a major upgrade in September.

A paid<em> Throes of the Watchmaker</em> expansion is coming in 2025 that adds a new area and dungeon to explore. </p><h2 id="h6"><a id=""></a><em>Blasphemous 2</em></h2><p> The Game Kitchen’s sequel to its first 2D side-scrolling Souls-like did not disappoint. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blasphemous-2-review-metroidvania-soulslike-platformer-1850767035?_gl=1*1krk5t7*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTkyODAuMjEuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blasphemous-2-review-metroidvania-soulslike-platformer-1850767035?_gl=1*1krk5t7*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTkyODAuMjEuMC4w"><em>Blasphemous 2</em></a></span> was one of 2023's great games, introducing new weapon-based playstyles and putting an emphasis on exploration that pushed it much more in the direction of being a proper Metroidvanaia. The free <em>True Torment</em> update arrived alongside the paid <em>Mea Culpa </em>DLC in October. It added new game+ mode with difficulty modifiers, more enemies, abilities, a Labyrinth of Tides challenge, and expanded zones with better connecting areas to streamline backtracking. The way the new game+ mode was structured has been controversial with fans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2114740/view/4479486532875452519&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2114740/view/4479486532875452519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but changes based on that feedback</a></span> are due out before the end of November. </p><h2 id="h7"><a id=""></a><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></h2><p>2022's<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a></span> is one of the defining beat-em-ups of the dcade, combining retro sensibilities with incredible pixel art animations and game feel. Kicking Foot Clan ass never felt so good, or so responsive. And somehow the game is still getting new free content. September’s paid <em>Radical Reptile </em>DLC added Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa—deep cuts from the ‘80s cartoon—as new fighters, but a free update alongside the expansion also added a Remix Mode that lets you battle with music  from guest artists including Jake Kaufman (<em>Shovel Knight</em>), Tomoya Tomita (<em>Yoshi’s Woolly World</em>), Sean Bialo (<em>Penny’s Big Bre</em>ak<em>away</em>), Button Masher (<em>Secret Levels</em>), Keiji Yamagishi (<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>), and Anamanaguchi (<em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>). It’s perfect for someone like me who’s still grinding out the platinum trophy on PS5. </p><h2 id="h8"><a id=""></a><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em></h2><p><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644">isn’t one of my favorite remakes</a></span> of a Square Enix RPG in recent years, but it gets the job done and is the only way to play one of the best old-school mech strategy RPGs around. In fact, it got a big boost in October from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399730/view/3994197038596461610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399730/view/3994197038596461610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free Mercenaries update</a></span> which added new maps, scenarios, and characters along with a separate mode in which you act as your own merc commander maintaining a squad of Wanzers to complete new missions. The other big part of the update is a local multiplayer mode that includes co-op and PvP skirmishes. I’d love a fully online version, but it’s still a neat novelty for hardcore <em>Front Mission</em>-heads.</p><h2 id="h9"><a id=""></a><em>Remnant 2</em></h2><p>Souls-like loot shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant II</em></a></span>’s final DLC arrived this autumn as well. While the paid <em>The Dark Horizon</em> expansion added new storylines and dungeons, the free update, out at the same time, introduced a boss rush mode for a more concentrated action experience. Cutting out all of the exploration, the new mode just throws enemies big and small at players and their co-op squads with the runs augmented by various buffs earned as they progress. It’s basically another roguelite mode with additional loot that rewards players for taking the punishment.</p><h2 id="h10"><a id=""></a><em>I Am Your Beast</em></h2><p>Most recently, the excellent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308">lo-fi shooter <em>I Am Your Beast</em></a></span>, which is kind of like <em>Hotline Miami</em> in 3D, just received a bunch of new levels via its free Support Group update on Friday. The new content offers players even more “extraordinary abilities” to overcome “extreme situations” across nine new levels. That’s a big addition given the base game only had 27. The short but punchy experience just got a little less short and a little more punchy. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, some will only work with PS5 Slim Edition, while others are for the older PS5 Digital Edition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> <em>Secret Level</em> trailer has been released. The upcoming animated anthology series, announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescom</a>, will be featuring an episode in Games Workshop's grimdark sci-fi universe. Specifically, the new trailer puts the spotlight on the Ultramarines.</p>



<p>In an official Warhammer-Community post, Games Workshop posted the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer. As the title implies, the trailer is a 40-second teaser of footage from the show set in the enduring sci-fi universe.</p>


<p><em>Secret Level</em> is an animated anthology series aimed at adults. It is being produced by the same creative mind behind another popular anthology series: Netflix's <em>Love, Death + Robots</em>. In addition to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the series will include episodes based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sifu</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for what is in that trailer, it appears to be a straightforward mission for the Ultramarines, the power armored enforcers the will of the Imperium of Man. The teaser is light on action, what little can be seen shows the Ultramarines fighting what appears to be a horde of human bandits. They even have <em>Mad Max</em>-esque gear and motorcycles.</p>

<p>The teaser also implies the episode may be an origin story for a named character. There's a brief scene of a young man covered in blood staring at the camera in the rain. All while a narrator voices dogmatic phrases of turning fear into loyalty. The face of the man even match cuts to an Ultramarine putting his helmet on.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer ends with the Ultramarine fighting something alien, his knife covered in glowing blue viscera, followed shortly by succession of rapidfire images.</p>

<p>Secret Level will debut on Prime Video December 10.</p>

<p>I saw a few people mark down STALKER 2 in the game’s earliest reviews because it’s ‘too difficult’. As a relatively casual gamer, I’m playing on STALKER 2’s easiest difficulty, and in almost 50 hours, I’ve died plenty – so it’s tough, but it’s an <strong>enjoyable </strong>kind of challenge.</p>



<p>That’s too much for some. In the last couple of days, dozens of mods have surfaced on platforms like Nexus Mods, many of which are aimed at making the game easier by scrapping some ‘troublesome’ features or toning down the difficulty of some more suffocating enemies.</p>



<p>It’s not the way The Zone is meant to be explored.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-giving-in">Giving In</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 isn’t supposed to be a cakewalk. You’re plunged into a near-post-apocalyptic environment overflowing with elemental anomalies and mutants out for your blood. Every two minutes, you’re hunkering down amidst a brutal gunfight between factions, and even trying to track down a stash or a hidden backpack could lead to an untimely death.</p>



<p>But that’s how it was designed – it doesn’t hold your hand too much, and that’s how fans like it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl?tab=popular+%28all+time%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Nexus</a>, STALKER 2 mods have already been downloaded more than 350,000 times.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the game’s fifth most popular mod turns down the difficulty of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists, some of the more finicky enemies in the game. As you explore The Zone, you’ll regularly brush up against both, but Bloodsuckers are much more common.</p>



<p>The next mod down the line removes weapon and outfit durability, which means you’ll never need to pay to repair your weapons in STALKER 2. It can admittedly get very expensive as you work your way through the game, but it’s also easy enough to earn money, so that shouldn’t be a problem for a gamer willing to <strong>try</strong>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got mods like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low Mutant Health</li>



<li>No Weight for Resources</li>



<li>Longer Sprinting</li>



<li>Unlimited Carry Weight</li>
</ul>



<p>If you spend a few minutes downloading STALKER 2 mods on Nexus, you’ll end up with a game that looks and runs a little better, but it’ll also likely be much easier – and that’s going to ruin the point of the game.</p>



<p>Do you think STALKER 2 is too tough? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The first FIFA game since the organization’s breakup from EA has officially been announced. FIFA and developer <a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Games</a> have revealed FIFA Rivals, a new mobile soccer game.</p>



<p>Launching in summer 2025 for iOS and Android, FIFA Rivals will be an arcade experience similar to that of the popular NFL Rivals mobile game. According to Mythical Games, FIFA Rivals allows players to create and manage their own clubs with the ability to level up and enhance their lineups as well as play with other players.</p>



<p>The game will be free-to-play and feature in-game transactions backed by Mythical’s Mythos blockchain.</p>

<p>The announcement of FIFA Rivals comes seven months after FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that a new “e-game” was being developed. While it’s not confirmed that this is the game he was referring to, it’s not the only gaming venture FIFA is involved with.</p>



<p>The organization <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fifa-partners-with-konami-for-the-fifae-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">partnered with Konami</a> to use eFootball as the official game for the FIFAe World Cup. There have also been continued talks between FIFA and Take-Two Interactive and 2K <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regarding a licensing agreement</a> in some from. There’s been no official update or announcement on where those talks stand or if they’ve happened, but Insider Gaming understands that they were ongoing as of summer 2024. What’s more, rumors have continued to circulate that FIFA would like to see a new console title released some time around the 2026 FIFA World Cup. </p>



<p>What do you think of FIFA Rivals being the first announced FIFA title for the organization after leaving EA and EA Sports?

<p>Bethesda Game Studios revealed months ago that a fresh and imminent update will allow players to assume control of Ghouls in Fallout 76. Far from being a simple cosmetic redesign, taking on the role of a Ghoul comes with several benefits and disadvantages that will make playing as a rotting, irradiated individual quite interesting indeed.</p>



<p>In a recent update, the team shared the unique abilities and perks coming to Ghoul characters, but until now, they neglected to say when they’d arrive in Fallout 76.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-longer-to-wait">A Little Longer to Wait</h2>



<p>Bethesda is rolling out the ‘Player Ghoul’ update in March 2025, alongside the game’s 20th season. On December 3, the 19th season of Fallout 76 will be deployed worldwide, bringing players more than two months of content, events, and special promotions.</p>



<p>In October, I broke down the idea of a Ghoul character in Fallout 76, listing the unique attributes, such as healing by radiation, that players following this path will be able to soak up.</p>



<p>There’s almost nothing in the way of becoming a Ghoul, either. If you’ve hit level 50, you’re free to transform into one, and at any point, you can switch back – just in case you don’t like the way it plays.</p>



<p>There’s still quite a while to wait, unfortunately. It seemed as though it was right on the horizon, but Bethesda Game Studios typically drags its feet when Fallout 76 updates are pending. At the end of the day, this is a live service game, and that means that it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’ll be worth it when it’s finally here. Are you going to play as a Ghoul in Fallout 76? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched into Xbox Game Pass, and many questioned how that decision might affect the game's sales. Now, that picture is coming into focus, albeit only somewhat.</p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lbk5alqhuk2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some key datapoints today</a> that speak to the effect of Black Ops 6 launching on Game Pass in the US. He said it led to a "subscription spending boost," as people opted to buy a Game Pass subscription instead of purchasing the game outright. Before this, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's launch on Game Pass drove the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">biggest single-day sign-ups for a new Game Pass launch of all time.</a></p><p>Piscatella added that Microsoft's decision to launch Black Ops 6 on Game Pass "shifted" the share of full-game sales to PlayStation. While Black Ops 6 might have helped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-xbox-is-call-of-dutys-most-popular-platform/1100-6527831/" data-ref-id="1100-6527831">Xbox become the most popular Call of Duty platform in a decade</a>, for full-game sales, PlayStation remains on top (again, at least in the US, according to Circana).</p><p>In fact, PlayStation platforms made up 82% of Black Ops 6's total console full-game dollar sales during October, Piscatella said. All roads lead back to Microsoft, though, as the Xbox company owns Call of Duty and makes money on every copy sold, regardless of the platform. An increasing share of sales on PlayStation benefits Sony, too, as the company takes its normal platform cut. Microsoft has promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-and-sony-reach-deal-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation/1100-6516010/" data-ref-id="1100-6516010">keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms for at least the next decade. </a></p><p>What's more, Piscatella said the data suggests launching Black Ops 6 on Game Pass did not result in a "massive cannibalization of sales" for the game. This has been an ongoing point of debate and discussion, and while some developers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">reported cannibalization effects for Game Pass releases</a>, others have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">observed different trends.</a> Piscatella said there is no definitive answer right now for Call of Duty.</p><p>"Who knows, maybe there's a benefit, maybe there's a drawback, maybe it all comes out in the wash. Whatever it is, the data suggest (to me anyways) that it ain't conclusive yet," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lbkegu2l5c2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piscatella said</a> in response to questions about how bringing a new game to Game Pass could affect game sales.</p><p>Before this, analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously admitted that with a former exclusive, Starfield, only releasing for console on Xbox was likely to result in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost unit sales.</a> The company said the same for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but whereas Starfield never came to PS5, The Great Circle is headed there in 2025.</p><p>Going back to Call of Duty, Piscatella also shared that Black Ops 6's launch did not provide a "significant boost" to Xbox Series X|S hardware. Xbox hardware sales dropped 18% during October 2024, which was better than the declines for PS5 (-20%) and Switch (38%).</p><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">no longer even necessarily trying to sell you an Xbox</a>, as the Xbox brand now means a lot more than just a box under your TV. That being said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">consoles remain incredibly important to Microsoft and the company is making more of them. </a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">economic realities of Game Pass may never become clear</a>, in part because Microsoft will not publicly share the terms of its deals with developers and publishers. At a higher level, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-microsoft-doesnt-share-xbox-one-sales-numbers/1100-6435219/" data-ref-id="1100-6435219">doesn't even disclose Xbox console sales numbers anymore</a>, as the company instead focuses on ambiguous "engagement" metrics that can be spun and positioned to Microsoft's benefit.</p><p>Black Ops 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/" data-ref-id="2900-5979">No. 1 best-selling game of October 2024 in the US</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 3 best-selling game overall after just a few days on sale.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-doing-a-fire-type-event-but-its-not-exactly-setting-the-community-ablaze<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning when I woke up I, like every other well-adjusted individual, immediately silenced my alarm and started Pokémon TCG Pocket to open my morning pack. Lo and behold, I discovered that a brand new event had been introduced to the game overnight. It's a "Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event." And it's. Fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This fire-type event seemingly came out of nowhere as a pleasant surprise today, and it includes a few different elements. There's a new set of Missions to complete with various rewards, all largely revolving around collecting certain fire-type Pokémon. There are new event-based Wonder Picks, including one that will let you select from five desirable fire-type cards and another that rewards either a fire-type card or currency. And there's a limited-time flair you can purchase for certain cards that gives them a fiery effect. Neat!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as it was to wake up to a surprise event, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gx188l/fire_event_is_now_live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaction</a> from the community so far is... lukewarm, to say the least. This is not the most exciting event! The mission rewards aren't amazing for one, and they require players to complete them with cards obtained during the event. So, for instance, one of the missions is to obtain an Arcanine ex card. I already have one of those. But that doesn't count, because I had it before the event started. So I have to obtain a second one during the event in order to finish the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining those cards is supposed to be easier due to the Wonder Pick options, but the hourly free Wonder Pick only has a smaller chance of actually getting a card instead of currency, and the other Wonder Pick that includes five different cards costs a whopping three stamina. For those who don't play Pocket: this means players either need to wait for very long periods of time to get a chance of obtaining the card they want, or they have to spend real money to roll the dice more frequently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, there's the event flair. It works how all other flairs work - you need to exchange a currency called Shinedust as well as an unusable duplicate of the card you want the flair on to obtain it. That means, for instance, if you want to obtain the event flair for an Arcanine ex, you need not one, not two, but <em>three </em>Arcanine exes sitting around, and then you can exchange the spare one for the flair. Sure, your chances of getting that Arcanine ex are higher thanks to the event Wonder Pick... but, oh, did I mention that the event only lasts five days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's admittedly hard to complain here, given that this was a totally unexpected event that really only gives players a few extra chances at some fire-type cards they might want. But in recent days, the Pokémon TCG Pocket community has been getting restless. Community members have been increasingly complaining that there's just not a lot to do after a certain point beyond waiting to open new packs twice a day. Some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters">inventing their own battle formats to pass the time</a>, but at the moment, event activities are the main form of entertainment in Pocket. The previous water-type event included a bunch of PvE battles with cards to earn from them, so the fire-type event not including something similar is a bit perplexing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, this seems more like a stopgap between the water-type event and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">upcoming expected new booster pack releases</a>. For now, we'll just have to keep opening packs while we wait for something new to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Because the moon theory was proved true for Trailer 1. Two months before Trailer 1 came out, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/excitement-for-rockstars-gta-6-reveal-is-sending-fans-to-the-moon">Rockstar released a GTA Online image that included the moon</a> in a phase (Waning Gibbous) that ended up corresponding with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-confirms-gta-6-trailer-1-release-date">the day Rockstar announced the release date of Trailer 1</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the start of November 2024, and Rockstar’s release of another GTA Online image, below, that - you guessed it - includes the moon in the Waning Gibbous phase. The real-life moon ends its current Waning Gibbous phase today, November 22, and from tomorrow moves on to the Last Quarter phase. And so, fans thought today would be the last possible day for either Trailer 2 itself or an announcement on when it would drop.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GTA Online Community Update</p><p>First details on an exciting new GTA Online update coming in December — featuring clandestine operations launched from the Darnell Bros.

With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later.

            <p>A little teaser story to end the week, care of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-21">Maw</a> reader MiniMatt. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> devs Wube Software have dropped the vaguest of hints about their next game project, or at least, shared one of their current inspirations: World Of Warcraft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The news comes in the shape of a <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-438">wrap-up article</a> about the Factorio Space Age expansion, which we think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorio-space-age-review">pretty decent</a>. There's a few paragraphs on player stats, bugs and the official soundtrack, and then, a brief aside on future projects.</p>
<p>"This is one of the most frequent questions I'm getting," writes developer Kovarex. "Well, I'm not really sure, but we are playing with different kinds of ideas for the next game. Will we figure out something worth doing? Maybe.</p>
<p>"To clear my head, and gather a little bit of inspiration, I decided to experience the Fresh <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> world for a while, you can find me in the Fresh server in the guild called Factory must grow," he adds. "The game I'm thinking about is related to WoW in a similar way as to how Factorio is related to Minecraft." </p>
<p>And there you have it. Told you it was brief. Yes, I am currently scrunching my eyes up and trying to solve the following quasi-mathematical equation: (factory builder/block builder) = (massively multiplayer RPG/???).</p>
<p>Let me know if you figure anything out. Many thanks again to MiniMatt, who also tipped us off about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dayz-creator-reveals-a-kerbal-space-program-killer-with-kittens-and-challenges-license-owners-to-sue-him">that spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program from the original creator of DayZ</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just a few months after its announcement, Rebellion has canceled its Sniper Elite Battle Royale game, Archipelago.</p>



<p>First announced in August 2024, Project Archipelago, internally known as Sniper Island, was a team-based multiplayer Battle Royale in which teams of three battled it out to be the last to survive. The game had its last Alpha playtests in mid-August 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game was canceled because Tencent decided not to continue funding the project. While we’ve not been able to pinpoint the exact reason, Rebellion higher-ups implied in meetings with staff that funding was pulled due to the disastrous launch of Firewalk Studios’ Concord, which caused Tencent to get skittish about some of its projects.</p>



<p>Archipelago’s announcement didn’t necessarily go down well with Sniper Elite fans, either. Its reveal was criticized on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulSkpVklx4&amp;ab_channel=Rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion YouTube channel</a>, with fans confused over Rebellion’s decision to move from single-player games to a Battle Royale. </p>



<p><span>It’s understood that despite the game’s canc</span>ellation, no one’s employment was affected, with staff being moved to other projects, including&nbsp;Sniper Elite: Resistance, its next mainline Sniper Elite game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Rebellion to comment before publication, but they declined to comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Winter Burrow Makes A Harsh Survival Game Awfully Cute]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/winter-burrow-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/winter-burrow-makes-a-harsh-survival-game-awfully-cute.1043127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/winter-burrow-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Winter Burrow </em>was announced in an Xbox showcase back in June, but it more or less promptly fell off my radar: while I love a survival game, especially one with snow, I’m not necessarily a “cozy” games fan. I will be 100% honest that it came back in front of me thanks to a press release about a new trailer this week, and I will be even more honest that this form of outreach did exactly what it was supposed to, because I then played the game’s Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a>, and it is extremely my thing.</p><p>In <a href="https://noodlecake.com/games/winter-burrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Winter Burrow</em></a>, you play as a tiny mouse who has returned to their remote childhood home to fix it up. There’s a lot of the usual stuff of survival games: hunger, stamina, and temperature meters to manage; items to forage and craft; a day/night cycle that means you need to be careful with your time. The “cozy” aspect comes through in the form of aesthetics; instead of crafting a coat out of the hides of slaughtered wolves like in my favorite game <em>The Long Dark</em>, you knit thick sweaters in your tattered armchair next to the fire.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Winter Burrow Developer Commentary | THE MIX Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2DWZHQnYAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The demo took me about 15 minutes and was mostly an introduction to the basics of the game, tasking me with repairing some items around the burrow and the surrounding world. That world is big and cold and challenging; I easily got lost in all the snow and rocks and froze to death with surprising frequency. On death, you drop your items and can retrieve them, but on a few occasions I had simply wandered too far and had to abandon my loot. Knitting a fuzzy sweater and pants helped me survive a bit longer, but they didn’t stop the cold from keeping me on my toes. Dread would fill me as my screen started icing over and I’d rush back to my burrow.</p><p>I know everyone isn’t a fan of this kind of survival game rhythm (or as prone to getting lost in games), but I love it. In many games, traversing the world is negligible, but I love games that use cold to make navigation such a present challenge, where surviving small jaunts out of your base feel like big achievements. This pace feels like it fits well with the fact that your character is a mouse, a creature that’s inherently tiny and vulnerable and always looks a bit outmatched. This made me appreciate the cozy aspects of the game; making a hot meal and nice clothes for a tiny mouse made me feel like I was taking care of a stressed-out pet, and gave me the same feeling as when I scrape together enough resources to make my character a hot cup of coffee in <em>The Long Dark</em>.</p><p>When the demo ended I groaned “nnooo…,” so now that I’ve followed its plot threads, I’m curious to jump back in and explore the world more. <em>Winter Burrow</em> is due to come out in 2025.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

the Show, new elements of Diamond Dynasty that will replace Sets and Seasons, and improved Franchise trade metrics and offseason play. The gameplay is also set for a bit of a refresh, with MLB 25 expanding on quick-time events, defensive AI, and updated pathing for more engaging gameplay in the moment.</p><p>We can expect to hear more about MLB 25 and what it will be bringing to the franchise in the lead up to its release, which can be expected around the start of the Major League Baseball season in March next year.</p>

		<p>It’s been real chilly, but that’s not the end of the world when your gaming PC can pump out enough waste heat energy to keep your gaming room warm, is it? Or maybe that <em>is</em> a sign of the end times…&nbsp;I don’t rightly know.</p>
<p>My PC’s actually been relatively silent this week, and my gaming in general rather limited. I did try to boot up Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but foolishly thought that would be possible on launch day, and haven’t managed to get back to it. That’s on my to-do list for the weekend, though, alongside checking out the Gran Turismo 7 PS5 Pro update.</p>

<p>We’ll start with <strong>Dom</strong> this week, who’s been playing a wide range of games out of Japan. There’s the adorable platforming of Astro Bot, the Persona-like JRPG-ing of Metaphor: ReFantazio, and he’s done a “let’s watch Eastenders from the start” with a fresh Final Fantasy XIV run. But the highlight of the week has been being able to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which he had a great time previewing ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/dynasty-warriors-origins-demo-launching-this-week/">the demo release</a>.</p>
<p>The big release of the week was STALKER 2, with GSC Game Worlds’ journey culminating in a game that <strong>Miguel</strong> found incredibly immersive and compelling. No, it’s not quite perfect and there’s a menagerie of oddities and bugs, but they didn’t really bother him that much while reviewing, and the devs new adventure is trying to patch as much of the problems out ASAP.</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> had a typically heady blend of different things as well. He’s enjoyed “the philosophically fascinating Threshold, the wonderfully scary Beyond Hanwell , the cosy Flock and cleared the extra trophies and speedrun levels on Astro Bot.” Add some Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership to that, though he’s found it a bit disappointing so far. Then again, he’s just managed to get some hammers.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> booted up his PS Vita for a play through of Tearaway, which “is still a fantastic experience that a lot more people should try and revisit.” <strong>Nic B</strong> might disagree, but he’s a complete reprobate and shouldn’t be listened to.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454706">Not Aran’s hands.</p>
<p>Now with around 40 hours in Phasmophobia, <strong>Gamoc</strong> is still surprised by how much he’s enjoying it, and has started to unlock some of the higher end gear to help. That’s been joined by some Rimworld, Necesse, and Noita.</p>
<p>The birthday boy <strong>Ade</strong> was lucky enough to get Super Smash Bros. and Bayonetta 3 for his birthday. “Super Smash Bros has been a massive hit (pun totally intended). My family and I enjoying unlocking a seemingly never ending roster of iconic characters. I’ve been enjoying Bayonetta 3 too, but seeing as I missed Bayonetta 2, the plot has me utterly bamboozled! Though, judging by my hazy memories of playing through the original game on PS3 and the sheer madness of <em>that</em> story, the bamboozling sounds about right!”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Jim</strong> sadly didn’t have&nbsp;“Dynasty Warriors: Origins being pretty great, actually” on his bingo card for 2025, so hasn’t won this week’s jackpot, but did enjoy the demo.</p>
