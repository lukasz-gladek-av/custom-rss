            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Reflector Entertainment has canceled an in-development project and laid off a number of staff following what it calls the "failure" of its first game.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Reflector CEO Herve Hoerdt says he's "made the decision not to greenlight further work" on a project that was in the "conceptualization phase", thus "terminating this development line". In layman's terms, that effectively seems to mean he's canceled an ongoing development project.</p>

<p>Hoerdt puts the cancellation down to the "failure" of Reflector's "ambitious and courageous first project", which he describes as a "new IP with a rich transmedia universe". He is, of course, referring to&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which is Reflector's first (and, to date, only) game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=E-CQpTRH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=Re1hIfMW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>wasn't a success for Reflector, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The CEO goes on to admit that&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"didn't come near the company expectations" with regards to sales performance, and that the world of the game doesn't "warrant any further exploration" as a result.</p>

<p>He says that the canceled project continuing "would not have been sustainable" for Reflector, but that it will result in "redundancies", although he doesn't state how many.</p>

<p>Going forward, Hoerdt says Reflector will work on a single project at a time, an approach that's also been espoused by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Rime&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Tequila Works</a> (although that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency" rel="nofollow">insolvency</a> puts the future of said project into question in that case).</p>

<p>Reflector is currently working on a game "based on an existing Bandai Namco IP", and Hoerdt says development on that project is "shaping up very well", although naturally, he doesn't say what it might be.</p>

<p>The company has also recently enjoyed success with fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, which managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">top three million sales in a single day</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>itself, you can, if you're so inclined, check out the action adventure game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477940/Unknown_9_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/unknown-9-awakening/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/unknown-9-awakening/9p486zcvt126" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

                <p>Activision has released a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gargantuan blog post</a> in which it responded to fans' ongoing concerns and criticisms about the state of Call of Duty, and one section confirms that the developer will temporarily scale back its content plans for Warzone as it aims to improve the game first.</p><p>In the blog post, Activision said it has made the decision to "prioritize focus on gameplay tuning, adding more quality of life, and addressing ongoing bugs." Because of this shift in focus, Activision said some of the new content originally planned for Season 2 "has been shifted to create bandwidth to address foundational issues." Activision did not specify what Season 2 content is being delayed, however.</p><p>Activision said it has numerous updates in the works for Warzone that aim to create the "most solid foundation" for the game. These updates will be released over time, and include gameplay adjustments such as reload speeds up to 20% faster for every weapon in the game. Activision is also reducing the penalty for sprint-to-fire from 35% to 10% and increasing the jump ADS speeds by 25%.</p><p>Additionally, the parachute cut animation has been increased so players can transition from cutting the parachute to getting into the action "significantly faster." Other updates include advanced UAVs now showing elevation arrows and the Spy Camera outline effect no longer rendering through walls.</p><p>Warzone is getting lots of bug fixes, too, including all of these listed below.</p><ul><li><h4>Map &amp; Gameplay Issues</h4><ul><li>Addressed visibility of dark areas and characters on Rebirth Island.</li><li>Addressed players being forced to stand up while reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed exploits allowing players to access unintended areas of the map.</li><li>Addressed parachutes deploying when jumping off ladders.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Weapons &amp; Equipment</h4><ul><li>Addressed weapons becoming inaccessible near interactable areas.</li><li>Addressed weapons falling through Buy Station models.</li><li>Addressed weapon tooltips appearing as common when dropped to the ground.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Perks &amp; Contracts</h4><ul><li>Addressed Ghost persisting through the prematch lobby into the match.</li><li>Addressed Cold Blooded not properly countering Tracker.</li><li>Addressed Quick Fix health regen not properly activating while plating.</li><li>Addressed Survivor preventing players from reviving downed squad members.</li><li>Addressed Most Wanted contracts not overriding respawn timers as intended.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Operators</h4><ul><li>Addressed Operator selection appearance issues in menu.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Finally, Activision said some of the issues with Warzone that players have reported in recent weeks may have to do with the integration of Black Ops 6's content into the game.</p><p>"We want to take a moment to reflect on the significance of Black Ops 6's integration--the largest in Call of Duty history--which, for the first time, has brought our teams and products together into a unified development environment," Activision said. "While this transformation has presented its share of obstacles, it also paves the way for more ambitious updates and closer collaboration in the future. We’re essentially laying a foundation to make new technology immediately available to all of our studios, improving development pipelines and the stability of porting features between titles, and allowing us to focus more of our time on future releases."</p><p>As for Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Activision is making some welcome changes as well, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-finally-let-players-disable-cross-play-for-ranked-play/1100-6528900/" data-ref-id="1100-6528900">finally allowing players to disable cross-play in Ranked matches. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Card battler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>has come back online in the US following an outage related to the shutdown of TikTok, and developer Second Dinner has promised changes in the future to avoid a repeat of the downtime.</p>

<p>The game was taken offline over the weekend after seemingly being caught up in a TikTok ban, which was rendered temporary when now-President Trump <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared a temporary reprieve</a> of 75 days for the social media platform. Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the outage was "a surprise" and that it "wasn't planned".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> shared on social media platform X today, Second Dinner confirmed the app was back online in the US, although it still <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881558007831740708" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem to be available</a> to download from mobile app stores.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the game's current publisher is Nuverse, a gaming-related subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance. Last year, ByteDance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bytedance-selling-gaming-assets" rel="nofollow">reportedly expressed interest</a> in selling off its gaming assets, which would naturally include Nuverse.</p>

<p>At time of writing, in-app purchases are <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881539047501484050" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently still down</a> within&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, but you can make purchases on the web shop. Second Dinner has <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previously stated</a> that it's "committed to ensuring that all players are compensated for their lost time" due to the outage.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a competitive card game currently available across PC and mobile devices. The game is described by its devs as a "fast-paced collectible card game that reimagines the genre with innovative mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's usually available on mobile devices as well, although reports suggest it's not downloadable on those storefronts right now.

            <p>Or months ago, maybe. I don't know and I have no time to check, because I'm playing the Steam demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-king-is-watching">The King Is Watching</a>. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-king-is-watchings-free-demo-turns-city-building-into-a-brilliant-balancing-act-of-feudal-surveillance">wrote about it</a> last year, but that was an older demo build. Things were different then, but the core of this minimalist city builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a>remains: you'll need to actively train your kingly eyes on your feckless underlings if you want them to do any work. Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research. Here's a trailer to help:</p>

<p>I'm actually starting to suspect I might have imagined the build I last played, since the trailer I used in the previous article shows the newer build. How far down does this thing go? Wait, nevermind. It's still <a href="https://hypnohead.itch.io/the-king-is-watching">on Itch</a>. Typical deep state shenanigans. First up, this version is much more visually lively than the previous. You can see your king now, and he's wearing a glorious golden face mask. This is just the demo king though - there looks to be more monarchs with more problems in the full release. Also new are prophecies that let you choose the next three waves that attack you, with more difficult enemies granting better rewards. Also, I think there are a lot more upgrades now. This is useless. I'm being useless. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry. Don't look at me, look at this helpful and attractive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/">Steam description</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sire! There are countless reports of peasants and workers sleeping on the job, not producing the bare minimum for the kingdom to operate! Only your watchful eye can help them understand the importance of working, for the good of the Kingdom! Your Royal Skill of balancing resource production, troop training, and magic guild is what will save our kingdom! Avert your attention to other royal matters, and production will stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>See, that was illuminating. I'll have worked out what's new and what's good by the time I end up reviewing this thing, promise. It's "coming soon" currently. The me is watching. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">State Of Videogaming 2025 report</a> that "some gamemakers hope <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."</p>
<p>Picked up by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-is-hope-that-gta-6-will-cost-as-much-as-100-says-analyst/">VGC</a>, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the <a href="https://x.com/Phant0mSl0th/status/1881476885252891029">extremely</a> <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1881519478674239986">polarised</a> mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive">aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation</a>, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">mass livelihood devastation</a>, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.</p><!--more-->
<p>Having quote-tweeted the VGC article with the caption "You're not supposed to say this out loud!!!!", Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881030119793299652">added</a> that "a good company raises salaries in line with inflation so that their staff don't die or something, but games prices haven't risen with inflation.</p>
<p>"This isn't the reason the industry is in the shit for now, but it is an uncomfortable truth," he went on. "On the other hand, the responsibility for a game developer is to make sure that the game they show lives up to that promise, and that investment from the player."</p><p>Another user objected that while GTA 6 might get away with such a hike, that's unlikely to be true of most games. "That is indeed the problem," Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881034274566242724">replied</a>, adding that digital distribution has long since done away with the checks on game availability imposed by brick-and-mortar retailers. "We are at a strange moment where retail is not defining output &amp; content, but now nobody is," he went on. "There's no standard. It's difficult to parse. It's 'the wild west'. The point is that perhaps Rockstar have enough clout to lay down the new law. And with that others will sink or swim?"</p>
<p>Douse offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">similar arguments last August</a> in response to the pricing of Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, commenting of a potential broad price increase that "everyone's just waiting for GTA6 to do it lol."</p>
<p>I bundled together a few thoughts of my own in that last article, which I will now summarise: yes, the cost/price ratio for games of GTA's scale doesn't seem healthy, but the people who benefit from price increases aren't necessarily the company's developers (let alone outsourcing teams in places with fewer labour protections), because a lot of the moolah naturally goes to investors. </p>
<p>Raising the upfront price could mean that publishers don't have to resort to other ways of monetising games, such as insidious or outright predatory microtransactions, but as Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881127198024953955">concedes</a>, it's unlikely publishers of $100 games would piously scale back on their monetisation, because publishers will always want to make more money. Whatever it costs to begin with, GTA 6 will doubtless launch alongside a new incarnation of GTA Online, with all the seasonal DLC elements you'd expect.</p><p>Wash that down with the tepid armchair anti-capitalist observation that the publishers of "triple-A" games have long since locked themselves into an understanding of their art that requires them to defy gravity. The fixtures and flourishes must always be shinier, more lustrous, more lifelike; the space must always be larger and richer with shows of technological investment; the numbers must always go up. The industry's commitment to generative AI, aka fancy automation software, is one of many efforts to get around the problem that you can only employ so many people to create productions of this scale, assuming it isn't an active attempt to butcher the workforce.</p>
<p>I suspect that quite a lot of developers, even those who are relatively senior at companies like Take-Two, would love to get away from this thinking, but the most vocal, if not largest portion of their audience now insist upon it, having been taught to think this way by years of marketing (and by years of video game press like myself broadly acceding to marketing's cultural priorities). Sometimes I think that the only way out of the jam is some kind of full-on industry collapse that performs a broad reset, though the more constructive option is perhaps <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5572/The-Videogame-Industry-Does-Not-ExistWhy-We-Should">to stop thinking in terms of "industries" full stop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Users were even able to wishlist the game on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inevitably, Sony pulled Grand Taking Ages VI from the PlayStation Store, but now it’s back on Steam after what its creators said were key adjustments made to convince Valve of the project's validity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/slop-1737462004799.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages is back, this time on Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Violarte told IGN that Grand Taking Ages had been through a “thorough” review process, and was now approved for publishing on Steam. On the Steam page are a brand new trailer and updated screenshots, all leaning on the parody angle its developer is using as justification for the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s changed? As well as ditching the “VI” in the game title, Violarte changed the game’s logo, descriptions, and overall presentation “to clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.” Gone is the art that looked a lot like Rockstar’s iconic GTA imagery, in its place art that looks a <em>bit</em> like Rockstar’s iconic GTA imagery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Grand Taking Ages is still riddled with generative AI. As per Steam’s AI rules, Violarte disclosed on the Grand Taking Ages Steam page that it used "AI services" for voice overs — and a cursory glance at the trailer will demonstrate how well this worked out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the new description on the Grand Taking Ages Steam page:</p><blockquote>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in mom's garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of "creative" deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into... a slightly better garage!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Violarte said it took a different approach with Valve to get the game on Steam than it did with Sony to get the game on the PlayStation Store. “We approached Steam differently by engaging with their team about the concept of our game before officially submitting it,” a representative told IGN. “This allowed us to get their perspective early on, ensuring alignment with their guidelines.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company pointed to other projects such as Grand Theft Hamlet, a documentary about two out of work actors who attempt to put on a production of Hamlet inside GTA Online, as evidence that parodies of GTA should be protected from takedowns. “These examples showcase how parody can celebrate and entertain within existing genres while remaining creative and engaging,” Violarte said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/slop-again-1737462058393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages uses generative AI for its trailer voice over.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Violarte now wants Grand Taking Ages back on the PlayStation Store. “We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store,” it said. To that end, Violarte said it had sent a request to Sony that points out that the changes it’s made to the game have convinced Valve to approve it for release on Steam. “We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented,” Violarte said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages's appearance on the PlayStation Store called Sony’s curation process into question, but Valve’s open-door policy on Steam is well-documented. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop, and, increasingly, generative-AI is being used to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-456-coming-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6435096/">as PS4 and Xbox One versions of Resident Evil 6 were released back in 2016</a>. The re-release came with all previously released add-on content, and in 2019, a Nintendo Switch version of the game was also released.</p><p>Resident Evil 6 is seen as the black sheep of the mainline franchise, as its attempt to be both a survival-horror and a survival-action game were met with mixed reception when it was first released in 2012. An over-reliance on distracting quick-time events and poorly executed scripted events did not sit well with audiences at the time, and over a decade later, the game still isn't fondly remembered.</p><p>Fortunately, Capcom's back-to-basics approach with the next mainline Resident Evil game helped kick off a new golden age for the franchise. Resident Evil 7 is still one of the scariest games in the series, while the remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 were praised for bringing the classic games into the modern era.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">The Resident Evil 4 remake earned a rare perfect score</a> at GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/">and Resident Evil Village received a highly positive reception</a> upon release.</p>

                <p>Epic's battle royale game Fortnite has introduced numerous licensed characters over the years, and the latest could be the classic Fox character Hank Hill from the animated series King of the Hill.</p><p>FNBRintel was first to report about the Fortnite X King of the Hill crossover that is said to be in the works, though a partnership has not been officially announced as of yet. King of the Hill was a popular show through its run in the late '90s and 2000s, and a revival of the show is coming to Hulu as soon as this year. As such, it makes a lot of sense that Hank could come to Fortnite in a cross-promotional effort.</p><p>Hank wouldn't be the first big Fox animated character to come to Fortnite, as Peter Griffin from Family Guy--the muscly version of the character, at least--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-peter-griffin-fortnite-leak-has-fans-thrilled/1100-6519637/" data-ref-id="1100-6519637">added to Fortnite in 2023.</a> Fox's most popular animated show, The Simpsons, hasn't had a Fortnite crossover as of yet.</p><p>Hank, voiced by Mike Judge, is the main protagonist of King of the Hill, which Judge created. Hank is a big fan of <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Strickland_Propane" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">propane and propane accessories</a> and <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Alamo_Beer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drinking Alamo beer with his friends.</a> He's a non-combative and subdued man, so it'll be interesting to see how he plays in Fortnite, if he is indeed coming.</p><p>Fortnite's latest crossover character is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">Godzilla, who is now in the game.</a> For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">everything you need to know about Godzilla in Fortnite.</a></p>

			<p>Everyone’s looking for an edge, and in gaming, that can come down to the tech and peripherals you surround yourself with. Thrustmaster are one of the most reliable and long-running peripheral-makers in the game, and control has always been their calling card. Their all-new HEART Controller pulls together a raft of their knowledge, with Hall Effect analogue sticks and mechanical buttons designed to make this the fastest, most precise weapon in your arsenal.</p>
<p>The Thrustmaster HEART Controller – H.E.A.R.T. standing for Hall Effect Accurate Technology here – is a USB-A wired controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC. There’s a lovely braided wired cable which connects to the controller via a standard USB-C port. It boasts the traditional Microsoft asymmetrical stick layout, and it’s a wholly plastic build, appearing in black and white, with an RGB lighting strip running across the middle. It looks smart, if a little understated.</p>



<p>In the hand, it’s a lighter offering than the official Xbox controller, though that’s not that surprising with no onboard batteries to contend with. The hand grips are a touch more angular at the end, and noticeably so when you pick it up, but once they’re resting in the palm of your hand they’re as comfortable as you’d hope.</p>
<p>The analogue sticks are the stars of the show, though. Hall Effect sticks use magnets to track movement rather than physical connections that can wear out and cause drift. You can tell Thrustmaster’s expertise here, and they feel tight and incredibly responsive in use. I’ve played a heap of Overwatch 2 and Marvel Rivals with them, and you feel empowered by these sticks, firing off salvos with pinpoint accuracy. Well, as much accuracy as your thumbs can muster, anyway.</p>

<p>The mechanical face buttons and cross-shaped D-Pad are also excellent, with a great tactile feel and reassuring click when used. The Y button on our review unit seemed to take a little while to bed in, but I’ve had no issues with it at all in the thirty to forty hours since.</p>

<p>Now onto the weaker elements: the shoulder buttons and triggers. Both of these inputs feel cheap in comparison to those on the front of the HEART Controller. Some of that comes down to the light plastic that they’re made out of, but equally, the shoulder buttons, and particularly the one on the right, feels, and sounds, cheap. The triggers are certainly as responsive as you’d want, but I really missed the ability to lock them out for playing FPS titles like you can with recent controllers like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Pro</a> – admittedly a significantly more expensive controller.</p>
<p>There are two additional buttons on the rear, and you can program these on the fly using the mapping button on the controller. They sit really nicely under the fingers, and I just like the way they feel. In fact, they’re much better to press than those found on Thrustmaster’s pricier <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">eSwap X2</a>.</p>
<p>The Mapping and RGB light buttons, though, are in the worst place possible. They sit above the Menu and Option buttons on the front of the controller and by doing so, they’re just where you expect to find the Menu and Option buttons. Every time I wanted to use either of the menu buttons, I found myself changing the lighting colour, or doing nothing at all. These absolutely needed to be placed somewhere else, and it seems unbelievable that no one else had the same issues with them during testing. I did mostly learn to live with it, but having to think about which one is the right button isn’t good for staying immersed in your game.</p>

<p>You can really tinker with the setup here though, whether on the fly – you can map the buttons and cycle through a small number of RGB lighting options via the buttons on the controller – or in the ThrustmapperX Software which is available on both PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>At £90, the Thrustmaster has to truly sell itself as being an upgrade over your regular Xbox controller, and though the analogue sticks, face buttons and rear buttons are well designed and feel great, the triggers and shoulder buttons just didn’t do it for me. In terms of competition, you’re one step away from Microsoft’s Elite 2 Core controller, but while it certainly feels more premium in your hand, there continue to be significant question marks about its reliability. I don’t think you’ll have any of those problems with the HEART Controller. If you want a wired controller for the reduced latency, that’s definitely a key selling point here, but if your budget will stretch to it, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2</a> is a far superior product, and you can now buy HALL Effect stick modules for it as well.</p>

The film became a global phenomenon, and is <em>the</em> shining artifact of the Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) golden age.</p><p>From the release of <em>Brink</em> in 1998 to <em>Camp Rock</em> in 2008, DCOMs were at their best over that illustrious decade. Why? Yes, they followed a standard cookie cutter formula. But it’s clear the producers and story creators were given a high degree of latitude (for better or worse) to throw crazy ideas at the wall and see what stuck. That’s a far cry from the sequel and IP-driven content we’re inundated with today.</p><p>True to its name (Disney Channel <em>Original</em> Movie), originality makes these movies memorable. If you’re a millennial who watched TV as a kid, there’s a solid chance you’re hit with a tidal wave of nostalgia at the mention of <em>Eddie’s Million Dollar Cook Off</em> or listening to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PowwTH4TmYA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PowwTH4TmYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DCOM theme song</a></span>.</p><p>In celebration of <em>High School Musical</em>’s final year as a teenager, we compiled a list of golden era Disney Channel Original Movies that are worth rewatching–for the laughs, tears, smash singles, memes, and WTFs.</p></div></div><div><p>There’s a common formula for DCOM sports movies: a protagonist with a passion; a pushy, emotionally dense (and often misogynistic) dad who doesn’t understand it; a secret the protagonist keeps from friends and/or family in pursuit of this passion; a pivotal moment where the dad finally understands and supports their child; and the hero achieving ultimate victory over the villain, made possible by their dad’s eventual support.</p><p><em>Brink</em> is the first DCOM to assemble these ingredients–making it the mother of all DCOM sports films–and it may have very well cooked the best dish out of them. Capitalizing on the massive popularity of Tony Hawk and extreme sports in the 1990s, the story centers around Andy “Brink” Brinker and his friends who deem themselves “Soul Skaters.” The SoCal squad is driven by their love of the game, which is why they find a natural rival in Team X-Bladz, a skate crew that shreds for money and fame. Val, the leader of X-Bladz played by Sam Horrigan, excels as the underhanded, detestable, and at times VERY unserious villain. In a heated confrontation, he tells the Soul Skaters, “It’s like open season on your butts.”</p><p>Much worse, he almost kills (yes, kills) Brink’s friend Gabriella when she speed races Brink down a huge hill. Val secretly tosses gravel onto the road, which she trips on and proceeds to slow-motion roll for 15 seconds of movie time. Ouch. It’s giving the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HNvsdwFnfc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HNvsdwFnfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricky Bobby-Jean Girard crash</a></span> in <em>Talladega Nights</em>, unironically.</p><p>The image that social media remembers most from this movie is when the camera pans to X-Bladz team member Boomer (Walter Emanuel Jones) after a standoff with Brink and crew, revealing his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@onlyninetieskidsknow/video/7217915556236758315?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onlyninetieskidsknow/video/7217915556236758315?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comically bad hairline</a></span>. But that’s not even the best Boomer moment! Later, Brink confronts Val about what he did to Gabriella while he’s eating lunch with the X-Bladz. After Brink throws a chocolate shake in Val’s face, Boomer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fn9oXl9tyG0?t=210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fn9oXl9tyG0?t=210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pulls a “Supa Hot Fire”</a></span> and switches sides, leaving with his former adversary.</p><p><em>Brink</em> is cornball, sentimental, and concludes with an epic race between Brink and Val. It lands all the right tricks and is definitely worth a re-watch.</p></div><div><p><em>Smart House</em> walked so <em>Black Mirror</em> could run. I’m being serious.</p><p>The iconic DCOM centers around teenager Ben Cooper (Ryan Merriman), who wins a contest to move him and his family into a new home dubbed “the Smart House.” It comes with state of the art smart technology, headlined by PAT, a virtual assistant that can make any food you want, write the school bully’s paper for you, create an i<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZktzLbnen8M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZktzLbnen8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mpromptu dance moment</a></span> to “Slam Dunk (Da Funk)” with your buddies, and throw the ultimate party to impress your crush. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Turns out, a lot.</p><p>As Ben’s dad slowly falls for the creator of the home, Sara Barnes (Jessica Steen), PAT becomes too smart for anyone’s benefit, and evolves into a sinister maternal figure. She comes to life as a hologram, and at one point locks and bolts the family into the home for their “protection.” In a truly terrifying scene, a giant-sized version of PAT appears in the living room, whips up a tornado-hurricane and eerily sings “Hush Little Baby” to the family. To make it creepier, that lullaby stems from a much sweeter home video of the kids’ (now deceased) mother doing the same. </p><p><em>Smart House</em> is a quarter of a century ahead of its time, and a cautionary tale for humans relying too much on technology to power their lives that still feels pretty poignant today.,</p></div><div><p>In the 1970s, a white South African named Mahree Bok (Lindsey Haun) girl goes to America to stay with a Black family as part of an exchange program and is surprised to learn that apartheid doesn’t exist there. You can’t help but cringe at the premise of <em>The Color of Friendship</em>, especially given that it’s a DCOM that was released in 2000. That’s what you’d be surprised by how Black director Kevin Hooks and Black writer Paris Quallers are willing to go all the way there by refusing to pull any punches in its effective depiction of race relations in this movie that’s based on a true story.</p><p>When Mahree arrives in America, she awkwardly refuses to shake hands with her homestay mom Roscoe Dellums (Penny Johnson Jerald), and laughs in uncomfortable hysterics when she meets her Congressman homestay father Ron Dellums (Carl Lumbly), shocked that someone in power can be Black. Through a series of events, which includes a young Black girl named Piper Dellums (Shadia Simmons) offering a self-sequestered Mahree food, the veil of Mahree’s ignorance slowly lifts, and the two realize they have a lot in common. One of the more impactful scenes features Mahree teaching Piper the various classifications for black people in South Africa. In it, the N-word is mentioned twice in a TV-G rated DCOM!</p><p>Shit gets really real when Steve Biko, an actual South African anti-apartheid activist, is killed by the police. Mahree responds: “Who cares? Just some crazy terrorist who killed himself.” Piper flips out, rightfully so, and Congressman Dellums teaches her about the vicious cycle of apartheid. It is then that Mahree understands how the system oppresses Black people and what the Black liberation movement in South Africa is fighting for.</p><p>Not your average Disney movie, huh?</p><p>Just look at <em>Remember The Titans</em>: Another Disney movie about desegregation in 1970s America that came out in 2000 and is based on a true story. Unlike <em>The Color of Friendship</em>, <em>Remember The Titans</em> stars one of the greatest actors ever (Denzel Washington), and is widely considered a classic. However, it’s impossible to ignore how Gary Bertier and Julius Campbell simply “solve” racism at a late night practice when they yell “left side, strong side” to each other. From there, racial tensions dissipate.</p><p><em>The Color of Friendship</em> ends with Mahree heading home to her racist parents in South Africa, revealing to the famly’s Black maid Florathat she secretly embroidered the Black liberation flag in her jacket. Racism isn’t solved. In fact, it’s very much still present and Mahree may find herself in danger if she expresses her new viewpoints.</p><p><em>The Color of Friendship</em> is the most un-Disney Disney movie on this list, which was perhaps made possible by being hidden away on the smaller screen. While the film does imply racism is a thing of the past in America, the way it demonstrates how ignorance is developed, educates young viewers on apartheid, and showcases the commonalities between all people (regardless of the color of their skin) makes <em>The Color of Friendship</em> a fascinating re-watch.</p></div><div><p>If you’re searching for a good-bad movie, <em>Luck of the Irish</em> is for you. It’s got basketball, lucky coins, evil leprechauns, good leprechauns, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZnZzbMRMjA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZnZzbMRMjA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slavery joke</a></span> (yikes), and a rendition of “This Land Is Your Land” performed by the entire school to put a button on this 86 minute-long roller coaster ride.</p><p>While the film is seemingly designed to celebrate Irish culture, its means for getting there are questionable. With Heritage Day approaching, the luckiest kid in the neighborhood Kyle (played by <em>Smart House</em>’s Ryan Merriman) asks his parents about their ancestry over dinner. They’re suspiciously dodgy, refusing to provide a straightforward answer. Meanwhile the walls of the dining room are painted a ludicrously green color, his dad dons a green flannel, and the salad his mom serves is one giant green lettuce leaf. Kyle really can’t take a hint.</p><p>When Kyle loses his lucky coin, his world turns upside down. His mom shrinks into a tiny leprechaun and assumes an accent, revealing their Irish heritage in the process. Why were his parents so keen on hiding it? Apparently, it’s because Irish people in America are oppressed. Were they oppressed? It’s unclear exactly.</p><p>One thing that <em>is</em> clear: <em>Luck of the Irish</em> is a pot of gold at the end of our DCOM rewatch list rainbow.</p></div><div><p>Based on Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night, </em>the film follows Andrea, a teenage motorcross enthusiast who secretly suits up as her injured brother Andy to pursue her motocross dreams. A tale as old as time.</p><p>Along the way, the best and hunkiest rider on the circuit, Dean, makes a deal with Andrea to help her improve on the bike in exchange for putting in a good word with his crush Faryn. Andrea then likes Dean, and after the final race, it is revealed that Andrea is actually pretending to be her brother. Sound familiar? Well, that’s because the plot is pretty much the exact same as <em>She’s The Man </em>with a different sport. Only, <em>Motocrossed</em> came first.</p><p>Watching the will-they-won’t-they dynamic unfold between Andrea and Dean (in a strictly heteronormative DCOM universe) is just as entertaining as any big jump on the bike. The sexual tension is palpable when Dean is training her and utters: “I’m gonna work you until you can’t get out of bed.” </p><p>Andrea outmaneuvering Cartier—the physically abusive French villain with a name that prevents you from ever forgetting he’s French—in the final race is espresso powder atop the creme brulee (we see you Zeke from <em>High School Musical</em>).</p></div><div><p>Eddie Ogden (Taylor Ball) is the Ken Griffey Jr. of the lowly Groundhogs little league team in this DCOM staple, and he’s got the backwards cap and lefty power swing to prove it. Unfortunately for him, his cooking and baking interest is which he is constantly derided for by his stereotypically browbeating Disney dad Hank Ogden (Mark L. Taylor) and best friend DB (Orlando Brown). In fact, during the second of two(!) food fights that occur, DB wrestles Eddie to the ground and yells “I’d rather play ball like a man than cook like a girl.” Sheesh. Eddie does find support from his mom and the home economics teacher Mrs. Hadley (Rose McIver), whose sarcasm and comedic timing rival that of a young Chandler Bing.</p><p>The biggest fork in the road moment comes when Eddie must choose between playing in the championship game and competing in the Bobby Flay-hosted cook off. He initially elects baseball but ultimately decides to bolt for the kitchen (with some coaxing from a supportive DB).</p><p>Amidst the insanity of the best hitter in the league taking his talents elsewhere, Hannah, the Groundhogs’ gold glove shortstop, is caught in the on-deck circle by her mom who had assumed she was cheerleading the entire time. Rather than ream her out for playing a “boy’s” sport on a “boy’s” team, she accepts Hannah, which causes Eddie’s dad to rethink his, er, bigotry. He intentionally gets himself thrown out of the game for arguing with the umpire and joins his son at the cook off.</p><p>Eddie winds up losing, but he wins something a lot more valuable: a dad who can show him how to crack an egg with one hand.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Ball knocks it out the park with a confident, charismatic, and surprisingly composed performance for a teenager called on to display a high level of physicality. Ball never became a big acting star because he apparently decided to leave the profession and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/benj_watch/?hl=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/benj_watch/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus on playing drums</a></span> for the band Tragic Forms. If you ask me, he pulled a real Eddie Ogden. </p></div><div><p>Riding the wave of the popularity of early aughts boy and girl bands like ‘Nsync and Destiny’s Child, <em>The Cheetah Girls</em> (and its sequels) contains some of the best music you’ll find in the DCOM universe. Alongside Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan, established pop stars Adrienne Bailón and Keely Williams (members of 3LW) comprise the group, providing significant credibility… and vocal range. Not to mention, the legendary Whitney Houston is a producer on the film.</p><p>“Cinderella” is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qURdm4_QZI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qURdm4_QZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certified banger</a></span>, and ironically enough, is about how the Cheetah Girls don’t want to be like the famed Disney princess by waiting around for love. They want to go out and find it themselves. This subversion of the typical Disney tale is appropriate given the diversity of the cast and their characters’ backstories: Galleria (Raven-Symoné) is the daughter of a black woman and Italian man; Chanel (Bailón) is Latina and the daughter of a single mother; Dorinda (Bryan) is white and grew up in a New York City foster home; and Aqua (Williams) is a black girl from Texas.</p><p>The authenticity of the dialogue is notable and the singing numbers feel especially spectacular, seeing as they’re shot like 90s/early aughts music videos. <em>The Cheetah Girls</em> is a fun artifact to re-examine and it makes one long for an era when the biggest news story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx0k8lvqhlQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx0k8lvqhlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a dog trapped in an NYC manhole</a></span>. Don’t worry! Toto is saved by singing, of course.</p></div><div><p>Similar to <em>Smart House, </em>in that it’s way ahead of its time technologically, and grapples with the philosophical questions surrounding the use of said tech, <em>Pixel Perfect</em> has a depth seldom reached by a DCOM.</p><p>The movie’s teenage protagonist Roscoe (Raviv Ullman) sets out to find a new lead singer for his best friend Sam’s (Leah Pipes) band that can dance. He takes an unconventional route in casually creating Loretta Modern (Spencer Redford), an artificially intelligent hologram. She’s composed of the looks, voices, and dance moves of the world’s most renowned musicians, as well as Sam’s ears. Weird.</p><p>As Roscoe upgrades and takes care of Loretta, it becomes clear that he loves her (sparking jealousy in Sam), and she has real desires and feelings. She wants to feel the rain on her skin. She grows angry at Sam when the two argue over whether or not she’s real. She desperately asks Roscoe, “Why am I never good enough for you?”</p><p>The line between consciousness and unconsciousness (from a sentient standpoint) is blurred in <em>Pixel Perfect, </em>in a way that mirrors certain AI technology today. That alone makes this DCOM classic worthy of careful consideration. </p><p>Still, the film’s core argument is about love. Roscoe’s dad poignantly asserts that “the more you try to find that kind of perfection in people, the more meals you will eat alone.” While AI can help us tremendously, there’s something innately human (and loveable) about our imperfections. </p></div><div><p>My favorite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/why-corbin-bleu-wikipedia-pages-2019-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-corbin-bleu-wikipedia-pages-2019-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random Disney fact</a></span>: In 2016, Corbin Bleu, who portrays Troy Bolton’s bestie Chad Danforth in <em>High School Musical</em>, had the 3rd most translated Wikipedia page in the world. He only trailed Barack Obama and Jesus Christ. </p><p>Is this why <em>High School Musical</em> is worth a rewatch? No, but it does speak to just how much of a global phenomenon the movie is, spawning sequels, a concert tour, a TV show series on Disney Plus, and super duper star talent (see: Zac Efron and Olivia Rodrigo).</p><p>Most great DCOMs have either a compelling story, magnetic characters, or catchy music. Sometimes, they exhibit two of these qualities. <em>High School Musical </em>captures all three. Troy and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) meet on vacation and tear the cabin down with a karaoke rendition of “Start of Something New.” They then go their separate ways and unexpectedly reunite when Gabriella transfers to Troy’s school.</p><p>In many aspects, the film is an homage to <em>Grease</em>, as it depicts the protagonists connecting away from home (and judgement) and leaving their perceived social boxes to pursue something different. Gabriella’s solo performance of “When There Was Me And You” as she winds the East High halls is Sandy’s (Olivia Newton-John) “Hopelessly Devoted To You” from the 1978 classic film. And the final epic ballad “We’re All In This Together” is analogous to “We Go Together” in both name and spirit.</p><p>“Stick To The Status Quo” captures the mind of a high schooler to a tee: the nightmare scenario of revealing a secret to friends and being rejected for it. What’s great about <em>High School Musical</em> (one of the things, at least) is that there isn’t a clear-cut best song. Upon rewatch, “What I’ve Been Looking For (Reprise)” resonated with me most. The lyrics are simple, but they adequately capture what it means to find your person. You’ve searched for a while, and finally they show up when and where you least expect it (like at a rustic ski lodge in Utah on New Year’s Eve), and the rest is history. Nothing beats that.</p><p>19 years following its release, <em>High School Musical </em>still hits like Coach Bolton’s (Bart Johnson) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaPG7dRHmLo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaPG7dRHmLo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">viral line read</a></span>. Also, shout out to Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay, because you can’t write about <em>HSM</em> without mentioning her.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-ncsoft-reportedly-cancel-unannounced-horizon-mmo.1087590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An MMORPG based on Sony and Guerrilla Games' successful IP&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled. The project was reportedly a collaboration between Sony and&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft.</p>

<p>Bear with me on this one. Back in 2023, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-and-ncsoft-announce-strategic-partnership-to-collaborate-in-various" rel="nofollow">announced a "strategic partnership"</a>, and that partnership was reported to include a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, with leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1741262087647543736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointing to job listings</a> for something called "Project H" (also "Project Skyline") in December that same year.</p>

<p>Now, however, Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-horizons-unannounced-mmo-has-been-quietly-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) has reported that Project H has been canceled following a project review at NCSoft, along with several other titles in development at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=HnasnYjv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=WfRjSZmL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An MMO based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt, because Sony and NCSoft never officially announced the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO in question, so naturally, it also hasn't officially been canceled.</p>

<p>However, cancelling such a project would fit in with what appears to be a wider retreat from the live service market on Sony's part. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled two live service games</a> in development at Bluepoint and Bend, with the former reportedly being a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>The retreat is likely inspired by the colossal failure of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just two weeks after it launched</a> last year. The game's developer would go on to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closed down by Sony</a>, along with Neon Koi, previously known as Savage Game Studios.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that assuming this MMO was actually in development, it's probably not the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">announced back in December 2022</a>, as that's in development at Guerrilla itself rather than a third-party studio (although that could well end up being canceled too).</p>

            <p>The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a> proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fishing-games-dont-come-much-cuter-than-the-animal-crossing-style-island-of-webfishing">an easygoing escape</a>. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sledding-game">Sledding Game</a> looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine. </p>

<p>You'll earn points while sledding down the mountain (at one point we see the sledder grind a rail) and then use these points to buy cosmetics like "hats, jackets, scarves, goggles" as well as stickers for your sled. You'll be able to make snowmen, get into snowball fights, and ride a ski lift back up the mountain when you inevitably wipe out on an unexpected slope. "Whether you're racing to the bottom or taking it slow, the hill is all about fun, friends, and freedom," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3438850/Sledding_Game/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game's creator, a solo developer professionally branded as "The Sledding Company", has been posting devlog videos on TikTok since December. They demonstrate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7459466030050479402">how players will get off the ski lift</a> and pay sorrowful tribute to an <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7458729542614584619">endless field of frog corpses</a>. "My main inspiration is mainly from Webfishing, which I guess is inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>," said the dev in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sledding_game/video/7450006703212350766">the video announcing the game</a>, before asking for suggestions from viewers. "I don't really know where to go with this project, I just think it's a fun little game-slash-playground-thing." </p><p>The creator also has plans to add 100-player lobbies with proximity voice chat and text chat, which seems a tad ambitious for a small-scale messabout like this. Not to mention a surefire way to emperil the "cozy" and low-key vibe the game seems to be aiming at. Webfishing has 12-player lobbies, for example, and already has to contend with the spectrum of online (mis)behaviour that comes with chat rooms. Even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, a more chaotic party game about going downhill in the snow, taps out at 40 players (and it limits player chitchat to emotes). Although the Sledding Company does add that the 100-player plan is not set in stone, saying: "until further testing, this will just be a guess".</p>
<p>However it turns out, I like when devs show their work like this. I know it can simply be a good marketing strategy for smaller studios and lone developers (people like to watch funny videos on apps that annoy the United States government, it turns out) but ragdolls are always appreciated. And watching developers run headfirst into bugs is doubtless reassuring for fellow struggling game designers otherwise doomscrolling into the abyss. </p>
<p>Sledding Game doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll keep an eye on these penguins for you. It looks like they require supervision anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience</a>. These tools included the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.</p><p>This move followed frequent criticism that the platform was not doing enough to ensure the safety of its audience, which is predominantly children. In July of last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will not be a massive problem for ports and multiplatform games, as additional optimization work will get these games running decently on the system.</p>
<p>Famiiboards user MattAgain, who is a known developer who has worked in the video game industry for a long time and provided some valuable insights in the past, recently <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the newly revealed system, highlighting how the Switch 2 CPU, while being the part that deviates the most from the standard set by the system overall, is not going to be cause of concern for developers, as no one making a Switch 2 game from the ground up is complaining about it. The only small complaints have come from developers working on ports, which will apparently require a bit more CPU optimization work, compared to how relatively easily graphical resources can scale to the GPU. This additional CPU optimization work, however, isn't anything that shouldn't be expected, going from a power-hungry x86 to a mobile ARM CPU. So, for the time being, the system's CPU shouldn't be an impediment, and, as a whole, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting</a> a PlayStation 5 game to the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be much easier than porting a PlayStation 4 game to the original Switch, which is great news.</p>
<p>The fact that porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easier than porting games to its predecessor is definitely great news, as this should allow third-party developers to support the system with ease. Very few games have been confirmed for the new Nintendo consoles, but according to rumors, plenty of big publishers are looking into supporting the console heavily, such as Microsoft, who is reportedly working on ports of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">Diablo IV, Fallout 4 and even Starfield</a>. According to a recent report, basically, every third-party developer is considering supporting the system with their most ambitious AAA titles.</p>

            <p>Steam are throwing a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy_real_time">Real-Time Strategy Fest</a> this week, encompassing discounts and demos, and people who like clicking on Orc-emitting huts are eating well. Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">Creeper World 4</a> were a bit more like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ground-control-game">Ground Control</a>.

<p>The premise: you are the sole surviving crew member aboard an Avaris Corporation deep-space mining vessel. After a century in cryosleep, you're woken by the shipboard AI and unceremoniously bundled off to the surface of a lifeless planet in search of ore. Then you discover that the planet ain't so lifeless.</p>
<p>The basic flow here is a mixture of tower-defencey base-building and surgical incursions upon a decentralised, enveloping threat that steadily and insidiously paints the map its colour. You'll need to set up turrets and a robust power grid to keep them online. But you'll also need to build tanks, artillery and so forth so that you can clear distant canyons of invasive plants before they become a problem. There are different kinds of plants, which correspond in some ways to the unit types of a traditional RTS, but the thrill of Calyx, I think, is pitting a regular strategy game toolset against a foe that doesn't play by the same rules.</p><p>The demo includes a tutorial level and "an alpha quality, mid-game level to show how the final experience might feel". Creators Studio 568 <a href="https://www.studio568.co.uk/about">were founded</a> by three, pretty seasoned developers with credits at Epic Games, Lionhead and Natural Motion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ncsofts-horizon-mmo-has-also-reportedly-been-canceled/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NCSoft’s Horizon MMO, codenamed Project H, has reportedly been canceled.</p>



<p>That’s according to the South Korean website <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>), who say that at least three projects at NCSoft had been canceled, including Project Pantera, Project H, and Project J. According to widespread rumors, Project H was the codename of the Horizon MMO, which would be later called Skyline.</p>



<p>According to the report, both Project J and Project H were canceled at the beginning of the year, with its developers being notified that they’d been moving to different teams across the company.</p>



<p>In late 2023, NCSoft announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-and-ncsoft-global-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global business partnership with Sony</a>, spearheaded by SIE’s Jim Ryan and NCSOFT’s Taekjin Kim. </p>



<p>The Horizon MMO shouldn’t be confused with Horizon Online, another Horizon project in development at Guerrilla Games, which is forecasting up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players on the title</a>. The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;in 2022 as a “online project set in the Horizon universe.” A recent job listing suggests that the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Project H’s cancellation marks the third project this month reportedly canceled. Last week, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two live-service games were canceled</a>, one at Bend Studio and the other at Bluepoint. According to the report, Bluepoint’s game was a live-service God of War game.</p>



<p>As of 9 May 2023, the&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;series has sold over 32 million copies worldwide, over 8.4 million of which are for Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-mmo-by-ncsoft-may-have-been-canceled-according-to-a-new-report.1087545/</guid>

			<p>The Horizon MMO that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">reportedly</a> in the works by Korean development studio NCSoft may have been canceled alongside other projects, according to a new report that's been making the rounds.</p>
<p>Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTN</a> shared an exclusive report last week, as posted on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA</a>, which confirms how some of the studio's projects, which include Project H, the Horizon MMO, have stopped development following a feasibility review. Developers assigned to these projects, according to MTN, were notified about the end of development and to prepare for internal transfers late last year and at the beginning of 2025. Some of these canceled projects have also disappeared from the company's organizational charts, so it definitely looks like development has been terminated for good.</p>
<p>As the Horizon MMO was never formally announced, it is unlikely that an announcement will be made regarding the end of development. Still, this is definitely not a good look for Sony right now, whose push into live service games seems to have only brought disastrous results, with the failed launch of Concord last year and the recent cancelation of two other games in development by Bluepoint Games, who was developing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War live service game</a>, and Bend Studio. The Horizon multiplayer game, whose first look came with some leaked footage back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">2023</a>, on the other hand, is still in development, so Sony is still going ahead with expanding the franchise beyond the single-player boundaries set by the first two main entries in the series.</p>

            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

<p>Since then we've heard little more, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmorpg-is-now-essentially-confirmed-to-be-in-development-job-listing-suggests">job listings shared in 2023 which appeared to confirm the Horizon MMO was in development</a> with the codename Project Skyline (with the initial codename being Project H). And now, it appears the MMO has been cancelled before it was even officially announced.</p><p>A report by Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/">ResetEra</a>) states work on Project H and a number of other projects has ceased following a "feasibility review" at NCSoft. "Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

<p>Today's news follows a report earlier in the month that Sony had cancelled two more of its proposed live service games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">one from Days Gone developer Bend and one from Bluepoint</a>. Bluepoint was reportedly developing a live service game within the God of War series.</p>
<p>In the time since, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-studio-says-it-still-plans-on-creating-cool-sht-after-sony-pulls-plug-on-latest-game">Bend Studio has said it "still plans on creating cool shit"</a> following the cancellation of its game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has been adapted into an official manga comic.</p>
<p>The first chapter is available to read digitally now in English on <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1023739">Manga Plus by Shueisha</a>, while in Japan the manga will feature in V Jump magazine.</p>
<p>The comic comes from artist Yoichi Amano, who previously worked on the Dragon Quest Treasures adaptation, based on Atlus' RPG.</p>

<p>So far, this first chapter closely follows the story of the game and uses the canonical name for the young protagonist: Will.</p>
<p>It begins with the ambush from the opening of the game and sees Will exploring the Royal Capital Grand Trad, subject to prejudice, and remembering the past through flashbacks. It's all very familiar if you've played the game.</p>
<p>At least, at first. The manga changes the way Will meets fan-favourite character Strohl leading towards the climax of this chapter, suggesting it won't be a simple recreation of the game. Perhaps other character interactions will be switched up too?</p>
<p>Either way, expect plenty of chapters to run through Metaphor: ReFantazio's lengthy narrative that merges RPG conventions with political commentary in a rich fantastical world.</p> <div>

<p>"Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio game review</a>. "What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart."</p>
<p>The game proved popular for Atlus, selling a million copies in its first day to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">the developer's fastest-selling game</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation follows similar work by Kadokawa to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-manga-turns-the-game-into-a-farce">adapt Elden Ring into a manga comic</a>, though its Tarnished protagonist is a hopeless hero. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-delayed-but-new-teaser-trailer-shows-work-in-progress">fan-made Elden Ring anime adaptation</a> is also due later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
