<p>Very few headlines have sent a shiver down our spines quite like this one, but yes, you read that correctly. Over 20 years after the release of <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong>, Quentin Tarantino has returned to write and direct one final chapter in the film's chronology... and it's premiering in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>"Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as 'Yuki’s Revenge'," the caption to the newly-released teaser trailer above reads. "Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite".</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch the short film, fully animated in the Fortnite engine and starring Uma Thurman (yes, <em>the</em> Uma Thurman), in Fortnite on <strong>30th November</strong> at <strong>7pm GMT / 8pm CET / 2pm, ET / 11am PT</strong>. Alternatively, you can catch it in cinemas during the upcoming screenings of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> from 5th December.</p>
<p>Those who purchase a ticket to the film's opening weekend will receive a code for Yuki's Gogo Yubari outfit, which can also be unlocked in-game from 27th Nov - 1st Dec.</p>

<p>Fortnite has played host to all kinds of big music events over the years, but the premiere of a new Quentin Tarantino joint (albeit an animated short)? That's <em>wild</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have watched <strong>Kill Bill</strong> will know that it's no family-friendly affair, and while the teaser for the Fortnite short looks like things will be toned down a little (there's only so much peril and gore you can show with an anthropomorphised banana in the background), there's something about the combination of <em>this</em> film and <em>this</em> game that just feels... <em>eeeehh</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, for the Tarantino completionists who want to get in on his latest project early, we'll see you on the Battle Bus. Gosh, what a world we live in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paradox Announces $37 Million Write-Down After Bloodlines 2 Fails to Meet Sales Estimates, But the DLCs Are Still Happening]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/paradox-announces-37-million-writedown-bloodlines-2-fails-meet-sales-estimates/</link>
            <guid>1366345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a press release shared late yesterday evening, Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 failed to meet its sales estimates. Due to the game's underperformance, the publisher has been forced to make a non-cash write-down of around $37 million in 'capitalized development costs'.</p>



<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said that the company is proud of the work done by The Chinese Room (which replaced the original developer, Hardsuit Labs), but also admitted that the sales will not match the projections. In a refreshing move, the executive took the blame on the publisher's side instead of blaming the developers as so often happens nowadays, adding that Paradox's lack of expertise in the action RPG genre made it challenging to gauge the game's sales properly.</p>



<p>In the future, Wester vowed to return to the publisher's core market, which has always been in the grand strategy genre. Paradox's most accomplished games are, after all, Imperator: Rome, the Crusader Kings series, the Europa Universalis series (which has just received <a href="https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its fifth main installment</a>), the Victoria series, the Hearts of Iron series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellaris-out-of-this-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellaris</a>. This isn't surprising, as Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja already <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> last year that another Bloodlines title would be licensed out instead of developed internally.</p>



<p>Indeed, Fredrik Wester said:</p>



<p><em>We’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.</em></p>



<p>That said, Paradox confirmed that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is still getting its two DLCs as planned, as well as other free post-launch updates. In the DLCs, players will find themselves in the shoes of different characters: Loose Cannon is focused on the former Sheriff of the Seattle Court, Benny Muldoon, whereas The Flower &amp; the Flame lets you play as the Toreador vampire Ysabella. The first DLC will be available in Q2 2026, with the second DLC following in Q3.</p>



<p>Recently, former The Chinese Room Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-bloodlines-2-creative-director-wanted-to-call-the-game-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that he attempted to persuade Paradox to change the game's name because the studio lacked the time and resources to create a proper Bloodlines game. Alas, the publisher did not relent, and the result is abysmal sales and mixed reviews.</p>



<p>I somewhat enjoyed my time with Bloodlines 2, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in the review</a> that its several flaws only warranted purchase at a much lower price, and even then, only for fans of Vampire: The Masquerade. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev team is set to grow substantially over the next couple of years, as CD Projekt ramp up development. While most of their ranks right now are on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, a game that's at least made some public cameos even if it's still sans release date, once 2027 rolls around, Cyberpunk 2 looks like it won't be too far behind.</p>
<p>This info comes from the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf">financial report</a>, covering the time running from July 1st to September 30th this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their presentation, CD Projekt interrupted some shouting about the original Cyberpunk continuing to sell well by showing off a developer headcount graph forecasting how they plan to continue "laying the foundations for Cyberpunk 2" across 2026 and 2027. These efforts follow lessons CD Projekt have said they learned from the first Cyberpunk's infamous launch, with <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/cyberpunk-2077-was-a-valuable-lesson-adam-kicinski-on-work-organi/zb3a43">understaffing around the pandemic</a> contributing to in the run up to crunch and more game-centric foibles like the RPG's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cdpr-says-its-new-boston-studio-means-cyberpunk-2-will-be-more-authentically-american/">European-style manhole covers</a> being a symptom of some struggles for a Europe-based dev team to really nail the nuances of an American dystopian city.</p>
<p>As of October 31st this year, the studio says 135 devs are working on Cyberpunk 2. The graph shows Cyberpunk 2's development is split across teams in Warsaw and Vancouver, as well as a bigger group at the newer Boston studio CD Projekt set up specially to work on the sequel. As of these financials, the 135 cited look to mainly be in Boston, with CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">noting</a> that team's around 80 people strong and mostly senior level staff.</p><p>"Having accomplished our goal of building a strong leadership team at its core, we are now shifting to hiring more mid-entry level roles to carry on with pre-production works," he explained. "We plan to expand the Boston-based Cyberpunk team as the project progresses, and double it in the next two years." So, that'd bring the team to about 160-ish people by 2027. Meanwhile, the Canada and Poland-based teams are set to grow, too, so the entire ensemble will swell to just over 300 staff in the same timespan.</p>
<p>The graph doesn't give exact numbers for these planned future headcounts and Nowakowski alluded to wanting to "shift the split" between the two sets of devs to "around 50%" in the same time, making it a bit harder to compare these numbers to the 447 devs currently working on The Witcher 4. As of writing, it looks like the 2027 headcount will fall short of that Witchery number by about 100 devs. One thing Nowakowski added is that the company still strongly believe all the investment they have made and plan to make in adding the Boston studio will "pay off in the future, bringing the next Cyberpunk experience to a new level."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that means the teams working on it will eventually come to surpass the number of people CD Projekt chucked at the original, which a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/fy-2020-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about the company's 2020 financial results I've gone back and dug up cites as having been the work of 530 developers. Cyberpunk 2077 was famously plagued with bugs at launch, so hopefully all this investment will see its sequel avoid the same fate. That might not mean lobbing more devs at it, though, especially given a lot of CD Projekt's spending has been with the goal of just being able to work on Cyberpunk and The Witcher simultaneously, rather than switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Either way, with a more deliberate build-up over these next two years, one would hope the result in a smoother road once the game really starts to gather speed. For now, Nowakowski's "happy with the progress the CP2 team has made so far", but warned "it’s for sure too early to talk about entering any next stage or phase of this project".</p><p>Numbers, eh? For now, The Witcher 4's the thing to keep an eye on release-wise as it's far further along in the pipeline, though Nowakowski has <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">tweeted</a> that it won't be popping up at this year's Game Awards following its reveal at least year's iteration.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/upgrade-your-pc-or-playstation5-storage-by-as-much-as-8tb-samsung-9100-pro-up-to-33-off-2000647606</link>
            <guid>1366333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="318">As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, it’s becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/">Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.&nbsp;</a>This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="318">Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether you’re editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1136" data-end="1568">Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your system’s power usage.</p>
<h2 data-start="1136" data-end="1568">PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2047">If you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, you’ve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, you’ll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, it’s crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.</p>


<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.</p>
<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.</p>

<p>There are probably a few collectors around the world who are keen to buy and own every piece of Fortnite media in existence. One of the most lucrative and desirable pieces of memorabilia is the game itself, and a physical copy of Fortnite has become the most expensive ever.</p>



<p>It’s hard to imagine there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collectible that hasn’t been manufactured. Epic Games continues to sit on one of the richest and phattest cash cows in gaming. While more unorthodox merchandise is out there, including Fortnite Crocs—because even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-special-edition-crocs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox is doing Crocs</a> now—the physical game itself in perfect condition is where it’s at.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-fortnite-physical-copy-has-sold">The Most Expensive Fortnite Physical Copy Has Sold</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The smell of money. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/xbox/fortnite-wata-10-a-sealed-storm-master-weapon-pack-xbox-one-gearbox-2017-usa/a/7428-28105.s?ic4=ListView-ShortDescription-071515#auction-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heritage Auctions</a> oversaw the sale of a sealed “Fortnite – Wata 10 A++.” This means the box is in perfect condition, sealed, and has achieved the highest grade possible in terms of its quality, condition, and other factors.</p>







<p>It’s also a 2017 original physical copy, too. With all this in mind, it’s sort of no surprise to see the prized possession sell for <strong>$42,500!</strong></p>



<p>Some would argue this might be too much for a sealed video game that no one has the intention of opening. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Wow. Credit to Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of Fortnite is that it’s a free-to-play digital title, so the user can still easily play Fortnite anyway, but have a desirable collectible on display to marvel at in between hard-earned dubs.</p>



<p>How much would you be prepared to pay for a collectible? Is this a great purchase given that it’s likely to appreciate more as the years go by? As usual, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to tell all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New job listings have revealed that Sledgehammer Games is currently hiring developers who have past experience with the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that their next Call of Duty title could be coming to the platform.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a Senior Technical Artist was found on LinkedIn and states that someone with “AAA mobile or Switch experience” would receive “bonus XP” with their application.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-finally-heading-to-switch">Call of Duty Finally Heading to Switch</h2>



<p>For those out of the loop of Call of Duty, the series hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms since 2023, with the last in the series on Nintendo being Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p>



<p>However, as a part of the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was finalized in October 2023, it was ruled that Microsoft must release Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms for 10 years. At the time of writing, that agreement has not yet started as Call of Duty has remained to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Presumably, Call of Duty hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms due to hardware limitations, a concern raised by regulatory bodies during the proposed acquisition. However, since the Nintendo Switch 2’s release earlier this year, it has proven that it can release games of similar hardware demands, suggesting that the Switch 2 could easily run Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sledgehammer Games’ next title, believed to be released in 2027, will be the first in the series to release on the Nintendo Switch 2 remains to be seen, as Infinity Ward is set to release Modern Warfare 4 in 2026, set in Korea.</p>

Developer Sparrow Night's newspaper management game gives the player one week to report out, print, and distribute the weekly paper—and do everything in between, be it decorating the office with plants, managing power struggles across the city, or optimizing workstations. It all matters in determining what role your newspaper will play in a fictional '30s version of New York City.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Sparrow Night was formed in 2019 by Jan-Maarten Nachtegeller and Stefan Rijsmus, Nachtegeller found the inspiration for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in 2016 after reading a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/feature/making-the-new-york-times">Mashable photo feature</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on the New York Times in the '40s, in which dozens of black-and-white photos showcased the news-making process from the time. Reporters smoke cigarettes at messy desks in a crowded newsroom. People at typewriters record messages received over wires from around the world. Paper falls from printers and onto the floor, which is no longer visible under the white sheets. Typersetters build out molds to create newspaper plates for printing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a complicated process—and perfect to translate into a video game. It wasn't until 2017, though, when Nachtegeller started to conceptualize what a game could look like, after playing Weappy Studio's&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This Is The Police</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I instantly thought about the newspaper project," he said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/creating-the-card-based-rpg-battle-suit-aces-game-developer-podcast-ep-59" target="_self" data-discover="true">Creating the card-based RPG Battle Suit Aces - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 59</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rijsmus and Nachtegeller began working on&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in late 2018 into 2019. Bart van de Sande joined the team in 2020, contributing as both a developer and the composer behind &nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s music. More team members joined later in the process, including support from publisher Twin Sails Interactive. Over the past six years, Sparrow Night has been iterating on the core idea of the game—based on the newspaper processes of companies like the New York Times—to create a compelling management game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What appeals to me about&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is that it's a little bit of everything," van de Sande said. "If you're really a history freak, you will like the game. But if you like managing a conveyor belt, so to speak, that's what it boils down to."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player takes over a struggling newspaper and rebuilds it nearly from scratch. They must renovate both the office and the ethical standards of the newspaper—balancing the need to publish accurate, newsworthy stories about world events with salacious pieces that bring in tons of eyeballs. Then there's advertising—which takes up precious space in the paper—and different groups lobbying for good coverage. You need to keep your employees, readers, and the looming mafia happy to succeed. It's quite the highwire act, which makes it a compelling management simulator.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/finding-smart-shortcuts-in-a-short-hike-postmortem-unlocking-the-vault-4" target="_self" data-discover="true">Finding smart shortcuts in A Short Hike postmortem - Unlocking the Vault #4</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're just a couple of guys goofing around.

Nachtgeller pointed to the role of editors in the process as something that needed to be cut. "The editor normally has a way bigger role, and that's something we always struggled with," he said. It made the game too much in the weeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of development,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;went through several iterations. "We've done many iterations on different concepts in the game," van de Sande said. "We're making a game about running a newspaper. But how do you actually translate that to a game? It's a very difficult subject to make concrete rules."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was originally released as an early access title in February 2024, which let Sparrow Night keep iterating while receiving feedback from the playerbase. Van de Sande said that process was as much a financial decision as a creative one.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/marvel-rivals-introduced-a-pve-mode-to-reduce-the-pressure-of-competition" target="_self" data-discover="true">Marvel Zombies was built to give Marvel Rivals players a breather</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team had already been toiling away on its own for years, tweaking systems and cutting and removing content. Nachtgeller said the news items system is one of those pieces of the game that went through a lot of changes before they eventually landed on "an elegant solution.", But it meant removing some of the complexities they originally fleshed out. Van de Sande said there were six or seven versions of that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Something we had at the beginning was that the newspaper was almost a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;game in itself, like you had to fit stuff in," Nachtgeller said. "You had to fit stuff, and there was too much emphasis on being an arcade element. That got taken out. We also had a fully functional power system with cords that you had to bring all the way to the tower, but that took away too much from the newspaper making."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But early access was a chance to recoup some costs and get direct feedback from more players. It was a way to ease into the release of a new game, which Nachtgeller explained can be quite daunting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't know how people do it without the community test," he said. "Without having the feedback, it's even scarier to release a game. It already feels very scary, but you at least know that quite a lot of people had fun in the early access, so you can bank on that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, Sparrow Night will spend some time monitoring&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release and fixing any bugs and issues that arise. When they're ready to move onto a new project, there are some learnings the team will take with them. The first thing that they'll do, Nachtgeller said, is hone into the core gameplay early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost no project that's exactly like how it started, but having more strict boundaries does help," Nachtgeller said, while noting thatSparrow Night wants to keep its development structure loose enough to allow for experimentation. "It's been quite loose, and that's one of our strengths," van de Sande said. "We're just a couple of guys goofing around. We will get a bit more structured for the next projects, more streamlined, but we shouldn't lose our looseness, because it's also what makes it fun, and what makes&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;stand out, because we're not your ordinary game development studio."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/news-tower-is-designed-to-nourish-your-inner-history-freak-]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a patch this morning, fixing an exploit that allowed players to shoot quicker than intended with the help of quick-use items, which was allowing some to dominate fights with other players.</p>
<p>This was best used with the El Toro shotgun, a close-ranged powerhouse balanced with its low rate of fire. With this exploit, players were unloading multiple shells in quick succession, causing havoc on live servers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdOeQ96Ecg">Here's an excellent video by Gravez that shows it in action</a>. This was dubbed "double pumping" by some members of the community, as you could often knock out a light-shield user with two well placed shots with the El Toro. Stop laughing.</p>
<p>The way it worked was simple: you would shoot, which initiates the re-chambering animation, and then quickly press the quick use button during this animation, followed by the button for the weapon slot of your weapon mid-animation. This would cancel the animation early with a new round ready to go, slicing down the reload time significantly.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are other fixes included in the patch that deserve their flowers. All locked rooms across the game have exploit mitigation mechanics added, following weeks of players finding inventive ways to break in without keycards. Players can also no longer push other people around by jumping on each other's backs, so no more funny business.</p>
<p>There are also some more minor fixes, such as main menu texture problems going the way of the dodo, lighting artifacts upon entering a map being removed, and the correct voice options actually being reflected on restarting the game.</p>
<p>It's not the most bombastic patch, but it is one with a massive impact on the experience for high-end players. PvP is now fairer, and you'll actually need keycards to get the best loot. Stellar Montis should now be a safer place for raiders, minus all the Arc still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-nerfs-one-of-its-most-devastating-weapons-floods-your-room-with-ducks">hunting for your rubber ducks</a> of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players">A nice location for the still-absurd number of players to dive into</a>, relatively worry free.</p>

            <guid>1366288</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent Polish developer Rebel Wolves is hard at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut open world action roleplaying game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be published by Bandai Namco</a>.</p>



<p>The studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">founded</a> in 2022 by former CD Projekt RED developers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with some investment from NetEase</a>), and indeed, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks a lot like The Witcher III: Wild Hunt on the surface</a>. However, the game has been designed to offer much greater freedom to players, as outlined by Game Director Konrad Tomaskiewicz <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Eurogamer</a> at the recent Golden Joystick Awards 2025:</p>



<p><em>No, there's no main quest. You build your experience from the quests you encounter. You know where your enemy is. You can attack this place anytime you want to. It's up to you if you want to do it by yourself, or if you want to build yourself, find the powerful items, develop your character, or do some quests and find allies to help you do it. We want to bring video games closer to pen-and-paper RPGs and give you the freedom to experience what you want to experience.</em></p>



<p>When asked by the interviewer if the concept in The Blood of Dawnwalker was kind of similar to Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance games, Tomaskiewicz said the approach was rather more similar to the first two Fallout installments:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance is not a bad example, but still they have the main story that develops; you have the open world and the main quest which is leading you. In our game it's different. Our game is more similar in this area to the old Fallout, the first and second games, where you have a clear goal and everything is optional - you decide. You travel the world, you decide what you want to do. There is no main quest.</em></p>



<p>On a related note, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/dawnwalker-will-have-serious-consequences-for-both-action-and-inaction-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously noted</a> that The Blood of Dawnwalker would feature heavy consequences for both action and inaction, highlighting its strong roleplaying elements.</p>

            <p>Valve have blocked card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flick-solitaire">Flick Solitaire</a> from the Russian version of Steam, after federal censorship body Roskomnadzor contacted the platform holder to order its removal for "promoting non-traditional sexualities". </p>
<p>In a letter, Valve have also reproached developers Flick Games for failing "to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be". Flick Solitaire is still available in Russia via the iOS and Android storefronts, however, despite Roskomnadzor sending similar notes to Apple and Google. As of writing, Valve appear to be the only platform who have caved to Russian state requests to censor the game.</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from the latest edition of <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, written by George E. Osborn. To start from the beginning, Flick Solitaire released on iOS and Android in June 2020. It's a free-to-play collection of Solitaire variations distinguished by the titular flick controls and some lavish decks from independent artists, which include cards with queer themes such as Amee Wilsons' Queer Chameleon Deck (pictured above) and Ollie T's Drag Deck. I can't say I'm compelled by the familiar option to grind for unlockable decks, or spend real money on in-game coins or a subscription pass, but I do think some of the designs are beautiful. </p>

<p>The game has been available in Russia since its mobile launch - it's the game's second largest market, in fact - though Flick Games demonetised it for Russian players following the Vladimir Putin government's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, to avoid generating any revenue for the aggressor.</p><p>Then, on 1st October 2025, Flick Solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">launched in Steam early access</a>. The developers say they had also demonetised the Steam version for Russian players, while noting that they can't do anything about platform features like store credit that might allow people to get around the block. For context, Steam currently doesn't allow direct purchases by Russian players, in accordance with western sanctions, so Russian buyers have to make use of workarounds such as third-party key resellers.</p>
<p>On 28th October, Flick Games say they received official notices from Roskomnadzor, advising them that they had broken a 2006 law against the promotion of "non-traditional sexualities" - the VGIM article doesn't specify, but I imagine it's referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_anti-LGBTQ_law">this infamous amendment</a> prohibiting the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors. The censor also cc'd Flick Games on emails to Apple, Google and the developers' web host, ordering the removal of Flick Solitaire from their platforms.</p>
<p>According to VGIM's report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's request. Apple acknowledged the censor's letter but assured Flick Games that it "did not affect the studio's standing with the platform", as Osborn puts it. Valve, however, added a country restriction for Flick Solitaire, without giving Flick Games the opportunity to contest or appeal the decision. Here's the text of their accompanying message to the developers, as passed on by VGIM.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Partner,</p>
<p>Your game, FLICK SOLITAIRE (3690460), was determined by Roskomnadzor to be in violation of Russian requirements for distribution. We've added a country restriction to the game so that it no longer appears in Russia.</p>
<p>We also want to remind you that you promised Valve under the Steam Distribution Agreement that your game complies with all applicable laws. Therefore, it is your responsibility to do your due diligence regarding where your game is allowed to be distributed, and to inform us of any territory where it cannot be.</p></blockquote>
<p>VGIM say they've contacted Valve for a comment on Flick Games's account, but have yet to receive a response. I'll follow up with a request from RPS.</p>
<p>Valve have a track record for restricting access to games on Steam to appease draconian governments. In China, the platform holder operate a separate version of Steam with games licensed by regulators, though a huge number of Chinese players use the international version of Steam to get hold of unapproved releases. Individual cases of Valve bending for Chinese censors include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">the removal</a> of brilliant Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> from sale, after it was found to contain a derogatory reference to the country's president Xi Jinping. As for Steam's operations in Russia, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">boasted in October 2024</a> that they had pushed Valve to remove "over 260 materials containing illegal content", without going into specifics. </p><p>Valve have also been in the headlines lately for delisting or removing a swathe of games with sexual themes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">at the behest of international payment processing networks</a>. Here, as in the case of Flick Solitaire, the platform holder has generally avoided taking a stance on the games in question, preferring to frame it all in the technicalities of compliance with governments or financial institutions, while gesturing towards catch-all prohibitions on "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". Valve are also currently at loggerheads with Italian developers Santa Ragione over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">their refusal to publish the horror game Horses</a>, apparently in response to a scene of a young woman riding a naked slave, though this pre-dates the payment processor crackdown.</p>
<p>Queer people in Russia face enormous oppression. In December 2022, Putin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-signs-law-expanding-russias-rules-against-lgbt-propaganda-2022-12-05/">effectively outlawed</a> public expression of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by signing a bill against "LGBT propaganda". In June 2023, Russia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-sexologists-target-homosexuality-other-disorders-under-new-rules-2023-06-29/">took steps</a> toward reinstating the idea of homosexuality being a mental illness. It's currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66200194">illegal</a> in Russia for trans people to change their legal gender or receive gender-affirming care. Same-sex marriages or civil unions are also forbidden.</p>
<p>Valve have professed support for queer developers and players on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/steam-now-has-an-official-lgbtq-tag-hub-page">adding a LGBTQ+ store tag in 2019</a> and hosting <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/lgbtq-sale/">LGBTQ+ sales</a> among other events, but these seem like trivial shows of positive optics next to the company's on-going willingness to meet the demands of repressive regimes. I'll update this piece if Valve respond.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-findings-show-sbmm-might-not-be-as-open-as-advertised/</link>
            <guid>1366279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest advertised features for Black Ops 7 multiplayer was open lobbies. For the first time in years, Treyarch was removing the SBMM shackles from Call of Duty players, offering a more open and varied matchmaking experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a> is not supposed to be the main factor considered for Black Ops 7 matchmaking. The game’s open lobbies are supposed to represent this new ideology, but CoD content creator TheXclusiveAce has conducted a small test to check if everything is as transparent as it seems.</p>







<h2 id="h-sbmm-could-be-affecting-black-ops-7-lobbies-more-than-you-think">SBMM Could Be Affecting Black Ops 7 Lobbies More Than You Think</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What’s the truth? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the creator’s ‘XclusiveReloaded’ YouTube channel, they asked an important question in a new video: “Is Skill Really ‘Minimally Considered’ in Black Ops 7?”</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is supposed to favour certain conditions, such as region, proximity, and numerous other factors, before taking into account a player’s skill level—the final parameter being the heartbeat of SBMM. </p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce opened by discussing the ongoing narrative in the community that SBMM is stronger and more prevalent than advertised. Many think it’s been ramped up as of late. This is where the renowned data tracker compared some numbers.</p>







<p>“I do feel my experience has been changing as time has been going on. I have been feeling like my matchmaking times are going up, my connection quality is no longer nearly as consistent as it was early on, and as it was in the open matchmaking in the beta build of the game. On top of that, I’ve been noticing that more often than not, my lobbies are a lot more difficult than they were in the first few days.”</p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce used two accounts to test their theory: Their regular account the play the majority of Black Ops 7 on, and their bot account that’s sole purpose is for offline testing, as they constantly check weapons and attachments to find meta loadouts with it. They played at the same time of day, and kept the variables and controllable factors consistent.</p>



<p>In 10 matches, the creator used traditional Team Deathmatch matchmaking to see the results for each account. The final stats are quite interesting.</p>



<p>The main account’s 10 matches took 34 seconds on average to find a game, compared to 28 seconds on the bot account. 6 seconds isn’t the end of the world, but leans ever-so-slightly in favor of SBMM. However, the average ping was a different story.</p>



<p>The average ping for the main account was 42ms, whereas it was 25ms for the bot account. TheXclusiveAce says the best ping they can get is 20ms, and the bot account was within 5ms of this in eight matches out of 10. The main account achieved this feat <em>once</em>, with several games reaching into the high 40s and low 50s.</p>



<p>SBMM generally takes longer on average, as the system has to find players in your skill bracket, which means it might have to go further around the world to find players, which adds more time to matchmaking, and can influence ping. This data and study aren’t conclusive—due to it being such a small data sample—but the initial numbers are eyebrow-raising and only support the narrative that Black Ops 7’s SBMM might be stronger than first thought.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0bb4ac7f3e954"><a title="Nintendo Studios" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb4ac7f3e954/nintendo-studios.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in Bandai Namco Studios Singapore after reaching an agreement with Bandai Namco for the transfer of shares next year.</p>
<p>Described in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html">the press release</a> as being "for the purpose of strengthening its development structure," BNSS will become a Nintendo subsidiary and go by the new name of Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
<p>The deal is planned to go through on 1st April 2026, with Nintendo acquiring 80% of shares, with the rest to follow some time after "once the subsidiary’s operations have stabilized."</p>
<p>Nintendo has partnered with Bandai Namco on several first-party projects, with this studio having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> (contributing concept art, character modelling, environment modelling, and animation, according to <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/news/games/splatoon-3/">the studio's website</a>) as well as various high-profile Bandai Namco games. Here's a description of the studio from <a href="https://bandainamcostudios.sg/">Bandai Namco's site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, our studio in Singapore has worked on a variety of iconic game titles such as TEKKEN, ACE COMBAT, SOUL CALIBUR and Taiko no Tatsujin. From concept to art, and all the way to development, we cover it all. Explore our portfolio of game and demo titles by selecting any of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo anticipates that the acquisition "will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year."</p>
<p>This latest acquisition follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-states-its-intention-to-acquire-more-development-teams">acknowledgement earlier in November</a> that the company intended to expand its internal development teams. Nintendo Pictures was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/nintendo-publishes-job-listings-for-newly-acquired-nintendo-pictures">another addition in 2022</a>, followed by Shiver Entertainment's integration <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/shiver-entertainment-has-updated-its-website-after-being-acquired-by-nintendo">in 2024</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest ARC Raiders Patch Destroys One of the Most Annoying Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-destroys-annoying-exploits/</link>
            <guid>1366273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has just pushed out a small but mighty update for ARC Raiders – 1.4.0. This patch addresses some of the game’s most critical bugs and exploits, including one that has been plaguing players for the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It’s a graphical and quality-of-life thing more than anything else, and while no <strong>new content </strong>has been added with the 1.4.0 update, the improvements included in the change are being welcomed with open arms by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-locked-door-exploits-in-arc-raiders">No More Locked Door Exploits in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The full list of content and bug fixes included in the ARC Raiders 1.4.0 update is being appreciated by fans of the ambitious extraction adventure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li>



<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick-use item and back.</li>



<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low-resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li>



<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li>



<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li>



<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>The locked door exploits were a huge bugbear for players legitimately using keys (which are often single-use) to enter high-tier areas, only to find that somebody had already scooped loot from the room without needing to bring in the key at all, some of which are drastically rare.</p>



<p>With this update, players attempting to access locked rooms without keys will now be incinerated. That’s right, <em>burned to death</em>.</p>



<p>The other bug (read: exploit) that was disturbing users everywhere was the ‘double pump’ gun exploit that allowed users to swap to a quick-use item and back again, flicking between two shotguns to produce an alarming rate of fire and damage output.</p>



<p>It was seen being used even by the game’s most prominent streamers, and it made close-quarters PvP almost unwinnable.</p>



<p>That has also been addressed by this small patch, which is available to download and install <strong>right now</strong> on all platforms.</p>







<p>Are you grateful to see the back of these exploits? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server.</a></p>

We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that rules out more of The Witcher 4, last seen via a hugely impressive Unreal Engine 5 tech demo in June, any time soon. When might CD Projekt have more to show? Given CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest, perhaps The Game Awards 2026 is a safe bet. According to CD Projekt's latest financial report, 447 people are currently working on The Witcher 4, up slightly from the number reported at the end of July. Clearly, it is CD Projekt's focus right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don’t go expecting anything from Cyberpunk 2, either. CD Projekt recently said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-now-sold-35-million-copies-currently-cd-projekts-main-source-of-revenue-5-years-after-launch">it’s still “laying the foundations” for the sequel</a> while ramping up staff at its development studios. That one’s even further out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we do know of one title that will be at The Game Awards this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-archetype-entertainment">Exodus</a>. The official Twitter page for the game <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that a new Exodus trailer will be shown at The Game Awards on December 11. Exodus is a new sci-fi RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, a studio founded by former BioWare developers James Ohlen, Chad Robertson, and Drew Karpyshyn, and published by Wizards of the Coast.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for that, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">all the nominations for The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <p>The next World of Warcraft expansion, Midnight, will be released 2nd March 2026, Blizzard has announced.</p>
<p>This is the second expansion in the Worldsoul Saga trilogy, which began last year with the launch of The War Within, and will conclude, at some point, with The Last Titan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-cool-world-of-warcraft-stuff-not-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">The Midnight expansion brings several exciting additions to World of Warcraft</a>, the most notable of which is the long-awaited new player housing system, which not only gives you a customisable place to stay, but lets groups of people arrange the locations of their homes into neighbourhoods. "It's kind of a sociological experiment," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has said about housing before</a>.</p>
<p>But there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">some controversy also swirling around the housing system which is related to the new real-money currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a>, with which you will be able to buy furniture and furnishings and other cosmetic items. Hearthsteel, it's called. We'll get a better sense of how this currency and housing works when housing early access opens on 2nd December for people who've pre-ordered Midnight.</p><p>Other expansion features include a new subterranean-themed Alliance race called the Haranir, and a new darkness-themed and damage-dealing Demon Hunter specialisation called the Devourer. Midnight will also take us back to Blood Elf land, to Quel'Thalas and Silvermoon City, which were destroyed before but will be repaired now.</p>
<p>There's also a new open-world PvE-focused Prey system coming to the game, whereby you can mark yourself as 'prey' to enable a hunt-and-be-hunted system that introduces roaming bosses to the world, and in three tiers of difficulty.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>







<h2 id="h-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-to-become-nintendo-studios-singapore">Bandai Namco Studios Singapore to Become Nintendo Studios Singapore</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Partnership. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the DS was gifted one of the all-time great <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alien_isolation">Alien</a> franchise games in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/aliens_infestation">Aliens: Infestation</a>, a slick and polished Metroidvania that nails its mix of puzzling, platforming, signature series tension, and great big scary extraterrestrials (alongside their face-hugging pals). Hey, we even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/10/aliens_infestation_ds">gave it an 8/10 back at release</a>, so you just know it's verified fresh, or whatever they're saying these days.</p>
<p>It's a very good game that you should definitely play, in short. Even if you don't like Metroidvanias or aliens. Because of one song.</p>
<p>As we were happily reminded this very morning, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social/post/3m6lqhazfs22a">via a much-appreciated social media post,</a> of the ending credits song for Aliens: Infestation (below), written by the very same band (Guyz Nite) who penned the also wonderful <a href="https://youtu.be/dH34jMqHBmw?si=9ZQDc0uf6d8PkmUg">Die Hard song</a> (warning for NSFW swearing, but otherwise a treat and a wonderful Xmas song to boot).</p>

<p>If you can listen to this and somehow resist immediately diving back in to replay the whole flipping game all over again, you've got more willpower than this writer. And shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social">@MrHallenback</a> for the Thursday morning levity!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>PC and consoles sent to repair shops come with all sorts of issues, but a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 </a>unit sent to a shop in the United States definitely wins the award for the most disgusting. The system needed to be debugged, in the most literal sense.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Dystopia</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dvdgameexchangeutah/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DVD Game Exchange Repair Center</a>, a repair shop based in Orem, Utah, recently received a broken PlayStation 5 for repairs. After opening up the system, and verifying that the power supply was not to blame, it was discovered that the system was likely no longer working due to a serious bug. Or rather, many of them.</p>



<p>After discovering cockroach droppings all over the system's components, which is disgusting enough, the repair shop rep showed in the video how cockroaches were actively crawling out of the console. The truly literal "debugging," however, will have to be conducted by the owner of the system. The repain center wrapped up the console in plastic to prevent the insects from escaping before sending it back.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He runs a console-repair business. Started the diagnostics, saw what was inside, and immediately decided to pack it up and send it back. Can’t even blame him. <a href="https://t.co/QIrKXSsWqw">pic.twitter.com/QIrKXSsWqw</a></p>— Financial Dystopia (@financedystop) <a href="https://twitter.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Scouring the X thread, other users reported all sorts of disgusting stories, including one about a PC tower case with a black widow spider infestation, so this cockroach-infested PlayStation 5 is hardly the first system to become a nest for bugs. </p>



<p>Still, this stands as a warning to all console and PC users: clear your systems frequently, as they can house something much worse than dust. A small investment of time cleaning now could save you from a truly stomach-churning repair bill later.</p>



<p>Besides having to clean their PlayStation 5 systems as often as possible to prevent issues like the above, owners of older models also need to be aware of the known <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid metal issues caused by a design flaw</a>, which can cause permanent damage to the system. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank">Although it has been addressed in more recent models</a>, it remains</span> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a widely reported issue.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next big event will act as a narrative sequel to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, bringing back Uma Thurman as Beatrice Kiddo as well as Yuki Yibari, the sister of one of Kill Bill Volume 1's antagonists.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge, which will premiere in Fortnite on the 30th November at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>In addition, you can watch it in real life on an actual cinema screen on the 5th December,  where select theatres across the USA, Canada, and the UK will be showing the animated film as well as Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair (a combination of both original movies). Those who purchase a ticket to see this real-world premiere will get a code that can be redeemed for the Gogo Yubari outfit. This appears to be the only way to get the skin as of writing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to sit down and watch the film yourself, you can log in to Fortnite at any point between now and the 1st December to earn a Yuki Yubari in-game skin. She, as you may have guessed, is a main presence in Yuki's revenge.</p><p>This isn't the first time Tarantino has used animation to expand upon Kill Bill. Chapter three of the film, the Origins of O-Ren, used 2D animation to show the backstory of one of its main characters. However, this was included in the movie itself. This is the first time anything Kill Bill has been portrayed away from the silver screen.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players. We'll have to wait and see whether some beloved gory action cinema can replicate similar results.</p>

            <p>UK studio Splash Damage has entered a studio-wide consultation process ahead of extensive redundancies.</p>
<p>The studio has suffered difficulties this year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellation of its Transformers: Reactivate project</a> back in January, which left roles "at risk of redundancy". Then, in September, it was acquired by unnamed private equity investors (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). Previously it was owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, which acquired the studio back in 2020.</p>
<p>Staff were notified of redundancies yesterday, and a public statement was shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">LinkedIn</a>. "This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market," it reads.</p>

<p>"We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout."</p>
<p>The last game shipped by the studio was Outcasters, a shooter exclusive to Google's now-defunct Stadia.</p>
<p>Before that it worked on Gears of War and Halo games for Microsoft in a support capacity.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-dev-splash-damage-teases-aaa-open-world-survival-game-project-astrid">Splash Damage announced its "AAA open-world survival game" Project Astrid</a>, but no further details were ever shared.</p>
<p>News of these layoffs follows a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-announces-mass-layoffs-as-restructuring-plan-pulls-development-from-overseas">"restructuring plan" at Square Enix</a> and the allegedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">unfair dismissal of staff from GTA developer Rockstar Games</a>, both hugely impacting the UK games industry.</p>

			<p>Sweet Surrender is a VR roguelike, and it comes with everything that label brings. You’ll be making your way through the environment picking off enemies, looking for weapons, cash, and upgrades, and swearing every time an enemy shaves off a bit of your health and you come closer to the end of a run. But it’s all in VR, and it’s cool throwing daggers that are somehow poisonous to robots. Oh yeah, everything is a robot – including you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sweet Surrender - PS VR2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcibo6YqOEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Originally launching in 2021 for Quest and PC VR, this PSVR 2 port has come after a bunch of upgrades and additions tot the game. There’s some great twists to the roguelike format and general gameplay, thanks to Sweet Surrender being in VR. The upgrades you can find throughout a level are chips that are fitted into slots by your wrists, for example, but the boosts they provide will only apply to the weapons in that hand, forcing you to really think about what upgrades you’re choosing and where you put them. A revolver that usually only shoots one, very powerful bullet before reloading on an arm with upgrades that triple its capacity and double its damage is a force to be reckoned with, but maybe something that heals you when you find cash would be smarter, to make up for the inevitable health loss.</p>


<p>The weapons themselves are mostly the standard fare – pistol, shotgun, SMG, and so on – but there are more interesting options, such as a katana that burns with plasma when you pull the trigger, or a spear that can shoot electricity. Melee weapons are particularly risky to use, as they force you to get into melee range, giving enemies a good opportunity to shoot you full of holes. Thankfully there are also a bunch of other items you can find, such as grenades, boosters that increase damage, and a holographic shield that feels pretty satisfying to use. At least, until you misjudge it and it runs out of energy in time for a bunch of bullets to the face.</p>


<p>When all this comes together the combat is pretty satisfying, rewarding accuracy for targeting weakspots on the various robot enemies. It’s fast and frenetic, and you can quickly lose a lot of health by getting surrounded. In classic shooter fashion, I found that the best way to fight is to find a bottleneck and take enemies out as they come into view. It does make you feel a bit like a robotic assassin, which is cool, but after a while the temptation to wade in with a plasma sword and a shield comes back because it’s more fun. It’s just that it’s more fun for less time, because you’ll die quicker.</p>
<p>Once you’ve had a few runs, Sweet Surrender starts to feel a bit limited and repetitive. You do have to expect repetition in a roguelike, but you will start to see the same rooms and layouts repeating themselves very quickly. The upgrades and weapons you find can also duplicate and repeat themselves within a run, so there’s limits to how far you can really extend your build.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that this game has very little of the meta progression that has come to define run-based gaming in recent years – it’s a more classic rogulike than a modern roguelite. There are different classes to unlock – Medic, Grenadier, Sniper and Reaper – but there’s no overarching upgrades beyond that, and they don’t actually change the experience all that much beyond some boosts to certain types of damage or more healing. I’ve settled into building my character with one arm for shooting and the other for healing every single time I play, regardless of the class I’ve chosen. Beyond that, you can get shortcuts to let you skip areas, which is nice, but does mean you’re skipping past the items in those areas as well.</p>

<p>Then there are a bunch of immersion breakers and frustraters. Whilst implanting chips into your arm for your upgrades is cool, the experience of actually doing it is a bit of a pain. Just viewing the UI to see your current upgrades is fiddly, requiring a precise twist of your arm that can sometimes trigger in combat and get in the way. I’ve also found the controls to be very finicky for accessing hip holsters,&nbsp;shoulder holsters, and chest item storage. I’m constantly grabbing the wrong thing, including the rifle on your back when you’re trying to get the pistol from your hip, a good foot away from where your hand is.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of dropping things, as the game doesn’t use the PSVR’s touch sensitive buttons, so you’re only holding an item if you’re specifically pressing the button properly. This becomes uncomfortable, but if you switch it to toggle it becomes nearly impossible to throw things properly, so you just have to live with it. Two handed guns like the assault rifle can be a bit awkward to aim down the sight on as there’s some jitter to the tracking, though you can just use them one handed like a pistol anyway.</p>
<p>Sweet Surrender does look pretty good, with a pseudo-cel shaded art style that allows explosions and things like electricity to stand out a bit. It’s not going to astonish you, but it suits the style of the game pretty well. There some nice attention to detail as well, such as there being an actual trigger on the plasma sword that is pulled when you trigger the plasma. The sound is decent as well, with the best bits being the gun sounds and the warning sounds of nearby traps. Again, nothing to amaze, but it does its job well enough.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>'s Midnight expansion finally has a full release date. It'll arrive on March 2nd, 2026, setting in stone the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-player-housing-hits-early-access-this-december-but-only-for-midnight-expansion-pre-orderers">new player housing</a> that's debuting in early access this December and bringing forth the bunch of other changes planned alongside its main invasion storyline.</p>

Why? Reasons, Blizzard have said.</p>

<p>The date was announced via a fresh trailer, in which old and evil void being Xal’atath has a mid-battle snarky line-off with Lor'themar, the ruler of Azeroth's blood elves. There'll be big void beasties who're well into demonic snarling to battle, as Xal’atath unleashes a Voidstorm that threatens to permanently knock the world's lights off if she succeeds.</p><p>You'll be fighting back, infuriated at the very idea of having to fumble around for switches whenever you leave the new digs the expansion's delivering. To be fair, 'Just go away, I'm trying to pick a carpet which matches my drapes and it's VERY STRESSFUL' sounds like as good a battlecry as any. Three different editions of the expansion will be on offer - base, heroic, and epic - with the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2">date announcement post</a> outlining the extras the latter two include via a big chart.</p>
<p>Outside of the player housing, the update includes a new allied race dubbed the Haranir, a nature-focused gang of humanoids who serve as "ancient guardians of the rootways" in their jungle homeland of Harandar. Harandar's one of four fresh or revamped areas you'll be exploring in Midnight, with the blood elves' Eversong Woods, Amani troll-filled Zul’ Aman and the Voidstorm itself. There are three paths through the main story, with the option to head to Zul'Aman, Harandar, or off on a quest to head off with Arator Windrunner and seek some relics of light all being options after kicking things off in Eversong.</p>
<p>If you're keen to delve into the expansion early, sign-ups for its beta are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/midnight">currently open</a>. Epic edition purchasers get immediate access to said beta as part of their forking over of extra cash.</p>

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes another flawed but unique and remarkable bite at the jugular, with plenty to love and loathe alike, but I certainly enjoyed my time as an elder vampire at the very least.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after 30 days on sale, <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox has issued a note to financial markets</a> signalling a write-down valued at 355 million SEK (approx. $37 million) of capitalized development costs for Bloodlines 2. This write-down, Paradox said, was based on an updated sales forecast now it has had a month to look at Bloodlines’ commercial performance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said the blame for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’s failure lay at the publisher’s door, not that of The Chinese Room, which had been drafted in to save the project after years of development hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers’ work on the game,” Wester said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal. A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has two expansions planned as part of the game’s Premium Edition, and Paradox said it remains committed to delivering them. “Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year,” Wester added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish game company Paradox’s main focus is on grand strategy games, which have proven enormously successful over the years. Games such as Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Cities: Skylines have all enjoyed big sales, and, in total, Paradox games have six million players each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, falls outside that core grand strategy genre, and always looked like it would struggle upon release. And while its development trouble began years ago, it suffered issues right up to launch. In September, a month before release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-clans-to-base-game-after-fan-outcry-over-launch-dlc">Paradox and The Chinese Room announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans would be available in the base <u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u> experience following a backlash from players</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced"><u>announced</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u></a> all the way back in 2019 with then-developer Hardsuit aiming for a Q1 2020 release window.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Acquires Splatoon 3 Co-Developer Bandai Namco Singapore]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> in its most recent financial report that it would acquire more gaming studios? Well, it didn't take long for it to actually happen.</p>



<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in a press release that it has entered an agreement to acquire Bandai Namco Studios Singapore from Bandai Namco. So far, the Singapore studio has functioned in a co-development capacity on Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival, Soul Calibur VI, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, and Splatoon 3. Clearly, it is their work on the latter game that caught Nintendo's attention, as clarified in the announcement:</p>



<p><em>BNSS has contributed to the development of Nintendo titles, including the Splatoon series, and has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo. Considering this business record, Nintendo has made the decision to acquire shares in BNSS to strengthen the development structure of the Nintendo Group.</em></p>



<p>Splatoon 3 was released in September 2022 to generally positive reviews. Our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated it 7.5 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Splatoon 3 may be the series’ best entry yet, featuring some nice gameplay tweaks and new weaponry, an expanded and polished story mode, and more launch content than its predecessors. That said, it’s very much an evolutionary sequel, every bit as iterative as many of the shooter franchises it’s meant to be an alternative to. After a five-year absence, that may not be enough for some. Splatoon 3 is still fun and funky, but Nintendo’s squid shooter series can’t get by on freshness alone forever.</em></p>



<p>However, fans of the third-person shooter series really enjoyed this entry. The game has sold over 12 million units to date, making it the fastest-selling Splatoon game.</p>



<p>80% of the shares of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore will be acquired on April 1, 2026, while the remaining ones will be purchased later, once the new subsidiary's operations have stabilized. BNSS will henceforth be known as Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>
