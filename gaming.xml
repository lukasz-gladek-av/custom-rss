			<p>There’s an argument to be had about when Capcom’s brightest moment has been. Was it in the 90s, where Street Fighter 2 practically inventing the fighting scene, while Resident Evil lurched into people’s consciousness? Or perhaps it’s happening right now, with huge franchise hits like Monster Hunter Wilds and Dragons Dogma 2 sitting alongside more esoteric offerings like Kunitsu-Gami.</p>
<p>For me, many of Capcom’s best moments came in the early noughties when they were firing our hits for the Sega Dreamcast like Power Stone, Project Justice and Capcom vs SNK. As luck would have it, that’s the period covered by Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and there’ll be fewer arguments about when the brightest moment was, because it’s now, today, as you can play all of these games on modern hardware, whenever, and wherever you want.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Fighting Collection 2 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMlmm9HoDto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Capcom Fighting Collection 2 pulls together eight iconic games that originally launched between 1998 and 2004, comprising the double header of Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and its sequel, Capcom vs SNK 2.0, Power Stone 1 and 2, Plasma Sword and Project Justice, the enhanced version of Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and the lesser-known Capcom Fighting Evolution.</p>
<p>My first stop had to be Project Justice. This was once the jewel in the crown of my physical Dreamcast collection, and the school-based anime-influenced combat is just as alluring as it was originally. The team-up action forces you to think more carefully about your match-ups and how you approach the 3D space, and the character artwork remains simply stunning.</p>


<p>You’ve then got the complete Power Stone experience, with both the original game and its sequel here in full. All the titles here are the arcade versions, and with Power Stone that seems to ensure that the visuals are just that little bit more coherent and smooth. There’s online multiplayer across the board as well, and that’s enough, frankly, to sell us on the entire collection.</p>
<p>Power Stone is a 3D arena battler for up to four players, and it’s simply incredible to have access to it without having to successfully tune in an RF channel on your TV, or figure out ways to emulate your discs. You smash, mash and bash your opponents with everything humanly possible, aiming to power up via collecting gems so you can decimate everyone in front of you. If you’ve been playing recent arena battlers like Party Animals, it’s easy to see the influence that Power Stone had on the genre, and it still holds up today.</p>

<p>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper is the purest Street Fighter experience on display, and there’s definitely an argument to be had that it’s the best Street Fighter game of all time. The animated visuals are simply perfect, the gameplay is unbelievably tight, and the roster is nigh-on perfect. Being able to take it on the go with the Nintendo Switch is brilliant, with the only weak link being the Joy-Con. I may well have just finished off them off with a heavy week of Fighting Collection play.</p>
<p>It’s almost an embarrassment of riches when we arrive at the two Capcom Vs SNK games. These two titles brought together long-time rivals Street Fighter and King of Fighters, giving you the option of different play styles and team make-ups, and let you loose. I spent so much time playing the original versions of these two, and they’re perfectly presented here. As with Power Stone, the sequel is the superior game, but there are some interesting changes to the control scheme between these two to make it worth spending time with both.</p>

<p>The two lesser-known titles for most players will be Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein and Capcom Fighting Evolution (or Jam if you’re from Japan). Plasma Sword is a one-on-one sci-fi 3D fighter which nabbed a Dreamcast port, and many people will know its lead character Hayato from Marvel vs. Capcom 2. The arcade version found here is so much quicker and smoother than the Dreamcast version ever felt, and while the 3D models are a little simplistic when viewed up close, in action they’re still visually exciting and alluring. It’s a great addition to the collection, and something that fewer people will have experienced.</p>
<p>That’s probably even truer for Capcom Fighting Evolution. While it received ports to the PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox, this has never been considered a top-tier Capcom effort, not least because it’s fundamentally five different games mashed together. There’s characters, art styles and play styles from Street Fighter II, III and Alpha, Darkstalkers and the largely unknown Red Earth, and, though its major draw is letting Ryu fight a dinosaur, it’s far more unbalanced than any other title here. It’s a curiosity, then, and definitely something you’ll want to check out, but there’s less longevity here than the rest of the collection.</p>

<p>Various enhancements make sure that you’re playing the best version of each of these games. From the ability to quick save at any point, access to training modes, rollback netcode for online play, through to the ability to remap controls or perform one-button combos, these games are more welcoming, comprehensive and accessible than ever before. Another great inclusion is access to both the western release and the Japanese version of each title, giving you a complete view of each game, and, if you’re so inclined, the ability to dig into the minutiae of any differences between the two, while there’s over 800 pieces of artwork to pore over in between hitting people in the face.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon.1190958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>An artist has accused Bungie of plagiarising her designs and using them in upcoming first-person shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>. The artist, who creates futuristic posters under the name Antireal (or "4nt1r34l"), posted images of her own work alongside screenshots from Marathon's recent alpha playtest, showing that some designs have been copied. Bungie have confirmed this is the case, but lay the blame on one former artist at the studio.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs i made in 2017," said the artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">on Xitter</a>. "Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The artist compares her work to the designs present in the game. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Antireal</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The images she shares as proof clearly show elements from her posters reused without alteration on objects in the extraction shooter, like walls, containers, and tarpaulins. Another image she made seems to be the basis for designs used during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-gearing-up-to-reveal-something-about-marathon">Marathon's ARG in April</a> and on the game's official website. You can even make out the artist's handle "Antireal" in one of the offending game assets, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billain.bsky.social/post/3lpafnqfaa22x">pointed out by one of her fans</a>. Several of the artists at Bungie, including art director Joseph Cross, have been following the independent artist on social media while working on the game.</p>
<p>"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally," she says, "but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email. </p>
<p>"In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living."</p>
<p>Bungie have responded to the artist's complaints. They say it's true that her work appeared in the game's alpha, but claim this was an "oversight" and only one former employee from their art team is responsible. </p>
<p>"We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game," said the studio in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonteam.bungie.net/post/3lpb36jqb5c22">a post on social media</a>. "This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.</p>
<p>"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission."</p>
<p>But policy is one thing and practice is another. This is the 4th time an artist has come forward to complain that Bungie have used their work without permission, as pointed out by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/artist-accuses-bungie-of-stealing-her-designs-for-marathons-art-i-am-tired-of-designers-from-huge-companies-moodboarding-and-parasitising-my-designs-while-i-struggle-to-make-a-living/">PC Gamer</a>. Last year, they <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1833988238912155813">copied the designs of a Nerf gun</a> in a case that was eventually resolved. In 2023 they <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">copied a design by digital artist Julian Faylona</a> for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> cutscene. And in 2021 they used <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">a fan's art</a> in a trailer without asking. Bungie also still face <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungie-has-motion-to-dismiss-destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-denied-over-vaulted-campaign-storyline">a copyright lawsuit by a writer</a> who alleges the game's Red War storyline stole from his ideas (although it should be said this case is not so cut and dry as the above art nabbings).</p>
<p>Bungie say they will take steps to prevent things like this happening again, and that they'll go through the work of the bus-undered employee to make sure there are not other cases of plagiarism. </p>
<p>"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</p>
<p>"We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them."</p>
<p>It might be fair to read such promises with a wary eye, given the studio's recent record. If you like Marathon's design style, you might enjoy the original work of Antireal, whose posters are <a href="https://antireal.info/">viewable on her website</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Take-Two Interactive's CEO Strauss Zelnick has served up some dutiful, investor-pleasing sentiments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">delay from 2025 release to a 26th May 2026 launch date</a>. Rockstar, he says, are "seeking perfection", and "consumer anticipation is unprecedented". As such, "affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment".</p>
<p>All that's from a hot mix of Take-Two Interactive's latest quarterly financial results and an interview with our colleagues/primordial mythical adversaries at the Ice Giant Network. Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a>, Zelnick commented that the need for "continued polish became clear" as the game neared completion, and that "there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations."</p>
<p>Regarding the inevitable question of whether GTA 6 will be delayed again, he added that "historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it." Which is possibly more true in console land: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> was pushed back once on console from its initial spring window to 17th September 2013, but the PC version didn't arrive till 14th April 2015.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">the earnings presentation</a>, Zelnick reiterated that "affording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment". He also threw in a bit of trivia. Apparently, GTA 6 "began development in earnest in 2020" after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gets-a-second-trailer-but-theres-still-no-date-for-a-pc-version">recent second GTA 6 trailer</a> is supposedly the "biggest video launch of all time, with over 475 million views in 24 hours". Spotify streams of the song from that trailer, Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters, have "surged by 182,000%, once again proving Rockstar's ability to influence popular culture".</p>
<p>This is probably my 9am brain talking, but I find this last point sort of provocative inasmuch as right now, I'm scratching my head a little about the specifics of GTA's cultural impact. It <em>is</em> an undeniable influence on popular culture, be it in the form of moral panics about kiddies playing crime simulators, or in how its urban sandbox has influenced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> designers, or in the vast extent of the modding community, or - yes - in how it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAgUYyosqVM">popularised certain songs</a>.</p>
<p>That said, and for all the game's stature, GTA today is innately and proudly derivative. It skims the froth of American life, sometimes satirically in the form of, say, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Bleeter">Bleeter</a>, and often affectionately in the form of nods to celebrated movies and TV shows - GTA 6's star couple Jason and Lucia are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-anti-heroes-of-grand-theft-auto-6-look-sexy-and-dull">influencer incarnations of Bonnie and Clyde</a>. One consequence of that is a certain hollowness.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is now less than three weeks away from release, which means Nintendo is feverishly filling in the few remaining blanks ahead of the console's arrival. And that finally includes specific details on what each of its previously announced free Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, Pokémon, Mario, Arms, and more will do on launch day.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">announced two different types of Switch 2 upgrades for previously released Switch games</a> as part of its big April news blowout: paid upgrades promising substantial new features or content alongside presentational enhancements, plus free upgrades specifically focused on the likes of enhanced performance and GameShare support.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nintendo announced 12 original Switch titles - including Arms, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and Pokémon Scarlet - would be receiving free upgrades on its new console, but stopped short of providing specific details. That's all changed thanks to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">update on its website</a>, so here's everything we now know owners of the original Switch editions can expect when playing the games on Switch 2 starting 5th June:

The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, these upgrades are free, and are not the same as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_Edition_Games_List">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</a>, which are premium upgrades (or, in the case of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, free upgrades to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what can Switch 2 owners expect? Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, for example, get an “improved image quality” for high-resolution TVs and an “improved” framerate for “smoother movement.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Odyssey, on the other hand, gets HDR support and GameShare support, so two people can play together online, with one player controlling Mario and the other controlling Cappy. All the details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Nintendo's list does not mention framerate fixes for the two top-down Zelda games, which is a strange and disappointing omission given their performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser">our interview with Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser</a> to find out more about the just-opened Nintendo San Francisco store, and all things Nintendo Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo San Francisco Store Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s the list of free updates for selected Nintendo Switch games:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clubhouse-games-51-worldwide-classics">51 Worldwide Games</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Software update release date:</strong> 05/06/2025</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>GameShare support: up to four people can play 34 games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Reportedly delayed to 2026.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Jade Raymond has left Haven Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind online multiplayer shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, with the game reportedly delayed following an external test in yet another blow to PlayStation's live service ambition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Raymond exited the company she founded several weeks after an external test of Fairgames apparently didn’t go down well. The game was due out fall 2025 but is now delayed to spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg put it:</p><blockquote>PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but it came several weeks after an external test of Haven’s first game, the online shooter Fairgames, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Some developers at Haven were concerned about how the game was received and its progress, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is sticking with Haven and Fairgames for now, with new co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski in place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet more trouble for Sony’s embattled live service ambition, which now appears to be in full retreat. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026">launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios, and the now shuttered Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025, meaning by the end of March 2026. Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie is still flying the live service flag, with Destiny 2 ongoing and the in-development Marathon set to launch fully later this year. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games">Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Epic Games has announced that Apple has "blocked" its submission to the App Store and Epic Games Store on iOS, meaning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> won't be available on Apple devices globally for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The news comes around two weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">Epic Games announced</a> that Fortnite would be back on iOS, after a judge filed a major injunction against Apple. A post on the official Fortnite X account reads, "Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> on May 9 that the game had been submitted for review on the App Store, however the company was left waiting an unusually long time without hearing back from Apple with either approval or rejection. Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer website</a> states that 90% of submissions are reviewed within 24 hours, and says developers will be emailed with any status changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496204" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496204"></a><figcaption>Fortnite won't be on iOS devices any time soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg"></figure><p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney recently gave an update on the situation via X, suggesting that Apple may be "weaponizing" its App Review process against Epic. Sweeney said in a reply to another user that Epic Games had followed up with Apple via email on May 13, but still hadn't heard back. On the 14th, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Epic had to withdraw the previous version of Fortnite submitted to Apple and re-submit it due to pending updates.</p><p>"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously," Sweeney said in the X reply. "Our release planning relies on platforms supporting app developers like us releasing apps," he added in a subsequent reply. "There is no way a rapidly evolving multi-platform game like Fortnite can operate if platforms use their power or processes to obstruct."</p><p>"Apple's App Review team should be free to review all submitted apps promptly and accept or reject according to the plain language of their guidelines," Sweeney said in another <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923214117894029475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent post</a>. "App Review shouldn't be weaponized by senior management as a tool to delay or obstruct competition, due process, or free speech."</p><p>Epic Games' legal battle with Apple over its App Store practices has been ongoing since 2020, so it's no surprise that Apple is refusing to give in so easily. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">recent update</a>, judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against Apple in a major injunction, and even referred the case for possible contempt charges. Apple disagreed with the judge's decision and said it would be appealing.</p>

            <p>
Apple has denied <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s return to iPhone in the US.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games announced the news this morning and said the move by Apple would mean its game was now offline worldwide on iOS devices. 
</p>
<p>
The evergreen battle royale had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">back on iPhone in the European Union via the mobile version of the Epic Games Store</a> available in the EU. But this version, too, has now gone dark. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," Epic Games said in a statement on social media. "Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-resubmits-fortnites-us-app-store-request-after-not-hearing-back-from-apple-all-week">Epic Games was forced to pull and then resubmit its application to have Fortnite return on iPhone</a> to ensure it included this week's update for the game - which ended up being delayed until this morning. 
</p>
<p>
According to Epic boss Tim Sweeney, Apple had sat on the submission of Fortnite for days, despite the submission process typically being swift, and had not returned the company's calls. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games and Apple have of course been locked into a long-running feud after the former added in-game purchase options that circumvented Apple's typical store - a move which got Fortnite booted from both the App Store and Google Play on Android.
</p>
<p>
But a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">dramatic legal ruling earlier this month</a> saw a US judge rule that Apple had been wrongly dragging its heels and obfuscating its previously-mandated need to offer a fair payment alternative - something that seemed to pave the way for Fortnite's return. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, Sweeney spent several hours on social media mocking Apple's lengthy submission process - noting that Fortnite knock-offs were available on the App Store (including one titled "Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot"), then <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923120512189763697">remarking that the aforementioned game had suddenly been removed</a> following his earlier post.
</p>
<p>
"Apple's App Review team should be free to review all submitted apps promptly and accept or reject according to the plain language of their guidelines," Sweeney later <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923214117894029475">wrote</a>. "App Review shouldn't be weaponised by senior management as a tool to delay or obstruct competition, due process, or free speech."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Apple for more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-will-be-directed-by-david-leitch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Gears of War film adaptation has found its director. Deadline <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that David Leitch has been selected for the job; he's also expected to produce alongside Kelly McCormick, his wife and producing partner, via their 87North Productions and alongside game developer The Coalition. Leitch is known for movies like Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, Fast &amp; Furious: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, Bullet Train, and The Fall Guy.</p>
<p>However, he won't be working on the Gears of War film right away. Leitch is currently in the pre-production phase of How to Rob a Bank, an upcoming bank robber movie featuring Nicholas Hoult, Anna Sawai, and Zoë Kravitz. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<span>as originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-film-closer-to-fruition-after-bringing-on-board-dune-doctor-strange-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two years ago, Jon Spaihts (who is credited with Prometheus, Doctor Strange, Passengers, and the two Dune movies) is still&nbsp;writing the script for the Gears of War movie</span>.</p>
<p>The announcement of the adaptation <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-netflix-film-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came in November 2022</a>. The movie will be distributed on Netflix, which secured the rights at a time when gaming adaptations weren't so in demand. After the outstanding reception of The Last of Us and Fallout, though, there are more on the way, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mass Effect</a>.</p>
<p>As for new game installments in The Coalition franchise, there's a lot on the way. <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a> is a prequel set on Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde swarmed the surface of the planet Sera, featuring younger versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. It is being developed by People Can Fly alongside The Coalition; there's no release date yet, but we might very well learn more in a month during the yearly Xbox Games Showcase.</p>
<p>This Summer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will bring back the original game remastered and improved for the latest hardware. It will also mark the franchise's debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, now that Microsoft has shifted to a fully multiplatform strategy.</p>

            <p>Fairgames has reportedly been delayed as Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond has departed the studio.</p>
<p>The live-service shooter, published by Sony, is still in development, but a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed Raymond's departure, although a reason hasn't been given.</p>
<p>The report also states an external test of the game took place recently, but some developers were concerned about how Fairgames will be received. The game has reportedly now been delayed from this autumn to spring 2026 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">just like GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests">Rumours of Fairgames' delay</a> into next year emerged back in February. The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jade-raymonds-studio-haven-announces-heist-shooter-fairgame">first announced in May 2023 at the PlayStation Showcase</a>, but little has been seen of the game since.</p>
<p>Raymond previously saw success at Ubisoft as producer of Assassin's Creed and executive producer of Assassin's Creed 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-bloodlines">Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a>. She then left the company to found EA's Motive Studio in 2015, and then moved to Google Stadia in 2018.</p>
<p>When Google closed its internal game studios in 2021, Raymond launched Haven Studios as one of five co-founders. In 2022 Sony acquired the studio.</p>
<p>Raymond's departure from Haven means this will be at least the third game in a row she's worked on but not shipped.</p>
<p>"Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios," a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. "We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added PlayStation is "committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey". New co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will take Raymond's place.</p>
<p>The news of Raymond's departure and the delay to Fairgames is yet another hit to Sony's live-service output. Despite the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> last year, which became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">Sony's plan for releasing over 10 new live service games</a> is rapidly failing.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Concord shut down</a> after just two weeks and Firewalk Studio was closed as a result. Then, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two further live-service games</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Next from Sony will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie's Marathon</a>, the studio's first new game since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. It's set for release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>MMORPG fans can rejoice: <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-to-launch-on-pc-first-in-japan-may-support-cross-play-additional-features-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Protocol</a> lives once again. The anime-styled free-to-play MMORPG originally developed by Bandai Namco Online Studios flopped in Japan, was shut down there, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had its Western release canceled</a>. That seemed to be the end for Blue Protocol, but a developer called Shanghai Bokura Network Technology Co.Ltd has grabbed the rights and is now reviving it for a planned launch this year globally on PC and mobile with cross-play. There's been no mention of consoles, which were planned for the game's original version.</p>
<p>The game is now called Blue Protocol: Star Resonance, although its feature set is essentially the same.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Anime-Styled Visuals</strong>: Stunning graphics create an immersive anime-style world while preserving&nbsp;<span>Blue</span>&nbsp;<span>Protocol</span>’s high-quality visuals.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dynamic Combat System</strong>: Class system, talent build, skill sets, and equipment enable personalized combat style customization, with iterative content updates actively diversifying the approaches.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Open World</strong>: Explore expansive landscapes filled with quests, dungeons, and epic raids.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Deep Character Customization</strong>: Expand character customization, enabling players to craft their own distinct personalities.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Multiplayer Social Experience</strong>: Trade, guilds, and community events enhance the multiplayer experience.</em></li>
</ul>

            <p>Not actually a stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> hybrid of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood"> Blood</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief">Thief</a> - although I'd pay good money for that - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodthief">Bloodthief</a> is closer to something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> but also, I think, much better. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941730/Bloodthief_Demo/">Steam demo</a>'s opening levels are roughly as tricky and demanding as the cyberpunk parkour series but, perhaps to due to less concern with being stylish, the movement here feels a lot more caffeinated. You only have to look at the visuals to clock that Bloodthief isn't that sort of game that's precious about letting you do silly things with momentum.</p>
<p>Also you're a vampire, with a sword, exsanguinating armoured knights in a vaguely Germanic medieval town. Well, Vae my Victus. I do get very excited when anything reminds me, even a little, of Blood Omen: Legacy Of Kain. Here's a nice little video of the game in action. Warning: this trailer for the game Bloodthief has blood in it.</p>

<p>Even in the early levels, the way your various movement options chain together starts to get nicely silly. Wall running itself feels a little loose, but an air dash that lets you grapple to enemies while lining up your next slide lets you clear huge distances in seconds. There's, uh, there's also a missile parry but I won't hold that against it (I've reached critical parry mass at this point). Features? Absolutely, yeah. Several:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bloodthief is an ultra-fast melee dungeon-runner where you use momentum to parkour through hazardous dungeons and brutally slash through enemies. Speed-run through medieval dungeons and castles and learn what dark secrets lie beneath the surface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In Bloodthief you play as a vampire, and the blood of your foes fuels your abilities and propels you to insane speeds. Movement and combat are deeply intertwined—you’ll need to use both in a beautiful dance of skill and carnage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Levels full of branching paths, shortcuts, and secrets reward those with the skill and creativity to pull them off. Find the perfect path through labyrinthine dungeons and reap the rewards for your efforts.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Matthew (RPS in peace) died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghostrunner-review">1423 times in Ghostrunner</a>. I think I might have doubled that in 20 minutes with Bloodthief's demo, but they are the sort of deaths that make a man a hungry for mastery. Also, Wotsits. But mainly mastery. It's a decent sized demo, too, with six levels. The full game is "coming soon", but you can experience the unbeatable taste of Flamin' Hot Crunchy Wotsits right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
15 years ago, I went for a job interview at a small office in Brighton and quickly discovered I was the only one wearing a suit. After years running a Nintendo fansite, I was keen to join a larger team and learn from the very best in the business, whose footsteps I hoped to follow.
</p>
<p>
My first job on Eurogamer was one that no longer exists - it largely involved returning preview discs at the local post office - and I distinctly remember then-Eurogamer editor Tom Bramwell reminding me during my interview that I wouldn't actually be writing on the website. I nodded along, and thought, well, let's see.
</p>
<p>
I've always believed in, and will always be proud of, Eurogamer's mission and place in the increasingly-turbulent world of video games - one that has held fast due to its firm foundations of trustworthy reporting, definitive reviews, and quality critical opinion. It's these values which drew me to Eurogamer back then, and which I know will continue long after I log off for a final time today.
</p>
<p>
It has been the honour of a lifetime to serve as Eurogamer's Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hello-from-eurogamers-new-editor-in-chief">for the last two years</a> and carry this mission forward - in particular, to lead the site through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-25">its 25th anniversary</a>, where the affection and respect for what our team does was felt from readers and the wider industry alike.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
15 years leaves me with too many people to thank, and too many wonderful colleagues past and present to highlight across Eurogamer's editorial teams, video team, tech team, sales, HR, management and everyone else that running a website requires just to get words on a page. I am phenomenally grateful to everyone I have worked with for their insight, patience, and for believing in what we do - and for letting me fill this site with oranges, Birdos and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of that said, please do let me specifically thank three people from over the years: Tom Bramwell for giving me that job and giving in to me writing on the website sooner than I'd expected, Wesley Yin-Poole for his continued belief and guidance, and lastly to Bertie Purchese - Eurogamer's longest-serving staff member - for those days working by the broom cupboard, and for being the heart of Eurogamer ever since.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, it's now my turn to pass the baton on. While I am headed elsewhere in the world of games journalism, I shall always continue to be a Eurogamer fan. I'm excited to see what the team does next in the safe hands of Tom Orry, with whom I leave the site knowing he understands the mission and how to ensure its success in the years to come. Look out for more from him very soon.
</p>
<p>
Until then, and for one last time from me, thank you so much for reading. 
</p>
<p>
Tom

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hideo-kojima-game-design-usb-stick-pitches-productions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up to some weird, if also not entirely unexpected news today: Hideo Kojima<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-a-morbid-one-kojima-has-a-usb-stick-full-of-ideas-for-kojima-productions-to-use-after-he-dies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has a USB stick filled with game ideas</a>, which he wants the staff of Kojima Productions to consult when he retires and/or dies.</p><p>"I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will," he told<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Edge</a> in a recent interview. "Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions."</p><p>"This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP."</p><p>I find this news pretty interesting for a few reasons. Firstly, it's very on-brand for the man. Secondly, it's such a tease: Kojima is 61 years old, which isn't <em>young</em>, but given his apparent good health and the quality of Japan's medical system, it's entirely feasible he keeps working for a very long time, and won't be passing on for a <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Will Kojima Productions even be around in 20-30 years time? Will any of his ideas be workable if the platforms and systems of that future are different to the ones we use today? Will anyone care who this guy was by then? Will we even be using USB? Who knows, there's a lot of uncertainty baked into this plan!</p><p>Which is why I've decided to share my own USB stick full of game ideas <em>today</em>. Having previously been scattered across various notepad files, post-it notes and Word docs, this morning I copied them all onto one of the last remaining USB sticks I had in the house, then copied them right back off into this blog.</p><p>The cons of this plan are as follows: I am not a professional game designer (<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though I have made a game!</a>), don't own a games studio, and my CV isn't stacked with a succession of award-winning titles. The pros: you can read my pitches <em>now</em>, instead of waiting for me to die.</p><p><strong>PITCH 1: Football</strong></p><p><em>Football Manager</em> is one of the most popular video game series on the planet. I love football and video games, but I rarely play <em>Football Manager</em> because the emphasis in the series is on tactics and formations and other whiteboardy numbers stuff. Boring! Being a football manager in the 21st century is actually all about internal politics and media mind games, and so I'd love to make a game where you take the role of a Jose Mourinho-esque manager and, instead of bothering with how many wide players you're going to start against Bournemouth, spend your time arguing with your captain behind closed doors, meeting a young Portuguese prospect's parents for a secret dinner and arguing with an FA official over social media. Something like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/876190/Football_Drama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Football Drama</em></a>, but with the scope and systems of <em>Crusader Kings</em>.</p><p><strong>PITCH 2: Tactics</strong></p><p>As an appreciator of turn-based tactics games, particularly the bigger, broader ones, I've realised my favourite type of missions are never the finely-balanced ones, but those where one side is clearly more powerful than the other, and the challenge doesn't come from beating that evenly-matched opponent, but overrunning an inferior one within a certain set of circumstances, or holding out against a superior one until a certain threshold is met. I'd love to make a game where the asymmetry is the whole point: instead of just trying to beat your enemy, you have to juggle factors like military expenditure, casualties and popular opinion (or, as the other side, affect those as much as possible).</p><p><strong>PITCH 3: Leadership</strong></p><p>Another military game! One of my favourite pieces of television is the <em>Band of Brothers</em> episode “Crossroads”, in which our hero Winters is promoted out of his command of Easy Company, and focuses on his struggles with a new, hands-off role. The idea that his leadership is now reflected in decisions he makes <em>off </em>the battlefield--conversations with his soldiers, keeping up morale, ensuring everyone is supplied and looked after--almost instantly struck me as a very cool idea to build a game around. A strategy game where you do everything but fight the actual battles, and that realises there's a lot more that goes into an effective fighting unit than just moving them around and telling them where to shoot.</p><p><strong>PITCH 4: Drivin' Around</strong></p><p>There's an unwritten rule out there in games development that if you're making a third-person, open-world game set in an urban environment, then that game will feature illegal driving, murderous combat and police chases. I would like to make a game that features almost none of those, because my idea of an urban, exploratory adventure would be based less on <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and more on...<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aQuvPlcB-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dazed &amp; Confused</a></em>. You're a young person, you've got your first car and the only things you need to worry about are making friends, hanging out, romancing someone and driving around to get some food.</p><p><strong>PITCH 5: Space</strong></p><p>The four pitches above are all from the 21st century, when I was an adult and those ideas were working within some kind of realistic framework. But when I was a <em>kid</em>, my dream game was simple: I wanted a game set in space where you could do the flying bits of <em>X-Wing</em>, but also travel around the galaxy visiting various bases and cities (like <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> or <em>Frontier</em>), and at the same time be able to get out of your ship and walk around in a first-person view and do stuff. I realise some games have done this by now--<em>No Man's Sky</em> and <em>Elite Dangerous</em> to name a few--but their scope is fairly limited, and the fact <em>Star Citizen</em> has tried to do something more in line with what I'm thinking, and is in the state it's in, says a lot about how, even today, the dreams of a 90's teenager are still surprisingly out of reach. I really thought we'd be there by now!</p><hr><p>That's it, those are the contents of my USB stick that I will not say was <em>full </em>of game ideas, because they're all tiny document files and there are gigabytes left to spare. But it is at least a USB stick devoted entirely to some game pitches. I hope you enjoyed them, and if you would like to ever make any of them with me while I am still alive,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> please get in touch</a>!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye"><h3>A Fond Farewell To Polygon, From The People Who Worked There</h3></a><p>"It was a good website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fairgame$ developer Haven Studios has lost its founder, Jade Raymond, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj">Bloomberg</a> has revealed. The report also claims Fairgame$ has been delayed out of 2025, and into <strong>spring 2026.</strong></p>
<p>Haven Studios was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-jade-raymond-haven-new-playstation-ip/">announced</a> in 2021, with Raymond making the announcement that she had partnered with PlayStation to form a new team that would be based in Montreal. At the time, Raymond explained that the emphasis behind the studio's name was "<em>to create games that are a haven for players, and we want to build a studio that is a haven for developers.</em>"</p>
<p>A year after that, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-haven-studios-aaa-multiplayer-exclusive-ps5/">PlayStation had acquired Haven Studios</a>, officially bringing it into the PlayStation Studios family, and classifying Haven's debut project as a "<em>AAA multiplayer experience</em>."</p>
<p>A year after that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-new-competitive-heist-experience-fairgame-announced-for-ps5-and-pc/">Fairgame$ was announced</a>, a competitive heist game that has only been showcased through a CGI trailer so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's report, Raymond's departure is happening weeks after Fairgame$ went through an external test, and that developers at the studio were "<em>concerned about how the game was received and its progress</em>."</p>
<p>About Raymond's departure, a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg, "<em>Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</em></p>
<p>Bloomberg also notes that the spokesperson said PlayStation is&nbsp;<em>"committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey.</em>" Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will replace Raymond as co-studio heads.</p>
<p>Before Haven, Raymond made a name for herself as a producer on the Assassin's Creed series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymonds-studio-will-build-ac-like-open-world-action-games-for-ea/">Ubisoft</a>, before leaving<a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymond-comments-swbfii-lootboxes/"> to establish Motive Studio within EA</a>. After a number of years with EA, she was brought in to Google to help get <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia off its feet</a>.&nbsp;And now, the latest chapter in her career has come to an end.</p>
<p>When Sony acquired Haven, former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan was going all-in on live-service games as the future of the PlayStation platform. Since then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-head-jim-ryan-retires-in-march-2024/">Ryan retired</a>, two of the first-party PlayStation Studios teams Sony had working on live-service games have been shut down (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deviation-games-shuts-down-was-originally-working-on-a-live-service-ip-for-playstation/">Deviation</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Firewalk</a>), and PlayStation<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-delays-half-of-its-live-service-games-beyond-march-2026/"> has cut down the number of live-service games</a> Ryan originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">touted</a> the company was going to make.</p>
<p>It's difficult to read Raymond's departure at this stage as anything but a sign that Haven is next to be shut down, meaning it's currently a toss-up whether Fairgame$ even comes out. It also doesn't help that Fairgame$ resembles <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/">another dismally fated heist shooter</a>.</p>

And, you know, that scoundrel fantasy of Kay mixing with the pirate fantasy of Hondo, it just kind of makes sense, right?" Rechner told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we also knew that Kay would be kind of coming into her own, learning what it means to be a leader, and then having someone like Hondo as a mentor - or is he? - we thought it led to really interesting things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC adds a new adventure to the main game featuring the Rokana Raiders crime gang, the Miyuki Trade League who can supply Kay with upgrades for her Trailblazer ship, and a new blaster capability called Shock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws is also getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4, but Rechner refused to spill details on whether the new platform would bring any new features to the game, but did say that there was more information to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of a specific feature set, that's something that we will get into later. So we'll have more stuff to talk about later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the Switch 2's features that the game could take advantage of are controllers that can be used as a mouse and a new GameChat capability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-has-great-optimism-for-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Strauss Zelnick says Nintendo has been "very forthcoming" in addressing third-party challenges.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We're less than a month away from the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, and amid all the turmoil around pricing, tariffs, game key cards, and what-have-you, one third-party publisher says it's feeling pretty good about about the console: Take-Two Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a Q&amp;A with investors today following the company's full year earnings, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Nintendo Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it has been in the past:</p><blockquote>"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. Historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12).

			<p>After so many reassurances that GTA VI would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">arriving in 2025</a>, many players were disappointed to learn that it had been pushed back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026.</a> But Take-Two chief executive officer Strauss Zelnick feels confident that the delay was absolutely the right choice, and that Rockstar needed the extra time as they continued "<em>seeking perfection</em>" with Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a> about the delay, Zelnick admitted that delays cause him "<em>pain</em>," but was resolute that it was the right choice, and that "<em>the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>Breaking down what led to the decision, Zelnick said, "<em>A</em><em>s we got closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear, in this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I feel really good about how Fiscal 26 looks sitting here today</em>," he continued. "<em>And while of course, delays pain me - how could they not? The most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, Zelnick says the choice to give Rockstar more time with GTA VI "<em>is a worthy investment</em>."</p>
<p>Rockstar will clearly get all the time it needs, but now that a date has been put out, Zelnick is sounding as confident as he can without having to directly say that GTA VI won't be delayed again.</p>
<p>"<em>I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it,</em>" is what he told IGN. When asked by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has">The Game Business</a> about announcing the date a year in advance, Zelnick said, "<em>Generally, when we set a specific date, that ends up being the date</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We thought it was important to reassure people that it is coming, and picking a specific date emphasizes that point,</em>" he continued.</p>
<p>So we can look towards May 26, 2026, with at least a bit more confidence than we could at the previous 'release window' of sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Zelnick has previously cited Rockstar and Take-Two's goals for GTA VI, saying that the company is trying to make GTA VI the next "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-development-benchmark/"><em>benchmark</em></a>" for video games and entertainment, that Rockstar is going for "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-never-seen-before-perfection/"><em>something you've never seen before</em>,</a>" and that Take-Two and Rockstar Games are "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-seeks-perfection-says-take-two-ceo-as-updated-forecast-hints-at-fy-2026-launch-window/"><em>seeking perfection</em></a>" with this release.</p>

<p>He's always publicly set the highest bar imaginable for Grand Theft Auto VI, and this is no different. While what we've seen of the game makes it <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">appear to be hitting that bar</a>, we won't know for sure until it's in our hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/668101/apple-epic-games-fortnite-tim-sweeney-app-store-fakes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games has been waiting for Apple to approve <em>Fortnite</em> for the US iOS App Store for nearly a week, and now Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is using X to try and put pressure on Apple. On Thursday, he highlighted examples of <em>Fortnite</em> lookalikes that are currently on the App Store and made a direct appeal to Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923095640394916069">one post</a>, Sweeney included screenshots of the App Store listing for a game called <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em>. A screenshot in the app listing shows a game with <em>Fortnite</em>-inspired graphics, but it’s clear if you look closely that it isn’t the real <em>Fortnite</em>. “Hey @AppStore can we get the real Fortnite up pls?” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923096606972215510">Sweeney asked</a>. </p><p>Soon after, Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923120512189763697">said that</a> <em>Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot</em> had been taken down from the App Store but also highlighted another <em>Fortnite</em> clone, <em>Epic Survival Battle Royale 3D</em>. That app, as of this writing, is still available on the App Store. (Apple has something of a history of letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store">unofficial</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats">fakes</a> of popular games slip onto the store.)</p><p>Sweeney also replied to a post Cook made earlier in the day. “Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought,” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923133214748471391">Sweeney wrote</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">April 30th ruling</a> in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blocked Apple from charging a fee on purchases made outside the App Store, Sweeney announced that Epic would bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the US iOS App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">“next week.”</a></p><p>Epic said it submitted <em>Fortnite</em> to Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">on Friday, May 9th</a>, but the app hasn’t yet been approved. (Apple’s website <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">says that</a> “on average, 90 percent of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours.”)</p><p>Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667206/epic-submitted-a-new-version-of-fortnite-to-apple">said yesterday</a> that the company submitted a new version because “we need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously.” But that updated submission still hasn’t been approved, either.</p><p>“We don’t have an update on our <em>Fortnite</em> submission to the App Store,” Sweeney said <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923081155089183012">earlier on Thursday</a>. “Apple has neither accepted nor rejected it. So the Friday update to <em>Fortnite</em> is now in jeopardy.”</p><p>It’s unclear if that last sentence means that Epic plans to delay the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1923097626460795026">planned Friday <em>Fortnite</em> update</a> for all platforms where <em>Fortnite</em> is available as a result of Apple not yet approving the update.</p><p>Apple and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI has been one of the video game industry's most anticipated games for at least half the dozen years since Grand Theft Auto V first released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Rockstar has obviously had its next mainline entry on its mind for (at least) all 12 years since GTA V, but according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, development on GTA VI only began "<em>in earnest</em>" in <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, he reveals that "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI began development in earnest in 2020 following the massive success of Red Dead Redemption 2,</em>" before going on to discuss how highly anticipated the game is and that the<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/"> new trailer broke records again.</a> During the Q/A portion of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir">today's presentation</a>, while talking about the trailer's traffic in response to a question, he said that Rockstar "<em>broke the internet, again.</em>"</p>
<p>Which is no surprise when you look at that trailer. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/"> incredibly impressive</a>, and the fact that it took Rockstar six years of focused production time to achieve what we've seen so far is a testament to just how incredibly talented the developers and designers at Rockstar are.</p>
<p>Six years isn't the total development time, though, as Zelnick's specification that work began "<em>in earnest</em>" in 2020 implies that pre-production and earlier stages work was going on prior. It's even possible that people at Rockstar moved to work on Grand Theft Auto VI days after Red Dead Redemption 2 launched, putting a more total estimate for GTA VI's development time at eight years, at least.</p>
<p>With at least eight years of development behind it, and nearly 13 years of waiting (if it hits May 2026) for GTA fans, expectations for GTA VI feel higher than they've been for any game. Its closest comparison, you could argue, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-apologizes-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-xb1-performance-promises-patches-are-inbound/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which is a release we'll all never forget for very negative reasons. Let's hope for a different outcome this time.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>This investor presentation marks the first one held by Take-Two Interactive since Grand Theft Auto VI's delay. Despite this setback, the company repeatedly emphasized its upcoming slate of games for 2025--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429" data-mce-href="/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433" data-mce-href="/games/mafia-the-old-country/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> being the most notable--and the gaming industry's projected growth.</p><p>Originally, GTA VI was planned to release in 2025 as well. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/">Rockstar stated that it needed more time</a> "to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve." GTA VI is now scheduled to release on May 26, 2026 for Xbox Series X | S and PS5.</p><p>To help make the wait a bit easier on us, Rockstar recently shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/">new trailer</a> for GTA VI showcasing some of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/">new characters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/">locations</a>, as well as its absolutely gorgeous visuals.

"We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</p><p dir="ltr">Executive producer Marie-Eve Danis and head of production Pierre-François Sapinski will replace Raymond as co-studio heads moving forward, and PlayStation said it is committed to supporting the studio. Bloomberg also reports that as part of this, Fairgames is moving from a Fall 2025 release to Spring 2026, putting it within the Grand Theft Auto 6 release time of May 26, 2026. Fairgames is one of the few remaining live-service games in production at PlayStation after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">unreleasing of Concord</a> and the canceling of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">Blue Point's live-service God of War project</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Raymond founded Haven Studios in 2021 and previously worked at Ubisoft, where she served as executive producer on games that included Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and Watch Dogs. She was also the lead on a Star Wars game called Project Ragtag for Electronic Arts, which was canceled.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts--the publisher behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-648934">Battlefield</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims</a>, and several popular sports series--has announced it is ending its remote work policies, and will be implementing a full return to office. CEO Andrew Wilson stated that this decision reflects the company's desire to foster "kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Wilson delivered the news to employees in a company-wide email sent out on Wednesday, May 14. In it, he explained that "hybrid work" will now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," while "offsite local roles" will be gradually phased out.</p><p>EA Entertainment President Laura Miele then sent a follow-up email to employees, clarifying what employees can expect as the company moves from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model." Below is the outline Miele included:</p><ul><li>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</li><li>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</li><li>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action.</li><li>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</li><li>What this means:  <ul><li>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</li><li>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</li></ul></li><li>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</li><li>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s/my approval.</li></ul><p>As per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN's report</a>, employees within EA are "upset and confused" by the sudden policy change. Some employees will now face "hours-long" commutes, while other have expressed concerns regarding childcare and their ability to manage personal medical conditions. Two anonymous sources reportedly explained to IGN that, per Miele's email, existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime within the next "3 to 24 months."</p><p>EA now joins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">Rockstar Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-workers-in-france-urged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/1100-6526740/" data-ref-id="1100-6526740">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-company-wide-meeting-reportedly-made-employees-feel-extremely-unimportant-and-unsupported/1100-6511643/" data-ref-id="1100-6511643">Activision Blizzard</a> in the growing list of companies doing away with remote work policies.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> are cooking. I'm not exactly sure what just yet, but there's a faint aroma of a new game in the air, and it doesn't seem like they're ready to share anything about the game right now either. Still, after the runaway success of Helldivers 2, something new from the studio is still an exciting prospect. Interestingly enough though, whatever they're making, it won't have anything to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">PlayStation</a> when it comes to funding.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Arrowhead's CEO Shams Jorjani recently shared on Helldivers 2's official Discord (cheers, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">Forbes</a>) that, thanks to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's success, their next game will be fully self-funded. "The wonderful thing is that thanks to the amazing support of you FINE people Arrowhead's future is quite bright and we have the freedom to explore some really cool concepts that we couldn't have otherwise. Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you," wrote Jorjani.
</p>
<p>
After one member of the server asked for whatever said next game is to be available in all regions, Jorjani explained that "the next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." For some context, PlayStation tried to make it so that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">needed a PSN account to play Helldivers 2</a> on PC last year, but that went down so badly they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">dropped the requirement</a>. However, that did lead to the game being pulled from sale in a number of countries where PSN isn't available, presumably why the comment was made by said Discord member.
</p>
<p>
To be clear though, it doesn't sound like Arrowhead's relationship with PlayStation has gone sour, as Jorjani said that the company is "great" and that "there would be no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> if it wasn't for them. We're open to working with them again in the future. They are incredibly game/dev oriented. Solid partners. And this is me just saying it like it is. Not blowing smoke up their asses."
</p>
<p>
I'm sure whatever Arrowhead make next will be on PlayStation either way, but that doesn't really matter to us here does it? Personally, it's just nice to know they'll be able to do things their own way, and not lock out a huge number of people from playing a game for such a ridiculously arbitrary reason.
