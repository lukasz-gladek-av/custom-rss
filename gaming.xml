			<p>SEGA's latest trailer for the next Sonic game calls out Nintendo, and no, we've not time-travelled back to the 80s/90s. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is due out next week at the time of this writing on September 25, 2025, and ahead of that launch, and the release of a demo this coming Wednesday, September 17, SEGA put out a new trailer showcasing CrossWorlds that included a coy call out to Nintendo's Mario Kart franchise.</p>



<p>The trailer is titled, "<em>Come Race on Our Level</em>," and begins with a blurred image of Mario Kart on one screen with a narrator saying, "<em>We all know that kart racing game. It's great. We don't need to show it to you.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But what if you can blast through and race on a whole other level?</em>,<em>"</em> the narrator continues, before diving into a showcase of gameplay from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer goes on to list a few gameplay features in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and before it ends, takes one more shot at Mario Kart, though the second seems more specifically targeted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, by listing a slew of features in CrossWorlds and then saying, "<em>Or, what if you want to roam around on the open road?</em>"</p>



<p>It's all just a bit of fun, of course, but there's a certain tinge of nostalgia the comes from seeing SEGA pull stunts like this.</p>



<p>In any case, players will be able to make up their own minds if Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be worth picking up for their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles or other devices, as a demo will be available on all platforms tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Developer GFA Games has announced today that its upcoming MMOFPS game Pioner will host an Open Beta test at some point in October. The game is still scheduled to launch later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later time.</p>



<p>Pioner was actually already available <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-demo-confirmed-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a limited time as part of June's Steam Next Fest</a>. Following that test, GFA Games shared some adjustments planned for Pioner's PvP mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Current Capture Point Method:</strong> We’re working on making the “Capture the Flag” mode feel more classic. Players will no longer be forced to spend excessive time capturing a flag.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Point Names: </strong>We'll assign point names — A, B, and C — to make it easier for players to navigate the map and communicate with each other.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Enemy visualization in TDM:</strong> We're addressing visibility issues by adding a special type of visualization for enemies (NPCs and players) that makes them stand out against the environment. We're also adjusting lighting components that interfere with visibility.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Player movement:</strong> We’ll work on fixing player movement desynchronization, which can cause noticeable "jitter" in the movement of enemies and allies.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit registration:</strong> The netcode is still being fine-tuned. It’s not fully polished yet, which may cause hits not to register or kills/deaths to happen much faster than intended.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit collision:</strong> We’ll improve hitbox accuracy on certain environmental objects. We tried to identify as many of these issues as possible before the test, but some may still remain in certain areas of the map.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Balance: </strong>We’ve gathered all the current feedback on PvP weapon balance and will make additional adjustments in the near future.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, though, the game generally felt rough during the Steam Next Fest demo. As someone who has been looking forward to Pioner for a while (you might have guessed it from the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a> I previously conducted with GFA Games), I think it could use some additional time in the oven to improve its polish. Still, maybe there was a big improvement in the last four months, so let's check this new build first. Meanwhile, check out the new gameplay trailer embedded above.</p>

            <p>This news story about Fata Deum is written in homage of a random early access Steam reviewer who remarks that if you've never played a god sim before, they're kind of like idle sims. My word, the casually ferocious and embittered atheist poetry of that. Consider my fedora tipped, milords and ladies. I'm off to read the Screwtape Letters again.</p>
<p>Fata Deum isn't just any born-again idle sim. It pays overt homage to Lionhead's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-white">Black &amp; White</a>, with higgledy-piggledy 3D island maps and a familiar hand cursor, used to carry believers to safety or lob them into the sea. There are some significant differences, however. </p><!--more-->

<p>For one thing, you don't get a Creature avatar to first mold in your holy image and then end up squabbling with when you decide to do an Old-New Testament of sorts, flipping from Benign to Vengeful or vice versa midway through a campaign.</p><p>Ah, I remember how my Lion Creature kept extinguishing the houses I smote with thunderbolts, exactly as I'd taught him when he was a cub, and I was a smiling beard in the sky rather than a cosmic arsonist. I'm sorry to see less of that in Fata Deum, but the upside of not having a Creature is that you'll spend less of this god sim cleaning up godbeast turds.</p>
<p>Another difference is that Fata Deum operates around a day-night split encompassing two genres of godliness. By day, you're more of an indirect presence, influencing villagers through visions and blessings. By night, you can intervene directly to make them build stuff and, if you like, raid the dominions of rival gods. </p>
<p>There's a familiar spectrum of Nice and Nasty divine behaviour. You can sacrifice villagers to raise demons or turn the corpses into zombies. Or you can pat them on the head and have them throw wild parties. Or you can mix it up - a little from column Altruism, a little from column Bastard.</p>
<p>There are other gods to worry about. They include deities of Violence, Deceit, Fertility and Pleasure. Each god's behaviour is reflected in the appearance of the terrain. I don't see one for Idleness in the trailers or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330360/Fata_Deum__The_God_Sim/">the Steam page</a> - I guess I'll have to thrash that one out myself, by leaving the PC running for 10,000 years.

</p><p>Developers 42 Bits Entertainment plan to keep this humming along in early access till late 2026. "We firmly believe that reviving the god game genre is a rather difficult task that can only be successfully accomplished through intensive dialogue with the community," they note. Do you consider the god sim in need of reviving? I thought last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a> did a pretty fine job of it myself. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> was one of the most surprising announcements to come out of last week’s Nintendo Direct. It’s yet another remake for the often overlooked PS1-era Japanese RPG, and it’ll arrive amid a recent influx of other<em> Dragon Quest</em> remasters. This one has my full attention, though, and not just because the original game is a sprawling adventure I’ve always wanted to go back to and properly finish. It’s also the art style, which moves past the recent obsession with HD-2D pixel art glow-ups and offers a blueprint for how to revive tons of other beloved JRPG classics.</p> <p>The new “hand-crafted” aesthetic is more akin to the toys-and-dioramas-style visuals of<em> Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> or the<em>&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> remake than what we’re used to getting from Square Enix. <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> <em>Reimagined</em> sits somewhere between the HD-2D retro sensibility of last year’s excellent <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake and the hyper-realistic, Unreal Engine visuals of the <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>remake trilogy, with detailed graphics that exaggerate the storybook whimsy of Akira Toriyama’s original designs rather than running away from them.</p> <p>The big secret to this new look? Scanning actual dolls. Hi-res captures of IRL toys for characters like Hero, Kiefer, and Maribel helped ground the new art style while retaining all of the whimsy. “For this game, we scanned figurines, like this one here, to create the in-game models,” the remake’s producer said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTfUC4MUZs">a short overview</a> with series creator Yuji Horii. “They’re very well done. Using a graphical aesthetic we call the ‘diorama style,’ we’ve depicted the stories and the characters’ emotions in an entirely new way.”</p>

 <p>The game isn’t far away either. It comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 on February 5, 2026 (one small bummer is that the Switch 2 physical version is a game key card only and progress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1nfv3i9/dragon_quest_vii_reimagined_the_switch_2_version/">doesn’t transfer</a> between the two console generations).</p>  <p>Alongside exploring dungeons, engaging in familiar turn-based battles, and tinkering with a meaty job system, <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> revolves around an island-hopping adventure that sees its heroes time-traveling between the past and present as they confront the Demon Lord Orgodemir. It’s a very, very long game, clocking in at up to 100 hours just for the main story. Despite the heft, it was mostly overlooked when it first came to PlayStation due in part to its dated-looking graphics. It didn’t get localized in the West until 2001 after the PS2 was already out and just a month before the arrival of <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>

 <p><em>Dragon Quest VII</em> got a second look when it was remade for the 3DS in 2013 as <i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten</i> <em>Past</em>. It completely overhauled the graphics into 3D polygons and abridged much of the story to shave dozens of hours off the average runtime. <em>Reimagined</em> will make further improvements, including an even more streamlined story and new quality-of-life features like a redesigned UI to make the game easier to navigate. But the most pivotal change will probably be the new “Moonlighting” mechanic that lets characters use abilities from two different jobs simultaneously.</p> <p>We’ve seen Square Enix take all sorts of different approaches to reviving its back catalog in recent years. While <em>FFVII</em> got the full remake treatment, other PS1 games like <em>Chrono Cross</em> and <em>Legend of Mana</em> have simply received HD resolution boosts and additional features that would be considered barebones even by the standards of a third-party emulator. Then there’s stuff in the middle like <em>Dragon Quest III</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> which are ground-up overhauls that still try to remain as faithful the originals as possible.</p> <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a fourth alternative that would be perfect for other games like the original <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which Toriyama also designed the characters for. It even looks perfect for seemingly impossible-to-remake RPGs from other publishers like <em>Earthbound</em>. Players have been sharing fan art of that SNES classic in the style of <em>Reimagined</em> for decades now. We even recently <a href="https://noisypixel.net/earthbound-clay-figure-set-hobonichi/">got new clay models</a> of the main cast that are perfect for scanning. I hope the <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </em>model proves to be viable for projects beyond Square Enix, though I could certainly see it working for something like the long-rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>remake as well.</p>

                <p>Sony has spoken once again about exactly how it is utilizing AI in video game development, which it says allows it to accelerate and streaming the process. The company has already utilized some AI use with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">Spider-Man 2</a> and even tested some models <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">using Horizon Zero Dawn's Aloy</a>. However, Sony believes AI should support creativity, not replace it, according to its own mission statement about its own AI tool called Enterprise LLM, which helps employees across the company use AI safely.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2025 corporate report</a>, since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams have started using this system. Employees are using it not just for chat or writing help, but also by connecting it directly to their daily work tools. So far, Sony has tested more than 300 AI projects, with over 50 now part of regular work routines.</p><p>To make sure AI is used safely, Sony is also working closely with teams that focus on legal issues, privacy, and ethics. In the process, clearer rules are being created for how AI should be used, especially to avoid problems like copying music or other content without permission. The company is also using AI to help protect creators' work by building systems that can detect if something has been stolen or used without approval. At the same time, Sony is using AI to make older movies sound better and to improve picture quality on the PS5 with new upscaling tech.</p><p>Some in the gaming industry agree that changes like these are needed. Masahiro Sakurai, the famous game developer known for Kirby and Super Smash Bros., said big games take too much time and effort to make and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">that the current way of doing things can't last</a>. He believes AI could help teams work faster and smarter, especially in large game studios. Sakurai said only the studios that adapt to AI will be able to keep up in the future.</p><p>AI in gaming is still a hot topic. Some companies, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">Activision, are already using AI tools during game development</a>, but say they don't use AI to replace creative work <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-embraces-ai-but-not-to-replace-humans/1100-6534113/" data-ref-id="1100-6534113">as everything is still "human-created and touched."</a></p><p>Others are more cautious and have genuine concerns. Last year, a deal between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/" data-ref-id="1100-6520224">SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, and an AI voice company called Replica Studios caused controversy</a>. This past May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a group of video game companies made important changes to their offer in an effort to end the actors' strike led by SAG-AFTRA</a>. Since the beginning of the strike, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">which finally ended in June</a>, SAG-AFTRA had pushed for stronger protections around how these digital replicas are used and how actors are paid for them.</p><p>Samantha Beart, who played Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, has criticized the use of AI in the entertainment industry for short-term profit, warning that it could lead to long-term damage. Beart emphasized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-actor-says-ai-could-destroy-the-reputation-of-game-companies/1100-6530278/" data-ref-id="1100-6530278">that actors won't back down in the fight against AI</a>, as accepting it could mean giving up their careers. She added that while the industry is filled with passionate, creative people, it's being influenced by investors who don't play games and are only focused on quick returns.</p><p>Even Microsoft, which had reaffirmed its $80 billion investment in artificial intelligence for 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">openly acknowledged that AI advancements will lead to job losses</a>--a long-anticipated consequence in certain sectors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="borderlands 4 fov" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5ee6d113519ce/borderlands-4-fov.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games/Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure><p>As everyone and their donkey knows by now, Gearbox's latest FPS extravaganza, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, is shooting its way onto Switch 2 on 3rd October, a few weeks after other platforms, and judging by the game's reception on the old aggregator sites, we are in for quite the treat.</p>
<p>Indeed, this writer has been playing the game already on PS5, and it's a cracker thus far. However, the field-of-vision (or FOV if you know all the official lingo) is a bit of an issue, and plenty of folk have been taking to forums and comment sections to complain about it. It's just too close, it feels a tad claustrophobic.</p>
<p>And Gearbox, <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1967001003422871921">it seems</a>, intends to do something about it:</p>

<p>Good news! However, the post above fails to mention the Switch 2 version. An FOV slider, by its very nature, is going to come at the cost of performance, even if that cost is minimal, and so we're left concerned that this particular option may not make the cut in a port that's already had to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-will-mostly-run-at-30fps">cut the frame rate in half</a> to make its journey to Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>FOV sliders aside, and as we mentioned, Borderlands 4 is certainly onto a winner with critics thus far. Indeed, jumping onto Metacritic, it's riding high on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">a score of 84</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review/">Destructoid</a> calling it "easily the best in the series when it comes to gameplay and fun factor, and the best overall game in the franchise since Borderlands 2", whilst <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-review/">Gamesradar</a> reckons the game "extracts the essence of a finale shootout and spins it across an entire game, with a staggering amount of guns allowing for pure carnage." Our pals over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">VGC</a>, meanwhile, said that "Borderlands 4 reminds us exactly why we were such big fans of the original two games, and falls on its sword in learning the mistakes of 3."</p>
<p>Is it gonna be an absolute killer if we don't get this FOV option? Well, no, you do get used to it, but this is one of only a handful of FPS games this writer has ever found a little too zoomed-in for 100% comfort at times. Is it likely to make the cut on Switch 2? Now that's the real question, and 'we don't know' is the short answer. We've reached out to 2K PR asking the question - we'll update if we hear back.</p>
<p>The game is being built from the ground up for Switch 2, developed alongside the other versions, so there's hope as Gearbox is giving the experience due attention for Switch players.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-the-witcher-season-4-premieres-this-october-new-teaser-shows-off-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt.1298331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher is set to begin its fourth and second-last season this coming October 30, 2025, the streaming company has announced, with Liam Hemsworth in Geralt's boots after Henry Cavill left the show. Alongside the <a href="https://x.com/witchernetflix/status/1967075836911030453">premiere date announcement</a>, Netflix also debuted the first proper clip of Hemsworth in the role.</p>



<p>While Cavill got the show going, and Netflix's adaptation is certainly part of what helped get the momentum going in what can now be called a renaissance for videogame to TV and film adaptations, it'll be up to Hemsworth to close out the show as he helms its final two seasons, which were shot all together so once filming ended, Netflix just had to put it together.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Witcher: Season 4 | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQGshAJmdBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As a </em><em>Witcher</em> fan, I’m over the moon about the opportunity to play Geralt of Rivia," Hemsworth said, per a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth">a blog post from Netflix's Tudum website</a>.</p>



<p>Like other streamers, Netflix has added other videogame adaptations since it helped kick things off with The Witcher. It currently has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed</a> show in the works, and on the animated front, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-confirmed/">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is coming back with a second season.</p>



<p>Henry Cavill also isn't done with videogame adaptations, as he's ecstatically working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer adaptation</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as Xbox Series X and PS5. As such, that created a challenge for EA and Battlefield Studios in bringing Battlefield 6 to Microsoft's console. But, at the same time, technical director Christian Buhl noted supporting Xbox Series S wasn't much different than focusing on different performance targets across PC builds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a> interviewed Buhl about Battlefield 6 and asked about the FPS's performance on Xbox Series S. The developer stated that "we don't offer performance and quality as separate options [on Xbox Series S], but it does run very solidly at 60 frames per second at 1080p." That's because it's a "less powerful system," Buhl said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Basically, "the biggest challenge for us, honestly, was memory," according to Buhl. Xbox Series S has 10GB of system memory compared to 16GB on Xbox Series X (in addition to differing memory speeds). "Yeah, it was a challenge, but we also develop for multiple platform targets on PC," Buhl said. "So, it's not like it's something we didn't know how to do." Notably, last month, Buhl told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/">many beta players for Battlefield 6 used minimum specs on PC</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studios-asking-xbox-to-drop-xbox-series-s-requirement-dev-says-system-has-become-albatross/1100-6508459/">game developers haven't held back from lamenting Xbox Series S</a>, even wanting Microsoft to drop the requirement for studios to support the system. Possibly the highest-profile issue was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/">Baldur's Gate 3 coming to Xbox Series X|S later than PS5 because of Series S technical problems</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/">Battlefield Studios shared details about Battlefield 6's battle royale mode</a>, such as the shrinking ring instantly killing players.

<p>Sequel launched in 2022</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bayonetta 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ce48ff36f100/bayonetta-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> launched on the Switch in 2022 and received high praise from critics, but it's fair to say that the reaction from long-time fans was decidedly more mixed. Criticism was raised against the title's more approachable gameplay, lacklustre stealth segments, disappointing visuals, and more, and it apparently had quite the effect on series creator Hideki Kamiya.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/">VGC</a>, Kamiya said that seeing how folks reacted to Bayonetta 3 was a "perplexing experience", noting how fans' ideas of what a Bayonetta sequel should look like didn't necessarily align with what developer PlatinumGames wanted to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I saw with those games was that, as each one was released, the fans’ idea of what Bayonetta is, and what a sequel should be, grew stronger.</p>
<p>"That created a gap between what we at Platinum wanted to do and what fans expected from the now firmly established image of Bayonetta. It was a bit of a perplexing experience for me seeing how fans reacted when Bayonetta 3 was released."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that with the upcoming <strong>Okami Sequel</strong> – which Kamiya is working on at the new studio CLOVERS – he's trying to think "more deeply" about what fans might expect from the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So I don’t necessarily mean to fight that with the new Okami game, but it’s something that I’m trying to think more deeply about how to approach. It’s a very different kind of challenge compared to creating an original title.</p>
<p>"The one thing that I can say about making the Okami sequel is that it’s extremely fun. And just judging by the atmosphere of the office, I think everyone feels that way."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's all a learning experience, right? We're definitely optimistic about the Okami Sequel, and we've no doubt that it'll at least be a worthy sequel to the 2006 original. Target platforms have not yet been announced, but we'd be surprised if the team, along with publisher Capcom, doesn't have the Switch 2 in its sights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames is currently finalising work on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>A few attempts have been made in the past few years to turn the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> into a portable console, but few are as impressive as a recent attempt whose creation has been documented in a video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TERA_PS345">TERA</a>, who has built plenty of impressive DIY console models in the past, documented their second attempt at creating a PlayStation 5 portable edition in a new video which goes over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THm4TCUNmIw">some areas of improvements over the previous attempt</a>, disassembly, cooling system changes to make the new DIY edition of the system possible, the reasons behind the new enclosure and LCD panel choices, component assembly, and more. The end results are extremely impressive from every point of view: the system is quite silent considering the new cooling system even during gameplay, its size is relatively small, and its weight is quite light, lighter not only than the previous attempt but also than a regular PlayStation 5 mode, definitely helping portability.</p>

<p>Although Sony is likely never releasing a full-fledged PlayStation 5 portable edition, the Japanese company already released different edition of its PlayStation 5 system, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-slimmer-revision/">a slimmer version of both the Standard Edition and the Digital Edition</a> that launched in late 2023 alongside a detachable disc drive, and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> model that allows users to enjoy console games at their best thanks to better specs and support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">next version is set to launch next year</a>.

		<p>18 hours and 49 minutes. I cannot remember the last time I spent so much time on a single game this fast. It's just not how my life is built these days. I realize the phrase is overused, but when I am not playing <em>Silksong</em>, I am thinking about playing <em>Silksong</em>. When I loaded up the game to check my hour count for this post, I thought about playing a few minutes. (I did not.) As the Chicago Bears spat in my face for the millionth time this weekend, I joked to a friend that we should just both grab our Switches and play <em>Silksong</em> instead. It would have been a better use of my time, time that would have been respected by such a lovingly crafted hellworld.

              <p>Massive game install sizes and the diminishing role of physical media continue to be frustrating. This time around, <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>’s Switch 2 “physical version” is in the crosshairs. A “Game-Key Card,” <i>Remake</i>’s physical Switch 2 release contains no data itself but will initiate a massive download that’ll Kirby up a ton of the Switch 2’s otherwise generous built-in storage capacity.</p> <p>Despite having a pretty-looking case design, <i>FF7R</i> will ship on Switch 2 with a card that merely serves as a physical license to download a whopping 90GB (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), which is around a third of the spacious (or so we thought) 256GB storage capacity of the Switch 2. But as Switch 2 connoisseurs will point out, Square Enix probably didn’t have much choice. The maximum size of an actual physical Switch 2 game is only 64GB. While file compression can work wonders, <i>FF7R</i> with its <i>Intergrade</i> expansion is just too damn big to fit on a cart.</p> <p>As our comrades at <i>Eurogamer</i> wonder, however, is this Nintendo’s fault for “not offering larger game cards?”</p>

After all, the Switch 2 is clearly making a play to be the premiere place to go for AAA experiences on handhelds–and it’s got the horsepower to do it, as we’ve seen with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a> and even <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, one can buy a 256GB SD card for peanuts (if peanuts is just $25 to you), so why are the Switch 2’s carts limited to just 64GB? It feels like an arbitrary decision that, if Nintendo was invested in physical media and the ability to play a game on a dedicated <i>handheld </i>device without any internet connection whatsoever, it would have made efforts to solve–especially for ambitious (and very good!) games like <i>FF7R</i>.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, 90GB isn’t uniquely large when it comes to AAA games. It’s early days for the Switch 2, so what’s this problem gonna look like as games only continue to bloom in size?</p>

One part of the report that stands out is Sony re-stating its commitment to live-service games despite some stumbles and issues in recent times.</p><p>In the document, Sony said the company "continues to cultivate its live services expertise," citing games like MLB The Show, Helldivers 2, Gran Turismo, and Destiny 2 as examples.</p>

<p>Sony also called out one title that will be important to the company's live-service business going forward: Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. The game was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely</a> and has been caught up in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591"> stolen art </a>claims. The document does not mention any other upcoming live-service games, however, including the reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p>That game is in development at Sony's Haven Studios, whose top boss, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">Jade Raymond, left the studio following apparent concerns about Fairgame$.</a> The game was reportedly delayed and is now said to be<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583"> coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><p>The director of Fairgame$, Daniel Drapeau, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-live-service-game-fairgame-loses-another-key-developer/1100-6534409/" data-ref-id="1100-6534409">left the company earlier this year.</a> These changes, and the lack of mention in Sony's corporate report, do not necessarily mean Fairgame$ is in trouble.</p><p>At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>Sony's biggest failure in the live-service market was Concord, which launched in August 2024 and had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>.

            <p>
Ratatan, the spiritual successor to PSP rhythm platformer Patapon, releases this week in early access on PC.
</p>
<p>
The game has been developed by veterans of Sony Japan Studio, known for both Patapon and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/locoroco">LocoRoco</a> among other games.
</p>
<p>
In a livestream over the weekend, the developers revealed the launch timing as well as a look at the roadmap for the game over the next few months.

<p>
It'll cost $24.99 / €24.50 / ¥2800 (UK price TBC), and receive a 10 percent discount for 10 days following launch.
</p>
<p>
As for the roadmap, three major updates are planned for the end of October, December, and spring 2026.
</p>
<p>
The first of these will introduce Super Fever skills and additional Ratatan upgrades, as well as headwear for Cobun characters and random events. The second update will add Dark Ratatan Battles as new scenarios among other additions. 
</p>
<p>
Next year a new world is promised, as well as console compatibility. For now, the game will only be available on PC, with console releases next year.

			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of 2025's breakout hits. It currently stands as the best-rated game that came out in 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">reached 3.3 million copies sold just 33 days after its launch</a>. Now, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VrnDS-mko0&amp;t=196s">interview</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-quietly-tops-44-million-in-sales-1601503/">Gamereactor</a>, we know that the game has reached another sales milestone, hitting 4.4 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClipsDuLundiV2">Clips du lundi</a>, when technical character artist Amandine Marest, producer Benjamin Dimanche, and senior gameplay programmer Florian Torres were asked about an update on sales, they gave away the goose that, while the public number is "<em>officially</em>" still the previously announced 3.3 million, Marest confirmed that sales had hit 4.4 million.</p>



<p>"<em>Officially, 3.3 million, but it's 4.4 million</em>," Torres then clarified.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's a strong milestone for an indie game that in many respects came out of nowhere, despite being featured in multiple Xbox showcases. Sandfall Interactive's story is not uncommon in the videogame industry. A studio born out of developers leaving the triple-A space, looking to make the kind of game they've always wanted to see, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/">inspirations drawn from games they loved</a> is old-hat in this industry. </p>



<p>It's less common for studios that share those origins to find the kind of wild success Sandfall has found, especially when considering how much of a game's sales can be eroded by being available through a subscription service, like Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>And by the sounds of it, Sandfall isn't looking to waste the opportunity it has with this first game's success, as it is looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/">build out Clair Obscur into a wider franchise</a>. </p>

			<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will be more than simple ports of the original running at a higher resolution, as they will feature some noticeable visual improvements.</p>



<p>In a new video shared online today on YouTube, GVG compared the footage released so far, which includes a five-minute-long uninterrupted gameplay video shared on the official website, detailing some of the unspecified visual improvements confirmed shortly after the collection's <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">announcement.</a> Among these are some significantly improved textures, though not all of them will be enhanced, judging by the footage, improved fonts, and re-rendered cutscenes with a new aspect ratio, which look better even in a comparison based on the compressed footage available. As all the footage has been captured from the Nintendo Switch version running at 1080p resolution, the two games should look even better running at 4K resolution on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides visual improvements, Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will include some new features over the original Wii release and the Super Mario 3D All-Stars port of the first entry in the series. Among these new features will be an Assist Mode to make the games more accessible, the ability to listen to the soundtracks of both games, and more.</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will launch ahead of the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, also called Galaxy, on October 2 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-ip-snapped-up-by-experienced-collective-of-video-game-leaders.1298241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new "experienced collective of video game leaders" has snapped up the IP rights to Phoenix Labs'&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, and the group says it plans to ensure the game's "enchanting online experience continues to flourish".</p>

<p>Per a press release, the collective, which consists of four distinct gaming-related entities, has acquired the rights to both the existing&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>game and "ongoing IP" concerns. This appears to mean the game's online services, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september" rel="nofollow">shut down earlier this month</a>, will once more be made available to players.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it seems the collective intends to do more with the&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>IP; in the press release, the group says players can "look forward to exciting future announcements that will add even more magic to their Azoria adventure".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=4KME5rvX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=GKyHFAbe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fae Farm</em>'s future isn't looking quite so bleak now, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, who's part of this new collective? There are four entities that are now responsible for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, namely Gambit Digital, Game Cloud Network, Pure Wonder Interactive, and Phatty Acid.</p>

<p>Gambit Digital is a publisher based in Montreal, Canada, and it's part of the city's <a href="https://www.indieasylum.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Indie Asylum</a> collective. The publisher says its mission is to put its weight behind "bold games and the teams behind them".</p>

<p>Game Cloud Network <a href="https://www.gamecloudnet.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it's "on a mission to create the world's largest brand engagement network", so it seems the company is more focused on the marketing and engagement side of things rather than out-and-out publishing.</p>

<p>As for the final two entities in the list, I wasn't able to find much on Pure Wonder Interactive, but Phatty Acid, assuming it's the same company, <a href="https://phattyacid.studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">appears to be</a> a "generative AI studio". That doesn't bode particularly well for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s future.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's a cozy life sim taking place in the "enchanted world of Azoria". You'll meet "charming characters", take part in activities like cooking and potion-making, and generally make a comfortable little life for yourself in this fantasy land.</p>

<p><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> supported 128 player matches at launch in 2021. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will support 64 player matches, when it launches on 10th October this year. Some mistake here, surely? Battlefield 6 is a sequel to Battlefield 2042, and sequels are supposed to have More. If I have just given voice to your innermost thoughts, then I fear it is time to bamboozle and horrify you with the nightmare-physics of the arcane game design proverb, "sometimes, <em>less</em> is more". 
</p>
<p>
"But how can this be?" you shriek, as the ground crumbles and the walls peel away. Matter cannot increase and decrease simultaneously! A "+1" cannot be a "-1"! You reach for the whiskey bottle in a frenzy, but it is too late to unlearn this awful knowledge. Anyway, stop screaming so I can treat you to another morsel of insight from Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil. I promise this one won't hurt quite as much.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We thought larger player numbers would work - it just didn't catch on," Uchil said to Edge Magazine in recent reflections about Battlefield 2042's higher headcount, as passed along by the magazine's jovial e-buddies at <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-goes-back-to-64-players-per-match-because-2042s-128-person-matches-just-didnt-catch-on-design-director-admits-look-we-try-stuff-sometimes-it-works-sometimes-it-doesnt/">Gamesradar</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's like when a band tries a new sound," Uchil continued. "Because we like it, but then players don't - and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want." I feel "subservient" is perhaps a bit much, Mr Uchil. Please do not encourage your players to think that they're pharaohs. How many pyramids did the pharaohs build, all by themselves? Exactly. 
</p><p>
As digested by GR, Uchil added that "Battlefield players are very vocal" and will "tell you what they want" as regards the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. Definite deer-in-headlight vibes. The devs "all read the Reddit," Uchil added, because it's "the number-one source, and all of us are on there." All of which continues the well-established EA marketing theme of trying to get 2042 haters on-board with Battlefield 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">designed to evoke the better moments of Battlefield 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like thinking about how many players is too much in first-person shooters. The question of player count is obviously part of a larger set of questions about map design and size, mode design, weapon balancing, and so forth. Generally speaking, when I'm pinned down by a bombardment in a Battlefield game, it absolutely feels like there are 127 other players out there, because those artillery impacts are so very loud. 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, I remember playing Resistance 2 on PlayStation 3, which boasted then-mindblowing 60 player headcounts, and finding that the flagship multiplayer mode's objective structure had the effect of making it feel like a bunch of asynchronous deathmatches. We'd pass queues of enemy players hurrying in the other direction and just sort of wave acknowledgement, like passing bus drivers.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) had similar thoughts about Battlefield 2042. He found that it rarely felt like a 128-player game at all. "I’m not sure I notice the bump in bodies," Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">wrote in his review</a>. "Sure, things are chaotic, but the maps are so vast to make up for it that the pockets of violence remain similar to previous, smaller entries in the series." 
</p><p>
The obvious tentpole game to invoke here is Planetside 2, proudest of the surviving MMO shooters. I had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-after-fortnite-theres-still-something-essential-about-the-mmofps">unravelling PlanetSide 2's accomplishment</a> in January 2024. Amongst other things, I argued that the vast periphery of each emergent battle makes for a surprisingly good walking simulator. But enough of my wittering. How many players do you consider too many players, inasmuch as such things can be interpreted out of context?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">still sell millions of physical copies</a> of games every year, but that’s not where they make the bulk of their money. As Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">latest corporate report</a> shows, physical game sales for PlayStation 5 and PS4 are practically a rounding error on a rounding error, and the number just keeps going down. The total percentage of revenue from physical software sales is now half of what it was before the PS5 launched.</p> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment made <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sie-fy24-revenue-31-5b-9-operating-income-2-8b-43-software-sales-17b-14-hardware-18-5m-11.1188738/">roughly $31.5 billion</a> in its last fiscal year, which ended in March. That was up nearly 10 percent from the year prior as gaming works overtime within Sony to bolster the company’s financials. But within its games and services division, AKA PlayStation, only 3 percent of that revenue came from physical games. That’s still $945 million! Nothing to sniff at, for sure, but also a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the skyrocketing division.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000625711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625711"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625711">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s also the lowest share of PlayStation revenue that’s ever come from physical game sales. For the year prior to the PS5’s launch in 2020, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2020_E.pdf">Sony reported</a> 6 percent of revenue came from discs. The next year it dropped to just 5 percent. That number stayed flat for a few more years before dropping to 4 percent in its 2024 corporate report and then 3 percent this past year, half of what it was at the end of the PS4 generation. One reason the number might have been so low last year? Even fewer first-party Sony games than usual, which hardcore fans traditionally buy more physical copies of.</p>

 <p>While the percentage of overall sales that physical games make up for PlayStation continues to decline, the fact that the total revenue from those physical games isn’t falling as fast could be one reason Sony might be thinking of keeping a disc drive as an option for the PS6 but moving away from having it as the default. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">recent report from<em> Insider Gaming</em></a> claimed the next-gen console will continue the detachable disc-drive trend where an all-digital machine is the default and players have to pay extra to utilize their physical media.</p> <p>Each console maker is currently grappling with the transition away from physical games in their own way. Many first-party Xbox games don’t even ship with a physical version anymore, and Nintendo’s controversial game key cards for the Switch 2 mean that the majority of third-party games on the new handheld hybrid don’t truly have a physical version either. The PS5 console cycle could end up being the final nail in the coffin for physical game media.</p>
