            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published a <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/nintendo-switch-2-launch-what-early-digital-data-reveals-for-third-party-games">new report</a> looking at the data from early digital sales on the Nintendo Switch 2, as Newzoo's product manager, Max Otten, tried to get an early answer to the question of whether the Switch 2 is a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and publishers.</p>



<p>Otten looked at digital sales data for June 2025 from six major markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, and saw that three out of the top five games by units sold on the Nintendo Switch 2 were third-party titles. At the top of them all? Toby Fox's long-awaited Undertale follow-up, Deltarune.</p>



<p>Deltarune doing well isn't the biggest surprise, considering that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">a week ago</a>, Newzoo reported that it had made it into the top-20 games by revenue for June 2025. However, that knowledge doesn't exactly wear off the shock of seeing it over top of Mario Kart World, though this is where it's important to remember that the sales data Newzoo is pulling from does <strong>not</strong> include physical sales. In the US alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">82% of people who bought a Switch 2 also bought Mario Kart World in a physical forma</a>t, so it makes sense that the digital sales aren't as chart-topping as you might expect.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though perhaps the most surprising aspect of Newzoo's report is seeing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in second place behind Deltarune, and ahead of Mario Kart World in third. Otten's guess at what happened here, while accurately calling Welcome Tour "<em>essentially a tech demo</em>" in the same breath, is that the combination of its "<em>low price and lack of launch-window exclusives likely helped drive</em> <em>sales</em>."</p>



<p>Rounding out the rest of the top five is Minecraft in the number four spot, and No Man's Sky in the number five spot, and once again, at least one of those games is not the third-party title you'd expect. Minecraft isn't a surprise, but No Man's Sky is, at least slightly, when considering that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37qmdfn2k">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2 has been one of the standout third-party releases so far, at least in the US.</p>



<p>That top five changes slightly when Otten looks at which games that were exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 had the biggest revenue share, with Mario Kart World in its expected top spot, followed by Fantasy Life I in second, Cyberpunk 2077 in third, No Man's Sky in fourth and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in fifth, making it once again a three-to-two third-party games majority.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, the only top five Otten shows in his report, where the majority of games listed are first-party Nintendo titles, is the list of top five titles by monthly active users for June 2025. Mario Kart World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons take first, third, fourth, and fifth place on that list, respectively. Fortnite is the only third-party entry in the number two spot.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>All this said, Otten closes his report by saying that "<em>While first-party titles command overall sales leadership, there are clear pockets of spending on third-party content—especially for games that are well-optimized, offer genre diversity, or present new experiences to the platform."</em></p>



<p>He adds that "<em>early data shows glimmers of promise for third-party titles at launch, and players are showing up for enhanced ports, narrative games, and non-traditional Switch genres.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll learn more about how viable the Nintendo Switch 2 ecosystem is for third-party titles the deeper into the console's life we go. Only looking at first-month sales in select major markets and sticking with digital sales is nowhere close to the whole picture. But Otten has shown how even new third-party titles can find chart-topping success. It'll be interesting to see what else is able to top the charts in the coming months. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hypnohead have announced that their roguelite kingdom-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first four days on release.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date" rel="nofollow">on Monday this week</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/TKIWGame/status/1948672902137811139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account, it's already hit the 100,000 sales mark. That puts it in good company, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pioneers-of-pagonia-100k-sales" rel="nofollow">Pioneers of Pagonia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">beaver colony sim&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hypnohead and tinyBuild <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753900/view/542237641778661281" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that free content updates are in the works for&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, with features like mid-run saves being "actively work[ed] on", according to the two studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=9k9uY5oa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=D-9_d71p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has reached an impressive sales figure in just four days.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, it's a roguelite kingdom-builder in which you must construct and maintain your kingdom, but with a unique twist (which the title has probably already given away).</p>

<p>As the king, you must actively watch areas of your kingdom you want to progress; if you don't, they will fall to "laziness" and "chaos", as the Steam page says, but watching them will result in progress "thriv[ing]".</p>

<p>You'll have to balance which parts of your kingdom you most want to succeed. Do you want to emphasize resource production, for instance, or defense to make sure your kingdom won't be caught unawares?</p>

<p>As you play, you'll gain upgrades that will allow you to watch more of your kingdom at once, and you'll also need to make decisions about where you want to invest the resources you've gathered in order to make your kingdom the best it can be.</p>




<p>Since this is a roguelite, you'll also have to deal with unique events that can significantly change the outcome of a run. Each run will allow you to unlock new abilities to help your kingdom thrive in future.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently on sale for $13.49 or your local equivalent (although that's with a 10% discount).</p>

The port allows players to guide the politics and people of New London with the palms of their hands, on controller and thumbsticks alike.</p><p>Several improvements help tailor the control scheme for gamepads and provide quick access to vital <a title="Genres > Action [2,888 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Players can use bumper buttons to cycle between districts of the same type, or a dynamic radial menu that appears over resource piles and presents actions specific to them. Additionally, following the console release, the PC version of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> will receive an update enabling players to use this new UI scheme whenever a gamepad is connected.</p></blockquote><p>“Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible [from PC to console],” said <em>Frostpunk 2</em> production coordinator Igor Skibinski in a press release. “But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless—so players never have to think about how to play while they’re playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex <a title="Genres > Strategy [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>

<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish.1253265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With just a month to go before the game's planned release, the Dying Light: The Beast team has announced a delay.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we've ever released," <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moves">Techland wrote in an update</a>, stating that to "honour" this promise it would be delaying the release until 19th September. This will allow the team to add some extra polish before the zombie shooter gets released into the wild.</p>
<p>"We've been carefully listening to what you've been saying - whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments," the Dying Light: The Beast developer continued. "With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great."</p>
<p>This extra time will see Techland making some adjustments to cutscene and player animations, as well as finetuning the balance of gameplay elements. It also aims to make the game's UI clearer.</p>
<p>"We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand," Techaland said "Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we've learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is."</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">first look at Dying Light: The Beast during Gamescom last year</a>, when Techland revealed this release initially started out as DLC. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience," the studio wrote at the time. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a> Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."</p>
<p>Then, last month, the studio announced an August release date (which has obviously now changed). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Techland also released a new trailer</a>, featuring new gameplay, along with a variety of chases and parkour - a key feature in Dying Light games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions">it was reported Techland had cancelled two in-development games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157588/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Ever since I was a kid stomping his feet to pop songs in <strong>Dance Dance Revolution</strong> and getting pep talks from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/parappa_the_rapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a> about how I gotta believe, I’ve been a fan of rhythm games. And while I love popular juggernauts in the genre like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/guitar_hero_5">Guitar Hero</a>, I’ll always prefer something with more originality than just simply holding down a button, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/theatrhythm_final_fantasy_curtain_call">Final Fantasy Theatrhythm</a>.</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a>, a quirky blend of rhythm and strategy originality released exclusively on Sony’s PSP and now out on other platforms thanks to Bandai Namco. You play as a god to the charming Smurf-esque creatures and use drums to direct them during missions. Your controller buttons correspond to a rhythmic phrase. Want them to move forward? That’s easy! <em>Pata pata pata pon!</em> Need to attack? No problem; just hit ‘em with a <em>pon pon pata pon</em> combo. Keep the beat going and you’ll enter into a Fever, which increases your attack and defence.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a novel concept for a game. You’re completely detached from the Patapon who worship you because you’re viewed as a god. It’s by far more preferable to having an actual in-game avatar because it easily lets you slip into your role as the Patapons’ saviour. You can’t help but grow attached to the Patapons themselves. They’re just lil’ eyeball guys! In a lot of ways, it reminds me of the connection you form with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>. You <em>want</em> to protect your Patapon because they’re yours.</p>
<p>The gameplay is largely simplistic but that’s not necessarily a detriment. In fact, the game works better because of its simplicity, especially when it comes to the general gameplay loop.</p>
<p>You’ll be doing a lot of grinding missions over and over to collect Ka-Ching and other materials that let you create stronger Patapon units, of which there’s a decent variety, from spear throwers to archers.</p>
<p>That grind might sound annoying but the missions in both games are bite-sized little morsels, so you aren’t locking yourself into 10-minute missions or anything worse. I suspect this is because both games were originally on the PSP and it was better for the missions to be quick and snappy rather than long and drawn out. Regardless, it works in each game’s favour.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157592/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But don’t go into Patapon expecting a Guitar Hero clone. Patapon utilises rhythm, but personally, I’m hesitant to call it a rhythm game. It’s more of a strategy game that uses rhythm than a rhythm game with strategy elements.</p>
<p>That also means you shouldn’t go in expecting a toe-tapping soundtrack. Patapon’s usage of rhythm doesn’t necessarily make for good music to listen to. You may only be playing percussion but Drum Hero this ain’t.</p>
<p>There are issues, however. For starters, you can’t pause the game, which is frankly ridiculous in 2025. You can work around this by pressing the Home button rather than a pause button, but it’s still ridiculous. And I can’t count the number of times I was so close to entering Fever mode only to screw up by being the tiniest bit off beat. Sometimes it seems like you have enough space to attack only to realise you need to keep marching forward.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157589/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And worse, it’s very easy to throw off your sense of rhythm when it comes to things like boosting your defence. You can chalk it up to being a skill issue but while you can alter the button-press delay in options, you can’t test your changes out without going into a mission and then exiting it, which is incredibly frustrating and time-consuming.</p>
<p>One thing that can’t be complained about is the aesthetic of the games. There’s an almost moving comic book-like quality to these little eyeball monsters. They’re absolutely adorable to look at, and it’s fun watching them follow your commands in battle by throwing spears or cutting up enemies. And the backdrops in the missions are absolutely beautiful, with crisp shades of reds, yellows, blues, and more. Patapon oozes style in spades and its aesthetic is its biggest strength, even over the gameplay’s.</p>
<p>Patapon is fun to play in docked but I’d argue that it feels best in handheld mode, harkening back to its earlier PSP days. There’s just something about plugging in your headphones and chilling on the couch while sending your Patapon army into battle. The performance is largely the same between docked and handheld, so you won’t be missing out either way.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay is a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony. It’s simple to play, but if you dig deeper you’ll find that there’s a real meaty game here. The rhythm-based controls make it unlike any strategy game you’ve ever played before. There are some small frustrations, but generally it succeeds in what it tries to do.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-epoch-developer-eleventh-hour-games-acquired-by-krafton.1253250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleventh Hour Games, the developer and publisher of hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch</em>, has announced that it's been acquired by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>forum, Eleventh Hour founder Judd Cobler, also known as moxjet200, says Krafton was the right choice for his studio because the publisher "shares [Eleventh Hour's] passion for the ARPG genre".</p>

<p>Cobler says the partnership between Eleventh Hour and Krafton will give his studio "the opportunity and resources to execute on [its] goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre", which is a lofty goal indeed given just how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">competition</a> there is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=fMd3ZiI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=arPPcM7g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>developer Eleventh Hour Games has been purchased by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Cobler, he spoke to "dozens of strategics and potential partners" before settling on Krafton, having decided that the partnership will guide Eleventh Hour through "some of the largest upcoming challenges [it will] face as a studio".</p>

<p>This is far from the first acquisition Krafton has made in recent years. Back in August last year, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks and its&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP</a>&nbsp;following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown at the hands of Microsoft</a> (which, in retrospect, would seemingly prove to be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">start of a pattern</a> for the tech giant).</p>

<p>Prior to that, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" rel="nofollow">snapped up&nbsp;<em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>studio Neon Giant</a> in 2022, which itself followed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">purchase of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>developer Unknown Worlds</a> the year prior.</p>

<p>The latter would prove to be a somewhat poisoned chalice for Krafton; earlier this month, the publisher fired the former heads and founders of Unknown Worlds, prompting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;in which said founders alleged their ousting (and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay</a>) was part of a plot to avoid paying employees a sizable bonus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=Es2mWZNo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=sd_v0HTC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's other acquisitions include&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>studio Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly how Krafton's acquisition will affect Eleventh Hour, well, Cobler says it won't, really. He <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482/4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> his studio will remain a subsidiary under Krafton and won't be merged into the publisher; in fact, new staff will be hired soon, apparently.</p>

We’re blushing about quotes like “nailbiting survival <a title="Genres > Horror [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>,” “absolute blast,” “project with a soul,” and being called a “standout game of 2025.” It proved the gut feeling that we had already—we’re making a very special, fun game.</p><p>It also proved that the <em>Dying Light</em> community is the best. The preview coverage has been viewed by millions of players who looked at every detail of the game with laser focus eyes, highlighting, discussing and getting excited about thousands of details. We’re spending time effortlessly, reading and collecting your feedback and opinions and making sure that your voice is heard and we know exactly what’s important for you.</p><p>It has always been our goal to make <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> the best <em>Dying Light</em> game we’ve ever released.

        <p>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</p><p>We’ll keep you busy this summer with regular updates from the studio and a playable demo at Gamescom in Hall 6. Starting next week, we’ll also share an update on the game’s gore and you’ll meet our good friend Bober the Beaver again.</p><p>We’re almost there so please bear with us for the remaining eight weeks—we can’t wait until you finally unleash the Beast on September 19.</p><p>With the best regards from the entire team at Techland,<br>The Developers of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-to-september-19]]></content:encoded>

Well, you might be in luck because the upcoming game has recently been given an age rating, suggesting that it may be getting a release date pretty soon.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, a listing for Metroid Prime 4 has gone up on South Korea's <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">classification board</a> where it is currently rated for "ages 12 and up" due to mild violence. The content of the listing itself doesn't reveal much else about the content of the game, but the filing does suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is indeed closing in on the finish line and could still stand to release later this year, where it's being pegged as a holiday release at the moment.</p><p>Additionally, VGC reports that the listing comes around the same time that it's been hearing of an imminent Nintendo Direct, where it is believed that a formal release date will finally be provided.</p><p>It's been a long road for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced at E3 in 2017, the game has changed developers and undergone at least one reboot before being re-announced with the subtitle Beyond back in 2024. Since then, there's been a steady drip of information, including the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">first hands-on previews</a> earlier this year, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-out-now-poster-spotted-in-london/1100-6532578/" data-ref-id="1100-6532578">bizarre advertisement</a> in the London Underground that falsely claimed the game was "out now."</p><p>Now, Metroid Prime 4 seems likely to launch by the end of 2025 on both the Nintendo Switch, which it was first announced for, and its successor, the Switch 2.</p>

<p>However, as rumours of a Nintendo Direct continue to build, a rating for the game in <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0">South Korea</a> (shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m8u5ge/metroid_prime_4_beyond_has_been_rated_in_korea/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> subreddit) has fans hopeful that the game isn't far off.</p>
<p>The rating doesn't really give away anything, but it looks like it was filed on 10th July 2025 but was only published today.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 has been a <em>long</em> time coming, so many fans are scrambling for any sliver of information they can get. As always, a rating doesn't mean anything, so try to keep your expectations in-check.</p>
<p>But, as we mentioned above, the timing also lines up with those Nintendo Direct rumours, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">NateTheHate reiterating that one is still coming this month</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">VGC</a> has also said that reports of a Direct "match up" with what the outlet has also heard.</p>
<p>With next week being the final week of July, will we see a Direct? And, will Metroid Prime 4: Beyond get a release date? Time will tell. That <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">London Underground poster blunder</a> got us all a bit <em>too</em> excited...</p>

Alongside the fixes, all players will receive the game's original soundtrack DLC as a form of apology.</p><p>The patch notes detail the addition of a manual toggle for low latency mode, which is now no longer enabled by default, as well as VRAM optimization for lower-end GPUs. 505 Games says it has also fixed an issue where the game may crash immediately after the company logo during startup. It has also resolved a stuttering issue during finisher animations.</p>

<p>Players that preordered both the Standard and the Deluxe edition of the game will receive the correct content rewards after the patch update.

<p>Other updates on the way include New Game Plus mode, which will be available starting July 29. Selecting this mode will reset your story and objective board progression, but you'll get to keep all of the skills, gear, and knowledge ranks you've earned, as well as your Hideout progression. You won't have to sit through tutorials on your playthrough, as you can fast-forward to the end of the prologue chapters.</p><p>The level cap is being increased from 60 to 80 for all players, and new Mastery ranks, Knowledge Skill ranks, and upgrades for all Hideout buildings--including new upgrades for Heiji's Forge--are on the way. Several big quality-of-life upgrades will arrive in a September update, before the Claws of Awaji expansion goes live. Here's a closer look at what's on the horizon:</p><ul><li>Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog will completely lift</li><li>The ability to skip time-of-day, jumping ahead to dusk or dawn</li><li>A new Forge upgrade level to reach Mythic--from Epic--and Artifact--from Legendary--equipment rarities</li><li>Hideout updates and upgrades.</li><li>Uncapped framerate for cutscenes on PC</li><li>Additional "goodies" that might be familiar to long-time series fans</li><li>Further bug fixes and stability improvements</li></ul><p>In related news, Ubisoft recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">Assassin's Creed Shadows has crossed the 5 million players mark</a>, and the company teased that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints" rel="nofollow ">could arrive on new platforms in the future</a>. The game has so far "performed in line with expectations," Ubisoft says, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/" data-ref-id="1100-6533378">live-action Netflix series adaptation</a> of the franchise is finally in development, five years after it was first announced.</p>

            <p>He plays Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but can Pedro Pascal actually <em>play </em>Mister Fantastic? Well, when it comes to Marvel Rivals, no not really.</p>
<p>The cast of Fantastic Four: First Steps recently got to take their Marvel Rival's counterparts out for a spin. Joining Pascal was Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), who all played NetEase's shooter with YouTuber LoserFruit.</p>
<p>It is fair to say though, that none of the actors were especially skilled when it came to negotiating the controls, with Pascal looking very much out of his depth (at one point he asks if there are "console classes" people could take part in).</p>

<p>But, one moment from this entire Marvel Rival's experience that has particularly captured attention, though, is the cast's reaction to Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which leaves very little to the imagination. "Thank you," Kirby immediately reacts with a snap of the fingers. "This is my favourite bit of her as well." She then makes allusions to a yet-to-be-greenlit sequel.</p>
<p>Her three companions, though, well they all looked rather surprised by the scantily clad image presented to them on the screen, which sees Sue dressed in what looks like quite a skimpy bikini bottom complete with a spikely-adorned top half. 

Pascal soon regained some composure, and simply said: "Costume designer, take note."

</p><p>This clip was shared by the Marvel Rivals social media account, and the cast's reaction has since gone somewhat viral. So, what do you think about Pascal and co's gaming endeavours?</p> <div>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

		<p>Another week is in the books, and we’re just a month away from Gamescom, so I’ve spent a good bit of time cleaving through emails and trying to put a sensible schedule together for previews and hands ons. Still some more to do on that front, but my calendar is pretty packed…</p>
<p>But enough about that, because with the cooler, wetter, windier weather, it’s been a good time for a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/le-mans-ultimate-v1-0-can-fill-my-endurance-racing-void-this-summer/">Le Mans Ultimate</a> to come out, luring me to put on my fancy hat to check out a game dedicated to one of my favourite sports. It’s pretty darned good!</p>
<p>With a poorly baby in the house, <strong>Nic</strong> hasn’t played much this week, but did give the new Pokémon puzzle game a quick try –&nbsp;“It’s not worth downloading…” So let’s move swiftly on to <strong>Jason</strong>, who’s been playing an awful lot of the “basically perfect” Monster Train 2, but has also jumped back into Final Fantasy XV after losing his enjoyment for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy old week for <strong>Steve</strong>, as usual, and he’s been playing an unholy mix of Hellclock, Once Upon a Puppet, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/s-p-l-i-t-review-hacking-horror/">s.p.l.i.t</a>, while also having another two indie horror games on his forthcoming review list. We can also add in the Chibi-Robo spiritual successor Misc. A Tiny Tale, the classic CRPG A Necromancer’s Tale and a certain 2D Ninja platformer. It’s lucky it’s not term time right now!</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> week has been filled with Neverwinter Nights 2 Remaster and Peglin for review, but he’s also been playing Death Stranding, Civ VI, Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>Having been able to sneak a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, <strong>Aran</strong> has also had Birdigo and Atomic Owl on the go for review. It’s a rather different sci-fi zombie and horror future for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, though, who’s been reviewing Killing Floor 3, and sinking back into The Callisto Protocol: “I think I’m on the last boss battle I’ve kinda enjoyed the whole thing. However I never ever, ever, ever, ever want to see a character stand on a platform only to have it give way under the so they are separated from their partner, ever again. The game does it about ten times!”</p>
<p>While he’d been looking forward to playing it, <strong>Ade</strong> was thoroughly underwhelmed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> –&nbsp;“Maybe I’m just all soulsliked out?” –&nbsp;so it’s good that he’s been able to move swiftly along to Achilles Survivor for review, which offers an Ancient Greece twist to the Vampire Survivors formula.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing his car combat quest with Twisted Metal World Tour, where he grabbed the platinum trophy. “It’s a shame the genre has been left behind – Sony’s Destruction All-Stars was a fun time even if it had some glaring flaws.” He’s also been playing Wildgate, which has a rough onboarding, but which he’s enjoying for its spaceship extraction shooter shenanigans.</p>

<p>And we come to <strong>Dom</strong> to wrap things up, and he’s been playing a mix of Donkey Kong Bananza, Wild Hearts S and the recklessly titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/super-mario-party-jamboree-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. There’s also been some CarX Street, and some real life chess, which I assume means he dressed up as a bishop, went to a field, and moved diagonally when someone told him to.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=Y6RIMyVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=FaYlAqVJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>needs a few more weeks before it can be unleashed.</figcaption></figure><p>Areas that Techland will be working on between now and the new September release date include gameplay balance, "clarity of UI", physics quality, and animation tweaking, as well as the addition of "last little details".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dying-light-the-beast/9p7zg9mqkkln" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

        <p>A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an "enigma of success"</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have published a memo recently sent to staff by CEO Sayta Nadella, which addresses the strange fact of Microsoft reporting net income in the ultrabillions while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laying off thousands of supposedly "treasured colleagues"</a>. Most of the blog is a gusty, jargony paean to generative AI technology, in which Microsoft have made vast investments, and how it is going to "empower everyone to create their own tools" and create a "local surplus" of Ability To Do Stuff in Microsoft dominions worldwide.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>

Nothing in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">blog</a> directly addresses what Nadella characterises as the "seeming incongruence" of Microsoft being richer than all of the Roman emperors combined, and still taking a blowtorch to video game studios like ZeniMax Online Studios, King, Rare and Sledgehammer Games. But I guess it's nice that they've recognised that the optics are weird.
</p>
<p>
"By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right," Nadella writes. "We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.
</p>
<p>
"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value," he continues. "Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding."
</p>
<p>
Ah, whomst amongst us can fathom the dissonant enigma of trillion dollar corporations spontaneously having layoffs happen to them, while doleful executives float by on golden balloons, scratching their heads with bloody hacksaws. 
</p>
<p>
In other news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sources-suggest-that-staff-laid-off-at-king-will-be-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-helped-to-create">reportedly</a> been replacing developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> with the generative AIs they helped to "train". Satya Nadella is apparently <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/the-surprising-way-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-uses-ai-to-consume-podcasts-on-his-commute/">a religious genAI user</a>, and I do wonder whether that's a "local surplus" of capacity that could justify some further cost-cutting, as per the glorious mysteries of progress.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Techland’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was set to release mid next month, August 11. However, in a press release published today, the developer has announced an eleventh hour delay to the zombie-fighting parkour game, moving the release date to September 19. It is “to allow for extra polishing,” including improving the UI, boosting physics, and tweaking cutscenes and player animations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,195752,197562" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The follow-up to 2022's <em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human </em>was originally intended to be the second major DLC for that previous game, but after overenthusiastic fans unearthed and leaked everything about the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671?_gl=1*12ruh1t*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM0NDA1ODckbzIwJGcxJHQxNzUzNDQxNDIxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">the developers decided to entirely rethink the project</a></span>. This led to the desire to return to 2015's original <em>Dying Light</em> hero, Kyle Crane, now a super-human half-beast man, the result of ten years of brutal, tortuous experimentation.</p><p>Earlier this week there were a bunch of hands-on previews published across various sites, and given that a delay has been announced just a few days later, you might imagine significant issues were raised. However, from reading through a bunch of these previews of the first four hours, people appear pretty jubilant about what they played. In fact, Techland’s own statement notes the same, describing the mostly YouTube coverage as “universally positive.” However, it seems the developers spotted something the critics did not, as they’ve now decided to hold things back for an additional month of polish.</p><p>  “With just four additional weeks,” says the press release, “we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.”</p><p>Given the short nature of the delay, and the relative specificity of the intent, this does sound more purposeful than the the ambiguous notes you’ll often read when a game slips its release date. It does seem hard to imagine what can be dramatically changed in just four extra weeks, especially with elements as integral as the UI, but it’s definitely far better than receiving these improvements in piecemeal patches <em>after</em> the game’s released.</p><p>So <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will now be out September 19, in the safe release territory left behind after <em>GTA 6</em>'s delay into next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-delay-techland-1851786943]]></content:encoded>

<p>So who might Spaeny be playing in the Elden Ring film adaptation?</p>
<p>We don't know yet what the plot will focus on and which characters will be included. A safe bet would be Melina, who acts as the Tarnished's maiden along their journey.</p>
<p>Other options include Ranni the Witch, Malenia, or perhaps even a female Tarnished.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">Elden Ring live-action film was announced back in May</a>, with Garland as writer and director. Garland is also known for Ex Machina and Warfare.</p>
<p>Heartstopper star Kit Connor is also said to star in the film, after featuring in Warfare.</p>
<p>Film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco are both behind the project, though it's unclear if FromSoftware or the game's creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> are also involved.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">Elden Ring team announced its co-op spin-off Nightreign had passed 5m copies sold</a>, while DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has now soared past 10m downloads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-romulus-star-reportedly-in-talks-for-elden-ring-film-role]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Atari 2600 was my very first home console. When my friends were playing on Megadrives and PCs, we were slightly less well-off, and that meant I was a couple of generations behind (let’s not think too hard about the gaming obsession I clearly developed after this). Still, I loved my Atari, and there’s a reason that classic games like Space Invaders, Centipede and Asteroids remain ‘classic’. They’re just great games. Perhaps the most iconic title, though, from the Atari 2600 era is Pac-Man and as the 35-year anniversary celebrations are rolling out, Atari and Bandai Namco have seen the opportunity to commemorate the event with a brand new Atari 2600 console. This rendition, named the Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition, takes the original, wooden-build of the first Atari 2600, and replaces it with bright yellow, Pac-Man-coloured plastics, while adding in the console’s first wireless joystick, also crafted in eye-melting yellow as well.</p>

<p>This is a fully-functional Atari 2600, so you can play any original cartridge. In the pack you’re getting the Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, a dual-game cartridge that includes Pac-Man 7800, a brand-new, arcade-style version of the classic, along with PAC-MAN 2600, the very first home console release of the game. I imagine that means the + in the 2600+ name means that there’s slightly more power on tap here than the original hardware, though probably not much more than is totally necessary. There is a non-yellow version already available, and the key improvement is that the 2600+ is capable of running Atari 7800 cartridges. While the older version is cheaper – <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atari-2600-Plus-Exclusive-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B0CG9SVRJY/ref=sr_1_3?crid=UFJ1I07PHLXT&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ODU4K6ROKmK2jVjWcN5mWOtLKpkJpxtwS6JHHgXYmTINyK9LwZzOwhIRa4HgJI4F6A_I9A3rOcvDqRuuC1ETQUEVO4Sd3shnVu4yVg79MKgDXpCSLXfRbtlBrc5cdQhB27JvULWy-wavrqsdWv0GJ3I0ryicK_-0tGW3Lhtcezwi4pK2u3XFE0_LMQiwx3m8b1ffbpsB88xY0qzlypvL0SCymRvEugjPKo5QDyqKsJE.lTHnMBJZXIfGLx6Qee8MSOVcTCO1V2aePkCzuHk-P8o&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=atari+2600%2B+pac+man&amp;qid=1753441872&amp;sprefix=atari+2600%2B+pac+man%2Caps%2C77&amp;sr=8-3">currently&nbsp; £64.95</a> – and truer to the original build, it doesn’t include the new wireless joystick.</p>


<p>There’s going to be a full range of wireless joysticks, with five in total, complementing the colours of Pac-Man’s ghostly adversaries, and they’ll cost £29.99 each. I assume that there’s going to be wider functionality for them, perhaps via Bluetooth or a wireless dongle, but there are few extra details on these right now.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release, Plaion Replai’s Commercial Director, Ben Jones, said, “The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console – it’s a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man’s unmistakable style, we’re celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play. We’re proud to bring this collaboration to life for collectors, fans, and a whole new wave of retro gaming enthusiasts.”</p>

The release date for the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition and Pac-Man CX40+ Wireless Joysticks will be 31st October 2025. There will also be a separate release of the PAC-MAN Double Feature cartridge later in 2025.</p>
