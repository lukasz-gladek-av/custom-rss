		<p>After <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">a metric ton of rumours and reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been revealed, showing off the revised design of the hybrid console sequel and confirming a 2025 launch.</p>
<p>Watch the reveal trailer here, with a Nintendo Direct for a full reveal set for 2nd April 2025. In-person preview events are also planned – confirmed for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience">New York, LA and Dallas in the US</a>, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1879883063137648723">London in the UK</a>, and other regional venues.</p>

<p>Today’s Nintendo Switch 2 announcement is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 is coming out in 2025, with Nintendo reconfirming that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>

<p>The much-anticipated successor to the Switch has been heavily leaked over the past year or so, but it’s reached a fever pitch in the first few weeks of this year. Already being expected through 2023 and 2024, Nintendo took the unusual step of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">stating repeatedly that it will be announced before March 2025</a>, and clarifying before every stream that they would not be discussing it. Thankfully we can put all that behind us. Kind of. There’s still a lot of information to be confirmed by Nintendo about the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since then there’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer <a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit</a> (though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>

			<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially revealed today with a new trailer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The short trailer</a>, which can be watched below, uses the original consoles as a basis to show how the hardware will change in its next iteration with a bigger screen, different Joy-Con controllers, and more. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">previously rumored</a>, the new trailer doesn't provide much information on the games, showing only a seemingly new Mario Kart game that has yet to be officially confirmed, and confirming only that the system will be fully backward compatible with both physical and digital original Switch games. The trailer doesn't even provide a precise release window past the generic 2025 window, but thankfully, it seems we won't be left in the dark for a long time, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be aired on April 2nd.</p>
<p><iframe title="An update from Nintendo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides providing a better look at the new system in April, Nintendo also confirmed that in select cities around the world, players will be able to get hands-on with the system. These cities include New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto in North America, Paris, London, Milan, Berlin, Madrid, and Amsterdam in Europe, Melbourne in Oceaniakyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Taipei in Asia. Ticket registrations, which require a Nintendo Account, will open tomorrow, January 17th. More information on these hands-on events, including dates for each city, can be found <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Officially Announced, Direct Coming in April]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced-direct-coming-in-april.1083870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally officially announced the Switch 2, putting an end to months and months of speculation. What's more, a Direct presentation is coming with more information in April.</p>

<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official Nintendo account, Nintendo shows off the console, which does indeed appear to feature many of the rumored improvements, including magnetic Joy-Cons, a bigger screen, and a redesigned dock.</p>

<p>Nintendo also says you'll be able to play both Switch 2 games and original Switch titles on the new machine, although "certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=uDHqZxsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=4cvp3yOZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the Switch 2 in all its glory.</figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's Joy-Cons will, it seems, lose the bold color scheme of the originals; instead, the default Joy-Con controllers will be all-black, although their analog stick housings will sport the Switch's traditional blue and red.</p>

<p>Additionally, the inside of the Joy-Cons, where the SL and SR buttons are located, will be blue and red, as will the magnetic housing on the console itself.</p>

<p>A new kickstand will also be present on the Switch 2, and it looks a lot sturdier than the original Switch's equivalent. Our very own Stretch has done the math, and he reckons the kickstand tilts by about 150 degrees.</p>

<p>It looks like the Switch 2 won't be making too many changes in terms of ports, either; the USB-C socket will once again be located on the bottom for charging and attaching to the dock, and you'll also have access to a headphone jack.</p>




<p>We knew a Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">announcement was coming sometime before April</a>, and rumors had suggested that the announcement would come today, so it's nice to have the console out in the open at last.</p>

<p>Of course, right now, Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding hardware specs, so we don't know how much more powerful the Switch 2 is than the original Switch.</p>

<p>It does, however, look like some kind of new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game will accompany the launch of the console; the trailer shows what seems to be a new entry in the phenomenally popular racing series, although I suppose it could also be&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>with yet more new courses.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo will be revealing more about the Switch 2 during a new Direct presentation on April 2nd. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-project-taken-down</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-project-taken-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ambitious&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>mod Liberty City Preservation Project has been shut down, but contrary to what you might think, the mod's developer insists that the takedown wasn't due to a DMCA request on Rockstar's part.</p>

<p>In a message shared to the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879611635343741349" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameRoll on X</a>), modder nkjellman says that the choice to take the mod down was made "due to the unexpected attention" the project received, and that a decision was reached "after speaking with Rockstar Games".</p>

<p>However, in a <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879683899015700852" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, nkjellman clarifies that the takedown "isn't a DMCA" but rather "a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved". The modder says there's "no negativity between [their team] and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=LYAOCXcD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=OeJ0uke4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Liberty City Preservation Project is no more, but it wasn't taken down because of a DMCA, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The modder goes on to say that you shouldn't download LCPP from unofficial sources because they "may contain malware", and that users also shouldn't share download links in the Discord server.</p>

<p>Of course, although nkjellman says the takedown was "friendly" and that Rockstar didn't issue a DMCA, that doesn't mean it wasn't Rockstar who unofficially requested the mod's removal.</p>

<p>It's very possible that if nkjellman and their team had refused to take down LCPP, a DMCA would have been the next step, so even though a DMCA wasn't issued, it could well have been the threat of a DMCA that caused the modders to take down the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, one thing's for certain: you won't be able to get Liberty City Preservation Project from official sources anymore, so I hope you've already got the mod downloaded if you want to keep playing it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XhxeCzuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XTo3oq5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is well-known for its hawkish stance on modders.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what the Liberty City Preservation Project mod was, it was an ambitious attempt to essentially mod the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>into the&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>engine, complete with the whole Liberty City map to explore.</p>

<p>In a way, it's not surprising that it's been taken down. Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is notoriously hostile towards modders, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-adds-gta-underground-list-killed-mods" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> several&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-related <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">modding projects</a> in the past.</p>

But the console will be backward-compatible with both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games — though the video cautions that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.”</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Findex.html">is promising</a> to share more details in a Nintendo Switch 2-focused Direct on April 2nd, 2025. The specific time will be shared “at a later date.”</p><div><p>Your first chance to try it could come at a series of events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas that are scheduled over several days later in April, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116009204/en/">according to a press release</a> — ticket registration <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-switch-2-experience%2F">will be available here on Nintendo’s website</a> starting January 17th at 3PM ET.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 console.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch will be a tough act to follow. The device was a clever hybrid of a home console and a handheld, and the formula resulted in one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">bestselling consoles of all time</a>. A huge part of the console’s success was that it was home to some of Nintendo’s best-ever games, including hits like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a>, and the very popular <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/21/15382628/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-best-features"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a><em>. </em>Fortunately, you’ll be able to play all of those games on the new console — Nintendo said in November that the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">will be compatible with Switch games</a> and will have Nintendo Switch Online.</p></div><p>The first Switch was also a massive sales hit. The company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">says that</a>, so far, it’s sold 146.04 million units, making the console its second-highest-selling video game system behind the original Nintendo DS, which sold 154.02 million units. The Switch’s sales figures also mean that it has surpassed the Nintendo Wii (101.63 million units), the Game Boy (118.69 million units), and the Nintendo 3DS (75.94 million units).</p><p>While we’ve been waiting years for a true Switch successor, the console had mid-cycle hardware refreshes along the way. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> was a great way to play Switch games on a smaller device, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> added a beautiful display and a handful of other nice upgrades.</p><p>Starting in December, supposed information about Nintendo’s next console began to trickle out from accessory manufacturers. Dbrand, for example, gave us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">what it believed</a> to be actual dimensions of the hardware and said that its “understanding” was that the Joy-Con controllers would be magnetically attached. And at CES 2025, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">a 3D-printed mockup</a> of what it believed the Switch’s successor would look like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn’t get a the release date today beyond the fact that it’s coming sometime in 2025, but we did get the official name. Switch successor is indeed called the Nintendo Switch 2. How un-Nintendo of them!</p><p>The trailer shows off a bigger, sleeker upgrade to the 2017 hardware that’s sold over 150 million units. The new Joy-Con are black instead of red and blue, and the right one has a new, mysterious c-button. They attach to the screen—which is larger with a smaller bezel—with magnets. But Nintendo still hasn’t gone into detail on the official specs or what the hardware will be capable of. It looks cool though:</p><p>A quick segment near the end of the trailer appears to show the upgraded Joy-Con moving like a PC gaming mouse, possibly an allusion to a new optical tracking capability. The company also reiterated that the Switch 2 will play Switch games, but with a major caveat. “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2,” a disclaimer at the end of the trailer reads. It’s unclear which games will be included in that carve-out, but more information is promised on Nintendo’s website at a later date. </p><p>Nintendo’s official Switch 2 reveal comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">after weeks of alleged leaks purporting to show everything</a></span> about the new console from its motherboard to its new magnetic Joy-Con connectors. The sum total of the rumors amounted to the new device being an upgraded Switch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307?_gl=1*1r5k8ox*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjg4MjQyMy4yNzcuMC4xNzM2ODgyNDI3LjU2LjAuMA..">with a bigger screen and a more powerful processor</a></span> but otherwise largely the same hybrid gaming tablet everyone’s come to love since the original launched back in 2017. And they basically all turned out to be right.</p><p>Whether the Switch 2 can pull off a similar year-one coup will depend mostly on what first-party exclusives the system launches with. The one-two punch of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was a powerful recipe for success with the original hardware. Can the Switch 2 muster a similarly impressive lineup? <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, which certainly looks like what’s been revealed in the Switch 2 preview trailer, would make for a great start. </p><p>One thing that might help is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175">steady drumbeat of third-party ports from Xbox, Ubisoft, and others</a></span>.

It looks like the Switch 2 could launch with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>. One of the most notable differences between the game we saw and previous <em>Mario Karts</em> is Donkey Kong. If you look at the gorilla racer in the background of different shots, you’ll notice he looks pretty similar to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>counterpart, rather than the classic design seen in games like <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Some fans have observed that Mario’s proportions seem to be a little more cartoony and similar to the recent <em>Super Mario Wonder</em>, as well. So while Nintendo didn’t officially put a name to the footage, it’s a pretty reasonable leap to assume this is <em>Mario Kart 9</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been combing through the brief bits of footage to determine some of the playable racers, and the roster we can see includes: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Daisy, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, and what appears to be Paulina, Toadette, a Goomba, and a Koopa.</p><p>We’ll get a better look at the next <em>Mario Kart </em>and the Switch 2 in April, as Nintendo has confirmed it will hold a Direct presentation on the system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During this event, players might learn more about the upcoming console’s capabilities and what new games will be playable on it. The Nintendo Switch 2 release date, pricing and availability should also be revealed on this date, considering the console is set to release in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day has finally come as Nintendo has officially announced the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, the worst kept secret in video games.</p>



<p>In a short <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two-minute video</a> online (watch below), Nintendo confirmed the full design of the upcoming console. Confirming the look <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s been leaked</a> in recent months. The console comes in black and will feature a more rounded look, a newly designed kickstand with a wider tilt, a new-look dock, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and more. With the Joy-Cons also being black, the red and blue color of the original appear under the thumbsticks.</p>



<p>There’s also the new button on the right Joy-Con, but its purpose wasn’t confirmed during the reveal video.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as games go, the teaser only showed what appears to be a new Mario Kart game running on the console. More information about the console and (likely) its games will be shown during a <strong>Nintendo Direct event on April 2</strong>. One thing confirmed during the reveal is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only play digital</a> Nintendo Switch games, but it will also play physical Switch 1 games. </p>



<p>That said, the company did state that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” More information on that will come “at a later date”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it was revealed that Nintendo will be holding special “Nintendo Switch 2 Experience” events in April in three United States cities: New York City from April 4-6, Los Angeles from April 11-13, and Dallas from April 25-27.</p>



<p>You can check out the video below.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has officially revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, its successor to the wildly popular Switch console. Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a hybrid home and handheld gaming console, but with beefier system specs and several other improvements when compared to its predecessor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the reveal trailer, Nintendo confirmed that the Switch 2 will be backward compatible with most physical and digital Switch games. "Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2," the company added. More details on the Switch 2 console are set to be revealed in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April 2, 2025.</p><p>The trailer also revealed the Switch 2 controllers in more detail, confirming the new magnetic Joy-Con design. Compared to the first iteration of the Joy-Cons that slid into position via rails, the Switch 2 controllers snap into place on the console. There was also a brief look at what appears to be a new Mario Kart game, but other details on the exact launch date, price, and system specs are still being kept under wraps for now.</p><p>Anyone looking to go hands on with the console won't have to wait too long, as Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events have been announced. This will be a global event, taking place in multiple major cities.</p><h3>USA</h3><ul><li><strong>New York:</strong> April 4-6</li><li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong> April 11-13</li></ul><h3>Canada</h3><ul><li><strong>Dallas:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Toronto:</strong> April 25-27</li></ul><h3>Europe</h3><ul><li><strong>Paris:</strong> April 4-6</li><li><strong>London:</strong> April 11-13</li><li><strong>Milan:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Berlin:</strong> April 25-27</li><li><strong>Madrid:</strong> May 9-11</li><li><strong>Amsterdam:</strong> May 9-11</li></ul><h3>Australia</h3><ul><li><strong>Melbourne:</strong> May 10-11</li></ul><h3>Asia</h3><ul><li><strong>Tokyo (Makuhari):</strong> April 26-27</li><li><strong>Seoul:</strong> May 31-June 1</li><li><strong>Hong Kong:</strong> TBA</li><li><strong>Taipei:</strong> TBA</li></ul><p>Since last year, Nintendo Switch 2 leaks kicked into overdrive thanks in part to third-party accessory marketing. Nintendo had previously claimed that information on the Switch successor would be revealed by the end of its current financial year--which draws to a close on March 31--but it remained quiet on any other details regarding the console.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Switch still has several great games releasing later this year. Donkey Kong Country Returns lands on the console on January 16, strategy fans can check out Civilization 7 in February, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition looks like it'll gobble up dozens of your spare hours, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> could be an exciting return to the pocket monster franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-shell-nintendo-finally-unveils-the-tktk-its-successor-to-the-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wait is over. Nintendo has finally pulled back the veil on the Switch 2, its successor to the immensely popular Nintendo Switch. It's currently unclear how much the console will cost, although Nintendo indicated it will hit shelves at some point in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers not privy to Nintendo's plans have been waiting on pins and needles for details of what new hardware features its next console might sport. Since the Nintendo Wii, the company has prioritized unique technology like motion sensor controls, second-screens, and portability over graphical and computing power.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a brief announcement video (embedded below), Nintendo showed a device that looks like a larger version of the Switch with a few added bells and whistles. The Japanese company didn't share concrete tech specs, but we can see the Switch 2 features redesigned Joy-Con controllers that click onto the side of the console (rather than slide), a new-look kickstand and dock, a larger display, and additional ports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with some Switch titles, but noted certain games "may not be supported or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Software announcements were also missing from today's reveal, although we did see the Switch 2 running a tantalisingly unfamiliar version of Mario Kart in both docked and handheld mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company has promised to share more details about the console at a later date.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ?si=jxaRiUUkZ9coS-XV" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speculation about the Nintendo Switch successor ran rampant over the last year, as developers, executives, and internet detectives with strong sleuthing skills tried to peel back how the company could top the surprise reveal of a portable console with detachable controllers in 2016.

Perhaps, after that, is when Switch 2 will actually launch?

            <p>After months of waiting and numerous social media posts about Donkey Kong, Nintendo has finally unveiled its highly-anticipated Switch successor, now officially known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Let's-a-go!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 was revealed this afternoon with a video giving us a brief look at its new design. This includes those magnetic Joy Cons and what looks like the previously rumoured mouse functionality. </p>
<p>The console is due out in 2025, with more news coming at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo Direct on 2nd April</a>. You can check the Switch 2 announcement below.</p>

<p>As well as giving us a look at the new hardware, Nintendo also gave us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">peep at a new Mario Kart game</a>. This snippet showed Nintendo regulars like Mario (or course), Peach, Luigi and Bowser - to name just a handful - making their way on a number of karts and bikes. Alas, nothing on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> just yet. </p><p>
Nintendo said the Switch 2 will play exclusive games for the console, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games. It did note, however, certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or "fully compatible" with Switch 2.</p>

<p>If you are keen to give the console a go for yourself before its release (which remains TBA away from that aforementioned 2025 window), the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">company will also hold Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events</a>. 
</p>
<p>For those in the UK, this event will be held in London between 11th and 13th April.</p>
<p>"Tickets will be made available through a free-to-enter, randomly selected draw. Enter the draw anytime during the registration period for a chance to attend," reads the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Campaigns/Nintendo-Switch-2-Experience-London-2722997.html">official line from Nintendo</a>. "Registrations for the London event are open from January 17th at 14:00 (UK time) until January 26th at 23:59 (UK time).</p>
<p>"A free Nintendo Account is required to register. It is only possible to register for one event across Europe."</p>

<p>Today's announcement comes months, nay years, since reports about Nintendo's next console first started making the rounds.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">Eurogamer got word the system's capabilities had been demoed to developers around Gamescom</a>. In the time that followed, there were numerous further leaks regarding the Switch 2's overall design and functionality - A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell along with internal components</a> popped up online, chatter about its optical sensor made the rounds, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards were found</a>, and that's not even all of them.</p><p>This was all happening without Nintendo itself uttering more than a scant few words about the hardware. In fact, the only thing the company confirmed was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">reveal its Switch successor before the end of March</a> (which it now has), and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">console would be backward compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p>

		<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is a game that stands out for a number of reasons, not least because it shone as one of 2024’s only true exclusive releases for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series consoles</a>. It’s also a spin-off to a beloved film franchise that, instead of being a tie in, treads its own path and narrative through this character’s ongoing adventures.</p>
<p>It’s an undeniable success, with Troy Baker’s turn as Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones proving to be nothing short of remarkable. The story is classic Indy, with a mysterious set of events putting Dr Jones in the direct path of Adolf Hitler’s obsession with the occult, while menacing German archaeologist, Herr Voss chews up the scenery in vicious style.</p>
<p>It’s a game that could easily drag you in from beginning to end, consuming all of your gaming time for a week, but for whatever reason – eating more than my body weight in mince pies at repeated family gatherings being one of them – I’ve not been able to play huge swathes of the game, instead diving in episodically to beat a puzzle, take a few pictures of historic buildings, or indulge in the excellent cutscenes. I’ve been loving it, and if anything this is how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> makes the most sense, with the game mimicking the beats of the very movie serials that inspired Geroge Lucas to create Indy in the first place.</p>

<p>Serials rose to prominence in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, with movies broken down into weekly episodic releases, tempting audiences to return time and time again to the theatre. In a lot of ways, they paved the way for TV series and episodic content that have come to define the way we consume television.</p>

<p>They were often action-packed, with a binary vision of good and evil, making stars of the stalwart heroes and the helpless maidens that they rescued, and each episode came to a close with a cliffhanger designed to bring you back a week later, the hero dangling from a precipice or seemingly destined to die at the hands of a nefarious villain.</p>
<p>These beats exist within Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and, playing it like a serial, they work incredibly well. An early pause comes beneath the Vatican, trapped in a chamber with two potentially deadly routes to navigate. Rather than continue straight through, this was where I left the game, mulling over the fantastical catacombs hidden beneath Rome, and dwelling on what the possible solutions might be.</p>
<p>By the time I returned, I was thoroughly invested in continuing Dr Jones’ adventure. Arguably, even more so than if I’d just hurtled through it as we’re so often keen to do, and particularly as a games writer who plays things to a deadline.</p>

<p>Even just the opening tutorial, a lavishly recreated rendition of the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark, is a perfect serial episode, introducing us to our hero and, in the film, our antagonist. It’s packed full of action and drama, lasts fifteen minutes, and in the movie it ends with Jones’ dramatic escape via seaplane, setting us up for the further adventures we’re about to take part in.</p>
<p>Lucas’ obsession with serial movies stemmed from his childhood, where Saturday-morning matinees revisited the format that was already starting to dwindle in popularity thanks to the rise of television. Here, serials like Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and Zorro cemented his love for swashbuckling heroes, and of science fiction, which he famously had some small success with as well.</p>
<p>If anything, episodic content is the perfect delivery format. The first instances of it can be traced back to the serialised fiction that authors like Charles Dickens and F. Scott Fitzgerald made their name with, releasing a steady stream of serialised chapters in the newspapers of the day. Novellas like A Christmas Carol built their audience organically, gaining popularity, notoriety and success long before water coolers had been invented to talk about them over.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this worked, and continues to work, in terms of distributing content to the masses, but in the case of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle it’s because it gives you time to think. It gives you time to mull over the things you’ve seen, the places you’ve visited, and roll them over in your mind, picking away at the layers of art and storytelling that MachineGames have crafted.</p>

<p>Games have adopted more episodic formats in a variety of ways, though it’s come at a price. Live service games are the most significant example running through the industry right now, their constant need for new activities, more battle passes, higher player engagement metrics leading to a massive churn of creative effort that all too often feels doomed to failure. A better parallel would be the episodic narrative adventures of Telltale Games, though they famously struggled to meet production deadlines, the gaps between episodes being too long and interest waning – thankfully their most recent effort, The Expanse, from the reborn studio had a faster cadence.</p>
<p>And on a more simplistic level, we often see games designed with a more bitesized narrative approach in mind. That’s especially true of games for handhelds like Nintendo Switch or even PC handhelds like Steam Deck, where games that let you pick up and play for 10-20 minutes at a time can mesh better with the free time windows we have for gaming.</p>
<p>While Indiana Jones and The Great Circle doesn’t explicitly stop and start, nor pushes you to do so, the beats of serialised fiction and cinema run through it. I urge you, perhaps for a second playthrough, or if you’re waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">the game’s eventual release on PS5</a>, consider playing it like the serials that inspired the character. Step away at the cliffhanger, leave Indy dangling from a zeppelin, because, just like the artefacts he cherishes, the passage of time changes things, adding value where there wasn’t any before.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wartorn-is-a-fantasy-real-time-tactics-game-with-roguelite-elements-set-for-spring-debut-in-early-access/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wartorn-is-a-fantasy-real-time-tactics-game-with-roguelite-elements-set-for-spring-debut-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Dallas-based game developer Stray Kite Studios announced Wartorn, an upcoming real-time tactics game with roguelite elements. It will be set in a fantasy realm devastated by extremism and the unraveling of ancient bonds and follows two elven sisters as they fight to survive and reunite with their family. Stray Kite promises tough decisions for players, such as deciding who gets fed or which lives can be saved, all while confronting the eternal moral dilemmas of violence and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Paul Hellquist (BioShock, Borderlands 2), Creative Director and Co-founder of Stray Kite Studios, said:</p>
<p><em>Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness. We’ve poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us.</em></p>
<p>Shovaen Patel (Orcs Must Die!), Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Stray Kite Studios, added:</p>
<p><em>Our vision for Wartorn is a game that seamlessly blends artistic expression, tactical depth, and emotional resonance. We want players to feel like every choice matters, both on the battlefield and in the story.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Wartorn - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, we're promised a dynamic combat system that emphasizes taking advantage of elemental forces like fire, water, and lightning. Players may ignite tar to engulf enemies, amplify electric shocks with water, or douse flames if it suits them. The environments are also destructible, ensuring additional layers of depth and unpredictability to the encounters. The roguelite-inspired progression will reward persevering players by offering heirlooms, hero upgrades, and new abilities that can be carried to the next run. There's also a slow-time feature that lets players pause combat and issue precise commands, adapting gameplay to suit their pace.</p>
<p>Visually, Wartorn adopts a peculiar painterly aesthetic that might not be to everyone's liking. We'll see what the reaction is from the public. The game is set to debut this Spring in early access via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>If Nvidia were to be believed, true artificial intelligence is just around the corner, waiting for the chance to kill all the humans and take our jobs. For now, "AI" will have to be content with rendering more reflective puddles in games via DLSS.</p>

<p>DLSS itself is basically a fancy term for "rendering technologies that uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and improve image quality" and has been supported by Nvidia GPUs since the RTX 20 series. The RTX 50 series will be utilizing DLSS 4, which is "backed by an Nvidia AI supercomputer in the cloud constantly improving your PC's gaming capabilities."</p>

<p>Putting aside the marketing buzzword salad, Nvidia's RTX 50 series seems like a great leap forward for GPUs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" rel="nofollow">Digital Foundry's demonstration of the RTX 5080</a> appears to echo this sentiment, showing that at the absolute highest level the RTX 50 series can make a game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run like it was originally advertised.</p>

<p>Therein lies the conundrum with the RTX 50 series though. With a price tag ranging from between $550 to $2,000, this next generation of GPU is likely going to be wildly out of reach for the average gamer, bringing up the question, "Who is this for?"</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: The Best GPUs For A Game That Doesn't Yet Exist</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-specs.jpg?itok=oHsOx03A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-specs.jpg?itok=_uUWFO_H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bigger number equals gooder</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" rel="nofollow">according to Steam's own end-user survey</a>, only about 20% of the participants are using RTX 40 series GPUs. Most are sticking to the 30 series and below, and it's reasonable to assume that lower end hardware is far more prevalent as casual gamers are probably not shelling out hundreds of dollars for a newer GPU. For that matter, it's doubtful that casual players would be particularly inclined to take part in the survey to begin with.</p>

<p>If anything, it seems irresponsible to recommend the RTX 50 series to most people because it is complete overkill for the vast majority of games. Perhaps in 10 years we'll get games that "need" DLSS, but the RTX 20 series and above supports DLSS anyways, so it's kind of a moot point.</p>

<p>A look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers" rel="nofollow">Steam's top sellers list</a> reinforces this notion as it shows that the most popular games are not exactly hardware intensive. As an example, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow">Helldivers 2</a> </em>are both perfectly content with Nvidia's RTX 20 series GPUs. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> recommends a GTX 1070. <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow">Balatro</a> </em>can be run on a toaster.</p>

<p>As you go down the list, <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> status as an outlier becomes more and more apparent, making it simultaneously the best and worst game to use to show what a graphics card is capable of. The average game simply isn't going to need state-of-the-art GPUs to look good, doubly so if it's a decade-old game like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: Do You Guys Not Have Phones?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zzz-ps5-ray-tracing.jpg?itok=A9nL8J-G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zzz-ps5-ray-tracing.jpg?itok=Srx7lEJx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pour one out for all the janitors who died to make sure that golden toilet remained reflective after the apocalypse</figcaption></figure><p>Things look even more dire when you throw in the fact that the mobile gaming market is actually the same size as the combined PC and console gaming market. According to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2023-pc-games-revenue-increase-newzoo/" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278181/global-gaming-market-revenue-device/" rel="nofollow">Statista</a>, the PC gaming market is the smallest of the three by far, making up less than 25% of the overall gaming market revenue in 2023 and 2024. If Nvidia's RTX 50 series is overkill for "normal" PC games, then using it for PC ports of mobile games would be akin to strapping a jet engine onto a bicycle to make the bike go faster.</p>

<p>As an example, Hoyoverse recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqFkJqHj5U" rel="nofollow">added ray tracing to <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> exclusively to the PS5</a>. It's an improvement to be sure, but you kind of have to know what to look for to notice it, and most people probably aren't going to notice it when in combat. Besides, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow">ZZZ's</a> </em>good looks hinges more on its art style than any particular graphical setting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Nvidia's marketing department, they want you to associate ray tracing exclusively with their RTX GPUs. Yet if it's not noticeable in normal gameplay, or if enabling it causes performance issues, then you're not exactly losing out by buying an equally priced console that can also run ray tracing.</p>

<p>This brings up another issue with such blisteringly high-end GPUs as the Nvidia RTX 50 series. Game developers themselves should and will rightfully target the lowest practical common denominator when it comes to hardware. Otherwise it becomes a never-ending arms race where developers would have to spend more resources for better graphics that only an increasingly smaller percentage of the audience will enjoy.</p>

<p>You can see this play out in real time when it comes to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow">Skyrim</a> </em>on the PC. It's generally a good idea to download some enhanced texture mods for <em>Skyrim </em>so that the game looks somewhat up to date, but it has to be done in moderation. After all, there's no point in downloading a 4K texture pack if it causes you to drop to 10 FPS every time you look at a cloud.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: The Power of Marketing, Brand Recognition, and Hopes and Dreams</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-rtx.jpg?itok=w67qLJcm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-rtx-50-series-rtx.jpg?itok=b1YrKoRc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"RTX on!" cried the magician, and thus the game became playable</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, DLSS and RTX aren't magic, contrary to what Nvidia wants you to believe. Old games aren't going to look like modern games at the press of a button because no GPU in the existence is going to change a game's texture files. A human being has to manually make new textures then apply those textures to the game, a fact that is always conveniently left out of the "RTX On" marketing materials.</p>

<p>That being said, while Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs are complete overkill now, who knows what the future of gaming might look like in 10 or 20 years. It wasn't that long ago that 30 FPS was the norm. Nowadays if a modern game is hitting 30 FPS, people act like the game should go straight to the dumpster.</p>

<p>Ray tracing itself certainly isn't going anywhere. It's another tool for developers to use, if they feel that it is necessary to use it. A painter doesn't need to use every brush available to them for the brushes to be imbued with value.</p>

<p>The future of "AI" assisted rendering is less clear. The use of "AI" in creative fields rightfully leaves a bad taste in people's mouths, to say nothing of practical performance.<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> might look fine while walking around at a leisurely pace, but at the end of the day if the game starts stuttering when the shooting starts and you have particles and visual effects flying everywhere, people will bump down their graphics settings.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's RTX 50 Series: Who's the Real Customer?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-ces-keynote-ai_0.jpg?itok=EtutvtD1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-ces-keynote-ai_0.jpg?itok=V45imSpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>200,000 units are ready, with a million more well on the way</figcaption></figure><p>Make no mistake, Nvidia's RTX 50 series GPU look like they're great pieces of hardware. Upgrading to a RTX 5070 doesn't seem that unreasonable if (and only if) you're several generations behind or you don't particularly care about what the GPU is actually doing under the hood. At the same time, one should keep in mind that the RTX 50 series is essentially a solution looking for a problem to solve as of now, especially when there's no shortage of alternatives.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is that Nvidia wasn't necessarily marketing the RTX 50 series to the average gamer. Like it or not, Nvidia is setting their sights on something bigger than the gaming industry and the proof is in their own CES keynote.</p>

<p>Besides, who said that Nvidia can only sell GPUs to gamers? Hollywood, NASA, the United States Department of Defense, there's a long list of potential customers with pockets far deeper than those of gamers. As far as their shareholders are likely concerned, Nvidia doesn't even need to sell a single 50 series GPU so long as the line on Wall Street keeps going up. That's the real audience for Nvidia's RTX 50 series, and the concerns of your average gamer are barely an afterthought by comparison.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals devs have warned keyboard and mouse adapter users that they will be banned from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on their website, Marvel Rivals devs addressed the community’s queries about keyboard and mouse adapters. They said they would “relentlessly” battle cheating and call on the community to help maintain a positive gaming atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, keyboard and mouse adapters allow players to mimic controller inputs while using a keyboard and mouse. This behaviour gives cheaters an unfair competitive advantage over players using controllers, as the cheater also benefits from the aim-assist features for the console version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals devs have also released a list of keyboard and mouse adapters, including the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series. They added that any other device that emulates controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse would also be considered an adapter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To combat keyboard and mouse adapter users on Marvel Rivals, the devs have created a “strong detection tool” that, along with their “watchful human eyes, accurately identifies those using keyboard and mouse adapters. They will take steps “to vanquish this nefarious behaviour”, regardless of whether you’re on a PC or a console. Players who use these adapters to cheat could be subjected to temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spiderman-suit-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Spider-Man suits</a> is coming to Marvel Rivals later this month. Also, the game director recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their plans for esports</a>.

<p>In a new statement, the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 developers revealed that they are already looking for the next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the statement about the new Warhammer game comes from their latest <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial results</a>. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Roundtree first acknowledged the success of Space Marine 2, stating that they “recognise the success of these recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games”. Roundtree added that they are clearly “looking for the next one” and are remaining “cautious when forecasting royalty income”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about Space Marine 2’s success, the licensing revenue section of the financial statement revealed that earned income was £26.1 million (approximately USD 32 million), and the increase was “mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. 98% of the total licensing revenue for Games Workshop was contributed by PC and Console game, which was also thanks to Space Marine 2’s release on the platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of a new Warhammer Space Marine 2 game, the game director had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-devs-already-have-ideas-for-a-major-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously stated</a> they had already “proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel”.

<p>Treyarch is shocking everyone in Season 2 by adding The Tomb Black Ops 6 Zombies map. It takes BLOPS 6 up to four Zombies maps, and The Tomb’s release date promises new weapons, Easter Eggs, and much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> isn’t standing around on undead ceremony. Developer Treyarch is making up for disappointing years between Black Ops Cold War and BLOPS 6 by announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-revealed-launches-january-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Zombies map</a>—already the fourth, only three months removed from launch. It is set to sit alongside Liberty Falls, Terminus, and Citadelle des Morts, and give you a selection headache.</p>



<p>More content isn’t a bad thing by any means! It’s even more exciting as Treyarch has hinted at big new incomings from Easter Eggs to a legendary weapon making a comeback.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tomb-zombies-map-release-date-in-black-ops-6">The Tomb Zombies Map Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>

<p><strong>The Tomb’s release date is January 28—alongside Black Ops 6 Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>Season 1 Reloaded has been fun, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> is shaping up to be a good one. The Tomb is a day-one drop, and you can tell Treyarch is already excited about it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD Zombies blog</a> about Day 115, the team said, “We’ve crafted The Tomb to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls (by far our most-played Zombies map in recent years!), featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-new-easter-eggs-for-the-tomb-zombies-in-black-ops-6">New Easter Eggs For The Tomb Zombies in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A whole new world to explore. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Treyarch has said it’s “delivering plenty of side Easter Eggs” in Black Ops 6 Zombies’ The Tomb map.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen music Easter Eggs for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a>. Each map has featured a plethora of smaller Easter Eggs to go alongside Main Quest objectives too. Even though we don’t know any of the new Easter Eggs, you can likely expect another triple-set of headphones to find, hidden armaments and goodies, and a fully fledged story Easter Egg to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-wonder-weapon-remake-for-the-tomb-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Wonder Weapon Remake for The Tomb in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p><strong>A “reimagined Wonder Weapon” is being teased for The Tomb in Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>The Tomb currently has four <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a> to use: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>, Thrustodyne M23 (AKA Jet Gun), DRI-11 Beamsmasher, and Bastard Swords. A returning weapon from Treyarch’s past narrows it down, but it could still be one of many Wonder Weapons: The DIE Shockwave from Black Ops Cold War, the Void Bow from Black Ops 3, or Alistair’s Annihilator from Black Ops 4.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed it’s a good one I can use to relive nostalgia and turn Zombies into inedible soup.</p>



<h2 id="h-iconic-weapon-returns-in-black-ops-6-the-tomb-map">Iconic Weapon Returns in Black Ops 6 The Tomb Map</h2>



<p><strong>Another promised Black Ops 6 surprise is “one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride” in The Tomb Zombies map.</strong></p>



<p>I don’t know if this ties into one of Season 2’s new guns in general. Either way, it could be an MP-40, PPSH, or M1927 Thompson—all speculation. Treyarch knows how to keep the community entertained and bring back fan-favorite gear. Here’s hoping the announcement lives up to the hype.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you shocked to see The Tomb announced so soon after Citadelle des Morts? How many more Zombies maps do you think Treyarch adds before all is said and done in Black Ops 6 Zombies?</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has discussed why the company's PS Vita handheld didn't sell well, stating Sony didn't have the resources to split between two platforms but originally it had similar capabilities to Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<p>Since its release in 2011, the Vita handheld is estimated to have sold 10-15m units - that's far less than the 80m of its predecessor, the PSP, and less than either the Wii U or the GameCube.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Yoshida suggested why he felt Vita sales under-performed.</p>

<p>"There are multiple reasons why Vita didn't work," he said. "It worked in a way that people loved playing games, especially indie games, on PS Vita. It was lovely hardware."</p>
<p>"Several technical choices we as a company made weren't really good ones," he continued. "One of which was the proprietary memory cards. That was a mistake, people had to spend more money to get the memory cards."</p>
<p>Further, he admitted the back touch "was not necessary". "Sometimes the team made amazing prototypes that felt so good and that misled everyone involved," he said, noting it added cost to the hardware. Similarly the OLED screen increased the production cost of each unit.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Vita dev kit had a video output to allow the handheld to connect to screens, but this was removed for the consumer release.</p>
<p>"It was really a bad idea," Yoshida joked, in a nod to the Switch's capabilities. "The development team removed that feature just to save a few cents of cost."</p>
<p>Yoshida then concluded: "I think the biggest reason Vita didn't do as well as we had hoped was that we had to spread all of our efforts/resources into two different platforms. And we didn't have that resource."</p>
<p>He added Sony didn't have a big enough talent pool across its studios to support both its home consoles (PS3 and PS4) as well as the handheld Vita. And as the consoles were more popular, they were prioritised.</p>
<p>This, Yoshida believes, is why Nintendo has been successful, as the rival company has pooled its resources into a single platform with dual capabilities. He even joked the Switch is the Vita 2.</p>
<p>Still, PlayStation's legacy, said Yoshida, is providing cutting edge technology at affordable prices, so there was never a discussion of combining efforts into a single piece of hardware as Nintendo did.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the same interview, Yoshida also touched on Sony's live-service game aspirations and said he likely would've resisted the move towards live-service games had he been in Hermen Hulst's position as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>"For me, I was managing this annual budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make," said Yoshida. "If the company was considering [a focus on live-service games], it probably didn't make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into these service games.</p><p>"However, what they did after I moved on and Hermen [Hulst] took over is Sony added a lot more resources. I don't think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. They said 'these games are great, just continue doing that, and we'll give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it'."</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm sure they knew it's risky. The chance of a game being successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that’s the way they did it. In my mind, that’s great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p>
<p>"I'm lucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> did so well!" he joked, adding: "You cannot plan for success in this industry, that's the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end.</p>
<p>"If I was in the position of Hermen, probably I would've tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party, because they knew I wouldn't do it!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation earlier this week</a> after over 30 years working for the company, including as boss of PlayStation Worldwide Studios between 2008 and 2019.</p>

The Switch eShop is slow, outdated, stuffed with shovelware and needs a drastic overhaul in time for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. But if you don't want to wait, there's good news today! 
</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal</a>? What Switch 2 reveal. No, we're talking about the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/eshop">Better eShop</a>, a fan-made project built by website Nintendo Life.
</p>
<p>
This browser-based eShop offers a super-quick interface that plugs into Nintendo's store back-end. It's a much faster way to browse, filters out the hentai, and allows users to still buy games directly from Nintendo.

<p>
Several fan-requested eShop features have been built in as standard, including the ability to read or submit user reviews, and create customisable game search filters. 
</p>
<p>
Filters enabled by default mean you won't see 6247 games that have already been selected as "low quality, low effort or other kinds of spam", five titles listed as "asset flips" and 156 titles "based around hentai".
</p>
<p>
Other cool features include a dark mode, and the ability to toggle on the iconic Wii Shop Channel music. It truly is update day!
</p>
<p>
Upcoming features include Wishlist functionality, screenshots, additional regions (Better eShop currently supports the UK, US and EU) and the ability to mute specific game publishers.
</p>
<p>
"Better eShop was built in less than a week," the site states. "It's quite possible that Nintendo will start blocking us from gathering the data - but until then, we will continue to build and improve the Better eShop."

			<p>Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida was featured in a lengthy video chat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Greg Miller of Kinda Funny Games</a>. Yoshida worked for over thirty years at Sony's PlayStation division, holding positions such as Vice President of Sony Computer Entertainment America, President of Sony Worldwide Studios, and later Head of the Independent Developer Initiative.</p>
<p>His tenure <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially ended yesterday</a> and that's also when the interview went live, diving into the executive's whole career. However, the most interesting part was discussing <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shuhei-yoshida-replaced-hermen-hulst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his replacement with Herman Hulst</a> as the head of the internal first-party studio organization. Shortly afterward, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed heavily into live service games</a> after many successful single player releases.</p>
<p>When asked if the new business strategy made sense to him, Yoshida replied that the resources were additive rather than replacing investments in single player. However, he also admitted he might have resisted that change in direction, and jokingly added that may have been why he was replaced.</p>
<p><em>I was managing this annual budget and was responsible to allocate resources to what kind of games to make. If the company was considering that way, it probably wouldn't have made sense to stop making another God of War or whatever, like a great single player game, and put all the money into these service games. However, what they did after I moved on and Herman Hulst took over is that they added a lot more resources. I don't think they told him to stop making these single player games. They said, oh yeah, these games are great. Continue doing that, and we give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I'm sure they knew it was risky and that the chance of a successful game in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company knowing that risk gave Herman the resources and the chance to try it. I think that's the way they did it, so in my mind I was, oh wow, that's great and hopefully some games will become successful. Luckily, Helldivers 2 did so well. No one would have expected it. You cannot plan a success in this industry, that's the most fun part</em>.</p>
<p><em>I thought if I was in the position of Herman, I would have tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me (laughs).</em></p>
<p>It was definitely a risky move for Sony with more than a few missteps, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Online</a> (canceled after Naughty Dog decided it wouldn't want to become a live service studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a> (shut down just a few days after launch with the subsequent closure of the studio). As Yoshida said, luckily there was one success, albeit the least anticipated among the bunch, with Arrowhead's Helldivers 2, which became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest-selling PlayStation title ever</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least another major tidbit that's worth reporting from the interview: the executive's take on the whole Bloodborne situation. Fans have been clamoring to get a sequel or at least a remaster for years, but Sony and FromSoftware appear deaf to those cries. Here's what Yoshida believes is the main obstacle:</p>
<p><em>I have only my personal theory on that situation. I left first party, so I don't know what's going on but my theory is... I remember Miyazaki really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. I think he is interested, but he's so successful and so busy that he cannot do it himself, but he doesn't want anyone else to touch it. That's my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish. That's my guess.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, if Miyazaki is busy with an Elden Ring sequel, he certainly doesn't have time to work on Bloodborne 2. However, Sony has recently become the largest shareholder of FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Corporation. They might have more sway in choosing his next big project.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-expected-to-announce-a-new-game-this-year-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1083729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/halo-new-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios is seemingly gearing up to announce a new Halo game this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/524254/article/halo-will-have-a-new-game-announcement-this-year-says-industry-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1879364933630251302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a> recently spoke about the imminent announcement of an upcoming Halo game. His tweet revealed that the studio has been playtesting future games for the franchise “on a weekly basis”. Rebs Gaming added, “Since they are this far in development, I expect at least one new Halo game announcement this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details about this unannounced Halo game come from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvbaB-n8cro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> video Rebs Gaming posted earlier this week, in which he discussed the new Halo Studios Playtest Lab. This new initiative was revealed through a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xbox_how-do-you-create-the-best-possible-game-activity-7282199996127453185-lYFF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post about a “centralised testing space” that can host staff from different departments so they can playtest games together, share ideas, and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebs Gaming also mentioned another hint about the unannounced Halo game in the same post. The Support, Safety, and Playtest Manager, Susan Bunch, stated that the teams have hosted “a playtest session for the artists and designers to come in and play similar maps in production.” Based on this, the insider speculates that we might receive a reveal pretty soon if maps for the upcoming Halo title are already in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, last month’s massive Halo leak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed dev builds, unreleased content, and more details</a>. Also, OpTic Gaming has assembled a Halo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“super squad” for 2025</a>. What are your thoughts on a new Halo game being announced this year?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The recent deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> details will have left Nintendo "really mad" and prompted time-consuming investigations into where information has leaked from.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, who worked at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> for more than a decade and experienced the company's processes when leaks erupted previously.
</p>
<p>
"This really does have a disruptive impact in what the company's trying to do now, which is to announce and launch a new console - which is hard enough as it is," Yang said on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRh5csh7mI&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta</a> podcast.

</figure>
<p>
"[Nintendo]'s been disrupted daily, for months, with these leaks, and I'm 100 percent sure they are really mad, to the most severe level. We joke around but... they are very, very, very upset by this."
</p>
<p>
While leaks of information from Nintendo's manufacturing supply chain - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance">such as the Switch 2 motherboard</a> - may be dealt with overseas, the duo discussed information they felt may have trickled out from within Nintendo itself, from the team working on the Switch 2 launch. And when this sort of leak happens, Nintendo always investigates internally.
</p>
<p>
"They do have very good people that investigate these things," Ellis said. "They will eventually get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and it takes a lot of just talking to everybody involved. 
</p>
<p>
"This is hard work, this is a lot of work and the people working on this - and it's not the whole company, it's a small group of people, at this point, who are allowed to know this information - need to focus all of their efforts onto [Switch 2].
</p><p>
"But now... half of their day is going to be eaten up by [questions like] 'I have to talk to you about every step you have taken at this point, who have you talked to, where do you think this could have happened?' And, quite frankly, that's time they don't have."
</p>
<p>
Yang said the pair had been through similar processes during their time at the company, and that teams "basically have another full-time job of being part of the investigation into these leaks". 
</p>
<p>
"It's extremely disruptive, it's a high-stress situation as well because you really feel like you're in the hot seat," Yang concluded.
</p>
<p>
Leaks also limit Nintendo's desire to grow the teams working on under-wraps products, Ellis added, so as to avoid leaks spreading further. This then meant more work, as product launches neared, on a smaller circle of people.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 has been widely-tipped for an imminent reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">reports the console could be unveiled later today</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The expectation is that Nintendo will first show off its long-awaited Switch 2 successor via a brief introductory video focused on the console hardware itself, before a longer look at a later date showcasing Switch 2 games.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-2-monster-hunter-wilds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-2-monster-hunter-wilds.1083717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-2-monster-hunter-wilds/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems insane to me that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is sitting second in our Most Wanted rundown. Not because it’s going to be bad – I’m fairly certain it will be the best Monster Hunter game since the last one – but because for years and years, Monster Hunter was this weird, niche co-op series that was huge in Japan and played by a minimal number of weirdos (like me) everywhere else. Monster Hunter is now Capcom’s biggest franchise, and it’s fair to say that the hype surrounding Monster Hunter Wilds is so big, it probably had something to do with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-20th-march-2025/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows moving its release date back yet again</a>. That’s right — Assassin’s Creed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 5th Trailer | The Black Flame" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahy0AO8WwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was an epic sojourn back into Nintendo-centric Monster Hunter games, it was technically limited by arriving natively for the Nintendo Switch. Monster Hunter Wilds though is fundamentally a direct successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-world-iceborne">Monster Hunter World</a> – an incredible, era-defining action RPG that I awarded a rare <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review/">10/10 to back in the day</a>. Add in the benefit of this console generation, with the game set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC all at once, and we’re already lined up for what will be the most technically advanced Monster Hunter ever.</p>


<p>That’s not to say that some of the advancements from Monster Hunter Rise have been forgotten. While we can bid farewell to the flashy Wirebug moves – I don’t know how long it’s going to take me not to try and airdash out of trouble in Monster Hunter Wilds – we are getting an all-new mount to speed us around the open world of Wilds. This time out, rather than those good-boy Palamutes, we’re all going to be riding massive feathered creatures known as Seikrets, who, alongside running really fast, can also glide slowly down from great heights.</p>


<p>It feels as though they’re going to help open up the world, which, rather than being broken down into separate stages, will have different hunting areas to explore. It’s an expansion of the idea we saw in the Guiding Lands of Monster Hunter World’s endgame, where the traditional different landscapes of Monster Hunter were all mashed together, though here in Wilds it’s going to be on a scale the series has never seen before. The dev team aren’t totally labelling it as an ‘open-world’ but equally, they’re not shying away from that tag either. You can expect it to be big.</p>
<p>It needs to be big too, when it’s going to be stuffed with huge monsters for you to take down. If you’ve never played a Monster Hunter game, the loop goes like this: find your target monster, attack them, chase them down, try not to die, capture or kill them, carve off pieces from the carcass, use those pieces to make better weapons and armour, find a bigger monster, repeat. Any story the series has ever had generally stands as an excuse for you to do this over and over again, and, as someone who’s been doing it for twenty years, it’s a loop that doesn’t get old.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will also continue the series tradition of being better with friends, and you can form a party with three other Hunters to take down Monsters in an even more efficient way. Then again, they scale in difficulty and health with more Hunters, so you might just as easily be making things more difficult. There’s nothing better though than working together to bring a monster to its knees, coordinating attacks, focussing on specific limbs or wounds, or laying traps for you all to lead it into. For the first time in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds is going to be cross-play, meaning you can hook up with fellow Hunters across whatever platform they’re playing on. This alone is an epic improvement. If only we could get cross-save too, and then I’d be utterly content.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to be one of the biggest games of the year, and it’s also nearly within reach as it’s set to launch on 28th February for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

A remaster (Sony loves a remaster)? A sequel? A next-gen update? Fans of FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece have begged for more ever since the game launched to critical and commercial acclaim a decade ago. So, what gives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from the reveal of his first voice acting gig following his exit from Sony, PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory. And we must be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Kinda Funny Games</a> he stressed is not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack Shuhei’s comment here. Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">it’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, then 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> for Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Shuhei is touching on here is a potential desire from Miyazaki to do something with Bloodborne, but he doesn’t want anyone else to do it. And Sony, Shuhei suggests, respects that wish, despite owning the intellectual property. Certainly Miyazaki has earned that respect and the ability to pick and choose his projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Sony, some Bloodborne fans feel a tad… trolled by PlayStation. For example, last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-freak-out-again-as-playstation-anniversary-trailer-ends-on-bloodborne-and-the-phrase-its-about-persistence">Bloodborne fans freaked out over a potential announcement</a> after Sony ended its special PlayStation 30th Anniversary trailer with a clip from the beloved FromSoftware game and the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, given Shuhei’s theory, fans will need plenty of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
