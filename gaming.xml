            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-creator-no-paid-dlc-ever<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>creator Eric Barone, otherwise known as ConcernedApe, has made a very strong pledge regarding the inclusion of paid updates or DLC in his games.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">provided an update</a> regarding the work he's doing on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, promising that "the ports and next PC update are still in progress" and that he'll announce when "there is any meaningful news".</p>
<p>A user <a href="https://x.com/Hikuzu56/status/1815276225474285830" rel="noopener" target="_blank">responded to Barone</a> by saying that as long as everything added to the game is "completely free", people won't complain about waiting, which is when Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815278461269000401" rel="noopener" target="_blank">made his solemn pledge</a>: that he will "never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=n5I2IhI- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=K_CjnEsG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never pay a cent for&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>DLC, on ConcernedApe's "family name".</figcaption></figure><p>Barone says he swears "on the honor of [his] family name" that he'll never make players pay for an update or a DLC pack, and he doesn't specify that he means&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>alone, so that presumably applies to all of his games.</p>
<p>He says that fellow X users should "screencap this and shame [him]" if he ever goes back on his word, so feel free to do that, although I'm sure that Barone is sincere, so you probably won't need to use it as leverage.</p>
<p>This does mean, however, that when (or perhaps that should be "if")&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape">Haunted Chocolatier</a>&nbsp;</em>ever sees the light of day, you won't have to pay anything for its DLC either. Chalk that up as a win for indie development, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=Dh-FHofz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=bwukYe8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>is still in the works, or at least I assume so.</figcaption></figure><p>For now, though, it looks like Barone is focused on bringing the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-16-update-released-with-intimidatingly-large-patch-notes-breaking">1.6 update</a> to consoles and mobile devices. Porting the update to these platforms requires "extra work" over and above what the PC version needs, according to Barone.</p>
<p>We may be a ways away from&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, but for now, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>on...well, <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty much everything</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Though it’s possible to do so, Pals who drop Carbon Fiber prove relatively rare, which makes farming a moot point. Instead, <strong>you’ll have better results by crafting Carbon Fiber.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-recommend-id="image://79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-recommend-id="image://79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First and foremost, you must <strong>unlock Carbon Fiber in the technology tree at level 35 for two Technology Points</strong>.

You’ll need either two or five coals. You can craft charcoal in any furnace, but coal only comes from coal rocks commonly found in desert regions.</p><h2 id="h424676"><a id="drop"></a>Which Pals drop Carbon Fiber?</h2><p>Currently, only two Pals in the game drop Carbon Fiber as monster loot: Jetragon and Shadowbeak.

She’ll be released as part of the season 4 pass sometime in 2025. The season 4 pass will also include returning <em>Guilty Gear</em> characters Queen Dizzy, Venom, and new character, Unika.</p></div><div><p>The Warner Bros. platform fighter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599"><em>MultiVersus</em></a></span>, is getting two new fighters in season 2. First up is cartoon legend, Samurai Jack, who will join the roster when season 2 launches on July 23. Beetlejuice will also become a playable fighter later in the season, and while no specific date was given, you can bet it’ll probably be around the September 6 release of movie sequel <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.</p></div><div><p>Despite being “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCF4_xqmxo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCF4_xqmxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completely dead</a></span>” after getting thrown into a volcano in <em>Tekken 7</em>, Heihachi Mishima will be a new fighter in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>. The reveal trailer really played up the return, even flashing through the character’s history throughout the series. I’m sure confused fans will be eager to learn what explanation the game has for this miraculous return. Heihachi will release as part of the first season pass for <em>Tekken 8</em>, alongside other returning fighters Lidia Sobieska and Eddy Gordo. There is currently no release date for the first season.</p></div><div><p>The <em>League of Legends</em> developer’s fighting game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a></span>, had a substantial presence at this year’s Evo.

From this we learned that the launch version of <em>2XKO</em> will be pretty lean, with more game modes being added post-launch. Monetization will be a big part of the free-to-play title, but the team says all characters on the roster will be possible to acquire without spending money. On the topic of characters, it was confirmed at Evo that Katarina will not be part of the launch roster, and that fan-favorite Jinx will be part of the game, but the team wants to take more time before showing her off to the public.</p></div><div><p>The 2003 entry in the crossover fighting series is back. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-svc-chaos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-svc-chaos"><em>SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</em></a></span><em> </em>was announced during the tournament as a shadow release, now available on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span>. The game will also be coming to Nintendo Switch and PS4 on July 22. <em>SVC Chaos</em> brings together a massive roster of fighters from games like <em>Mega Man</em>, <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Darkstalkers</em>, and others.

This coincides with a big 1.50 update that will include new story episodes, a new stage, and a new mode called Grand Bruise about which the trailer didn’t go into detail. She’ll join a roster that is now over 30 fighters long, and includes <em>NieR: Automata</em>’s 2B.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has granted permission to call for an immediate strike against game studios and publishers over protections against AI-generated content.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">union’s official website on Saturday</a>, the union’s Chief Negotiator and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland now has the power to call for a strike at any point should studios not work with them on the aforementioned protections.</p>



<p>This news comes nearly a year after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-gaming-industry-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike was first authorized</a> over these concerns.</p>



<p>“If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA,” the union said.</p>



<p>They continued by saying that parties remain in negotiations. However, they are still “far apart” on conditions covering AI protections.</p>



<p>“Our resolve is unwavering and should not be tested,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “Our membership voted more than 98% yes to authorize a strike of this contract should the employers not come to the table with a deal that includes our critical provisions — especially in A.I. </p>



<p>“We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world’s most popular video games. Time is running out for the companies to make a deal.”</p>



<p>As far as dealing with the rise of AI in video game creation, Crabtree-Ireland said that the union remains determined to work with “ethical AI companies”. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/digital-extremes-answers-all-of-our-soulframe-questions-including-warframe-tie-ins-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-is-the-next-game-from-warframes-digital-extremes-and-its-inspired-by-princess-mononoke"><u>Soulframe</u></a>, an over-the-shoulder fantasy MMO, is the latest game from Warframe developer Digital Extremes. With slick action, otherworldly customization options, and thick lore, Soulframe is undeniably a Warframe sister project, but it's also something completely different. Where the 2013 sci-fi game leans into industrial settings and breakneck action, Soulframe takes a more methodical approach with an emphasis on nature, ancestry, and slower combat.</p><p>IGN attended a press presentation ahead of TennoCon and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-reappears-with-story-gameplay-plans-to-come-to-more-players-this-fall"><u>the inaugural Soulframe dev stream</u></a> to get a better look at the studio’s plans. During an open Q&amp;A session, the team explained that Soulframe’s starting island is about twice as big as Warframe’s first open-world area, The Plains of Eidolon. The studio also promised that Soulframe will feature a Mastery Rank system not unlike Warframe’s, adding that it shares some similarities with the Operator Focus School system. While <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TennoCon 2024</u></a> offered a peak behind the Soulframe curtain, we had to know more.</p><p>We caught up with Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, Creative Director Geoff Crookes, and Community Manager Sarah Asselin to learn more about how Soulframe will evolve over the coming years. Our chat revealed more information about potential Warframe crossover content, how Digital Extremes plans to maintain its community-driven approach to game development, and so much more. There's a lot of work to do, but the team is ready to prove that it's making something a lot more than just Warframe with a palette swap.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: Tell me about your work on Soulframe and how the idea for the game started.</strong></p><p><strong>Steve Sinclair:</strong> We wanted to make a very confusing game, so we called it Soulsframe. Then we realized it should be Eldenframe, which would be less confusing.</p><p><strong>Dark Eldenframe Souls.</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Dark Eldenframe of the Wild [laughs]. This idea had been brewing for a while. We had, I don't know, two or three people working on it for, like, a year in the shadows. Maybe more than that?</p><p><strong>Geoff Crookes:</strong> Yeah, about a year. It was tough because Steve and I still very much loved Warframe and working on it. This absolutely didn't come about from attrition. There was still a lot of excitement we had for where Warframe was going. Maybe we're even all jealous of where it's going now, but you know, the studio was at a point where we have great retention at the company, it's a great studio to work for, and we had a lot of senior people, and it just seemed like a good opportunity to try this. To try to grow the company with another game. That being said, Steve and I are very cautious people, and we're still very insecure in a lot of ways too. I think, Steve, you might have been cooking the fantasy twist first. I think you presented that.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I had to convince you.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You did.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Because it's a very full genre. It's kind of one of the fullest ever, right? So, trying to squeeze out a little space in there, my pitch was like, 'I don't think there's a lot happening in the way Warframe evolves and changes and updates and is community-focused as much in the RPG space.' Obviously, MMOs are a huge angle of that, but the action RPG stuff tends to be in the domain of Path of Exile or Diablo, and that different perspective. I was a Dragon's Dogma fan, and I was like, 'I wonder what a Warframe, co-op-y approach to that world would look like.' I think blending in the Miyazaki stuff was where you wanted to go, Geoff, and the themes of nature and restoration, and the importance of ancestral connections, and the value of the elderly in societies that we don't have in modernity. So, once I started cooking better themes to present to Geoff, then he was like, 'Oh, OK, I do like this.'</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> With how we worked on Warframe, we try to find hooks that excite us. That's what I was looking for when we started talking about this. I think it was when we hit that idea of ancestry and even just how that could form into a multiplayer cooperative game, and how ancestry can be important to players you meet, and how that can affect the game and have some kind of influence, things started to get exciting for us there. Thematically, like we were saying, we were talking about the same things. I know we might not look like it, but we're around the same age, Steve and I, so we share a lot of inspirations from when we were younger. We started talking about the retro influences we have, and I hope you see a bit of that in how the world is presented. You know, some of those old '80s fantasy movies and whatnot. The more we talked about that the more bought-in we got, the more excited we got, and then we worked with longtime collaborator Keith Thompson. We quick call pitched him this idea, he whipped up some drawings, and then we were sold. He sent us some ideas of the Envoy and established the conflict we were talking about in the world and we were like, 'Let's do this,' and we committed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Official Cinematic Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>Warframe celebrated its 10-year anniversary last year. After so much time spent in building that game with the help of its community, what lessons that the team learned from that approach, and how is that knowledge being applied to Soulframe?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Everything. Steve, feel free to jump in too, but I would say how we started was a big impact. I think a lot of studios would have just doubled the studio scope and gone silent for two to three years to make something. I think it is a factor of our insecurity, where we're like, 'Warframe's development worked for us.' That progressive formation of this identity that we grew with the community. We learned how important that community involvement was to the identity of the game as it grew. So, I think the question we asked each other was, 'Can you still do that in this day and age? We don't know, but we think so, so let's try.' It's what we know. I think that's how we started it, right, Steve?</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> And we kind of stumbled, didn't we?</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>[Laughs] We sure did. We couldn't break our current habits of Warframe. You're right.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We stumbled because we started taking longer between releases, and going dark for longer. Then we just kind of woke up and were like, 'OK, holy shit. We gotta release something every month and act on what people are enjoying and give them more of that and less of the things that aren't working.' Speed is a big part of it. I'm not sure what you would say, Sarah, about how the community stuff is working.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Of course, it all begins with our community. That is why it's possible.</p></div><p><strong>Sarah Asselin:</strong> Of course, it all begins with our community. That is why it's possible. It's our community that, I feel, is giving us the chance to build something new, and with Soulframe Preludes, which is what people are currently playing in, it's a chance to build that beside them. It's been really cool seeing everyone's feedback on these really early days, and being like, 'OK, a lot of people miss Tuvalkane,' which I heard they still are. So after TennoCon, that's my priority number one.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I guess some of the things that we would do differently... We're sharing technology, we're sharing the back-end servers, we're trying to make it so that, the way the game is built, generally, you could move between the two teams within DE, and that's been happening. So that's been good. That's like a Dobis business nonsense answer, but when we started and took it seriously, Geoff, I remember we drew a line and we wrote Warframe on this side, and we said 'Fast, industrial, bleak, apocalyptic, sci-fi, glow-y, cynical,' right? And then on [the other side], we just kind of wrote the opposites of those: slower, natural, romantic, optimistic, no celebration of gore, and stuff like that. I mean, we did add a little bit more gore last month, but that's more about the game design and not about chasing the nastiness. So yeah, we did have a mirror and did a reflection of Warframe so that we wouldn't be just repeating ourselves. We still seem to make mistakes or forget those lessons. On my side, I contributed a lot to the early design of Warframe, and some of those regrets kind of surrounding complexity, and things like that. So, trying to make a simpler kind of game. Sure, it's gonna have upgrades and all that stuff, but can we boil it down to its most simple essence? I love the modding in Warframe – I made it. I mean, other people have obviously run with it, but some of those things we're just trying to do differently and just keep ourselves on our toes.</p><p><strong>Soulframe has been described as a sister project that will exist alongside Warframe. Like you said, there's a lot different between the two, but is there any potential for crossover content or stories? Is that something that the team has discussed or is open to?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yes. Nothing we can commit to yet, but we've definitely talked about fun ways to see if there are ways to tie these worlds together. See if we can plant seeds that, people who are fans of DE and played DE games, would notice and call out.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Like this company does [points to shirt featuring Disney’s Monsters, Inc.].</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> [Laughs] Like that company does. Yeah, exactly.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> There was a two-week window, where it was like, 'Is this Tau?' If you know Warframe lore, it's like, 'Is this the alternate world that the players have never been to?'</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> It won't be. We talked about it.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We did talk about it. Some of those decisions, I think, are about avoiding strong coupling dependencies so that the Warframe team can cook and we can cook, vice versa.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We do take our world-building very seriously. We try to create rules that we really stick to. I think that's the thing: if we ever do talk about that and get to the point, we want to make sure it's something that can fit within those rules we establish.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> If you know that Ignis Wraith in Warframe, we recently put something in called Ignus Wroth [laughs]. It's these little, silly ways, sometimes. Maybe it’s a little cheesy, but I think it’s great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Warframe for a lot of people, myself included, has a pretty steep learning curve. Is that something that the team is considering while developing Soulframe? Is it going to be, maybe, easier to get into, or is it more for people who have played Warframe and know that there's a lot of these systems that they're going to have to learn and manage?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> At least the first few – knock on wood – years of Soulframe, we will be trying to go simpler. I mean, even Warframe was simple. It was like a Dead Space mod system in the ancient days. Of course, we had to change it because you had a fixed number of permutations, and that's great for a single-player game, but for a game that someone is going to sink 500 hours into, going, 'I'm done,' is just not engaging over the long term. So, we talk a big game about making Soulframe simpler [laughs], and I think we're just trying to keep a lid on it, but it's boiling and we're like, 'Come on, don't make it more complex than it needs to be!' But we are making a slower game. A game that, I think, is less twitchy if you want it to be. If you're into the melee combat, there's parry windows, and there are dodge i-frames, but it is not a Soulsbourne type of game. It's more in the spectrum of something like Ghost of Tsushima or Breath of the Wild. It's not quite that far. We do love action, and we do love combat, but as we develop the game, we're going to also be creating a larger space for people that don't have those great timing skills and can't beat the Godskin Duo without help. There's gonna be that kind of spectrum of a casting type, you know, bow mains that might want to sit back and be using support abilities. I think it's sort of going after a slightly different audience there.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> There is a power fantasy in Warframe. We want to still keep a taste of that in Soulframe.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Yeah, where you can sort of grind and overcome anything if you've got to crank it up. Warframe has that, of course, in spades. We were talking about this yesterday after looking at our two demos. It's like, Warframe enemies live for, like, a few seconds. Maybe not. We call it popcorn, right? In Soulframe, our biggest challenge on the design and presentations side, which has been a massive uphill battle for us, is how long a single enemy lives on screen. How to make that look good. There's new pressure on animation, on where their head is turned, because you have all this time to soak it in. Things that, you know, Nintendo and Fromsoft or Sucker Punch know well, but for us, it's like, OK, usually, those guys are on the other end of a machine gun. Now, we're dueling and slowly waiting, and he's tiring out. So, that's been our biggest challenge, but I think that affords, maybe, a little slice of a different audience, I hope.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Warsong Prologue Fable Screenshots / Concept Art - TennoCon 2024</h3></div></output><p><strong>With that in mind, how does co-op work, then? These enemies are on screen longer, but in Warframe, you throw another player in there, and the enemies are just melted quicker. So, how does co-op factor into Soulframe's gameplay experience? Is it drop in, drop out?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> You can invite people into your party in a very similar way right now. Something we're working on, design-wise, is how they are going to function together as a team. So, perhaps, in the future, some Pacts will feel more supportive, whereas other ones can be like a sneaky Pact.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's borrowed stuff from Warframe, and it's kind of like grouping up in Cetus a bit, but we hope to make this a lot more seamless. My dream is, when you go into that soul mode, and you can see the energy stuff and you can see the ancestors, that you would see a radius of other players who might be open for grouping up, and that you could kind of just jump into their instance and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We have ambitions, too. I kind of spoke about the ancestry stuff where, we're gonna have an ancestor tree in our Nightfold that might keep a record of players you've met, people you've played with, and you can look back and almost make a family tree in the game, to see where you came from. Maybe there might be some perks associated with that, depending on how you line up. So, things that we're trying for that can reinforce the themes.</p><p><strong>The Nightfold reminds me of Warframe's Orbiter, so then is it a space that we can customize like that?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> Yes. Someone you're gonna meet at Tennocon is Verminia, who is our rat queen fashionista. She's gonna be where you can customize things, and at the end of what we're demoing, you will see a little bit of that. I know fashionframe is a really big part of our community in Warframe that's very well-loved. Even really just the lore of Soulframe, there's so much that could go into that which would make sense.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Our goal is to put more wandering ancestors in the world, and these people can hang out in your Nightfold. We have ambitions to let ancestors that we have in there now walk about a little bit, and then yes, like different ways that you can kind of decorate and set up that personal space of yours.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/21/soulframe-screenshots-verminiaancestor-2-1721598135659.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Digital Extremes says the Fashionframe community was "top of mind" when Soulframe was coming together.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Is the fashionframe community something the team considered when creating Soulframe?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Top of mind, for sure. It's even a personal investment, myself. I make sure to critique everyone who plays our games, like on the dev team, I'm just like, 'What are you doing? Put some clothes on.' It's like any game. You give the option to wear underwear? I don't know, I don't understand it [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair: </strong>There's something hilarious about fighting a giant monster stag in your underwear.</p><p><strong>One thing that's kept me coming back to Warframe is its monetization model. It's something that most Warframe players who stick around adore about the game. How will Soulframe compare to its sister project in that regard? I'm curious if there will be something like Platinum or if Platinum itself will return, and if in-game markets will be available for players to trade items between one another.</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> Stay tuned for more!</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We suffered our bruises in 2012 as we were launching the game, and I made a whole bunch of mistakes, like charging people to uncap their max level and stuff like that. The community, rightfully, gave me a huge earful. I always remember the story of reading a very angry forum post about this feature. It's called Supercharge, I think. Of course, I looked up the player's account, and they had spent a ton of money in the game and supported it. They weren't advocating for themselves, they were advocating for the other people they wanted to play with. They were more than happy to throw money at the screen, at the cool stuff that we were offering, but they did not like the fact that it created a two-class system have 'I paid so my max level is 30, and yours is 15.' Then, we ripped it out. So, we've learned those painful lessons, and we have scars to remind us.</p><p><strong>Pivoting back to customization, I love how nature in the environment is incorporated. It's such a pivotal, important part of Soulframe. We've seen our mount and the bird. Can these creatures be customized in any way?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Oh, we're definitely having hats for the bird. For sure. I've already been talking to Rosa [Lee], who's our art director. We're going to be making little outfits for the bird, the wolf has the necklace and the earrings that we can swap out, we have our paint patterns. Yes. 100%, yes. We want to reinforce that in any way we can for sure.</p><p><strong>Is the mount usable in Preludes yet?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> [shakes head no] It's functional. We're purposely holding it back because we're slowly growing the world of Preludes, and we don't want to step on the function of exploration too early. It's not quite big enough yet. I know players that are in Preludes are so excited to get it. I don't know, maybe we just need to make a track room in the Nightfold where you can run on a treadmill with your mount. I love it to death. It's just... we need the world to support the faster mobility that it can offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>I was also curious, then, if there's any desire to create other traversal options. Obviously Warframe has a list of ways to get around. Is that something that Soulframe will offer?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> The wacky thing about Warframe, if you recall, Geoff, we had coptering.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> But the levels had been built for a third-person shooter with no coptering. It was a button hack to project yourself forward at a crazy fast moment. Zoren coptering, it was called, and we didn't love it, so we redid it. That's where the aim gliding and the bullet jumping and all that stuff came in, but the poor level designers, they built so much of the game without that movement system and without those movement hacks in mind. They sometimes still have to deal with the consequences of it. I just saw a video yesterday of the [Warframe 1999] stuff with wall-running problems. I think we are probably going to be a little bit more reserved. That's the beautiful flow of Warframe, and I think we're going to try to do something different that. Going back to that line we drew, there's more methodical stuff. We're going to try to respect the level a little bit more. I think that's one part that's absolutely stunning from FromSoft games, is the level design just matters so much. The topology and the puzzle of it, and 'How do I get there?' We want to try to explore that a little bit more than just 'I’ll just jump and bullet jump down there and just glide for a bit.’ So, I think we are kind of going a little bit different. That said, there's still cool Garron moments and other kind of short-term things, right?</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> And I am sure we're going to explore animal Pacts. We have some designs on paper right now, even, but I'm positive we're gonna have some animal Pacts that will give a taste of this as well.</p><p><strong>Still looking at level design then, you hesitated to talk about the term open world during our presentation yesterday. I'm curious why that is, and if it's not an open-world game, then what is it?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Steve, what is it? You said it. [laughs]</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's an overworld game!</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We do have a big map, a big island, let's call it for now, that is traversable, but we're trying to figure out our progression system and locking and scaling and how you grow your access to the world. I think we're hesitant to call it open world because unlike Zelda, you can't just walk out of the cave and go to the other side of the map. We want to put in barriers, we want to put in gates that you have to earn access to, and within each of those, we have our procedural levels. I think we call them dungeons right now, but we have our forest proc and our under-city proc, and we're building a few others that are pretty expansive and then I think eventually also will be conduits from one part of the world to another part that you can only get through there. So, we don't want to undercut that effect by being able to just go over top and get to it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think I'm hesitant to say open world because we're putting a lot of effort into the understory of that island. I don't want to paint a picture in someone's mind of like, Far Cry.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I think I'm hesitant to say open world because we're putting a lot of effort into the understory of that island. I don't want to paint a picture in someone's mind of like, Far Cry. You know what I mean? It's more like, there's exploration and that's a big emphasis in the game, but there's also a lot of Diablo or Warframe-esque procedural dungeon content, about as much. So, I guess that's maybe why I'm avoiding that term. Plus, it's kind of an abused term, isn't it? I've seen I've seen games called open world, and it's just like, tunnels. There's a tree so it's open world, I guess? One of my favorite parts of the game right now, that we just added, is you have these encounter systems, tasks that are popping up as you play Preludes. So, once you clear the quest, it's gonna be like, 'Oh, there's a, there's a big VIP, or there's like a hunting party nearby. My favorite thing to do in the game is fire it up and just run through the overworld, waiting for these things to crop up, how the night falls, it gets more spooky. That's the type of player I am in MMOs as well, which is, ‘Leave me alone. I'm just gonna go for a run by myself for this whole session.’ So yeah, it does have those elements, but I think we're just being stubborn and trying to be like Starbucks about it. It's not large, it's Grande. I can't help myself.</p><p><strong>I totally get that. It definitely feels like Warframe in that regard, and it didn't really hit me until I was deep in a dungeon. I was like, 'Oh, it's like I went on a mission, but I took myself there.’</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair: </strong>Yeah, and I think one of the cool things we did in the latest Preludes release is in [earlier versions] you go into a dungeon and we generate the layout kind of like Warframe and you get to the end you teleport out. Now, they're connected back into the overworld in interesting places, so when this went in I was so surprised because I went down into the dungeon, did my stuff, opened all my chest, came out, and I was right inside this fort, and it was just crawling with enemies. I was, like, behind the bookshelf, like some sneaky Lannister character. It's such a simple change but such a great feeling that it made it feel -- it was sort of an illusion -- like it was all connected like that. It felt a little bit different than Warframe, which is a session. You play the mission, back to the Orbiter. Play mission, back to the Orbiter. So yeah, I was pretty proud of that. I didn't do anything for it, but I was proud.</p><p><strong>So, if we can start from one entrance and then exit from another side, is it possible for players to go the reverse way through the dungeon?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We're circling back.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Curse you for asking that.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yeah [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> No comment.</p><p><strong>That's totally fair.</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You made it sound so cool, Steve.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> The problem is the bookshelf only opens from the other side. Haven't you guys watched the movie Clue? There's no switch on the other side or fireplace. Yeah, right now, those are one way. We'll work on that. Maybe the next release will have something like that.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> That bookshelf you're talking about, I've seen some updates [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Oh, OK. So there's a lever on the outside, now?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/26/soulframe30minutesgameplay-ign-blogroll1-1693084476609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Digital Extremes wants players to feel connected to Soulframe's world.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Again, I really love how important nature, animals, the environment, all of that is. What are some of the other ways we can interact with the environment? Whether that be our settings and surroundings or creatures, that kind of thing.</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Yeah, we are scratching the surface right now.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I was just thinking of the encounters, the Ode Polluters, which are now called Ode'n Moaners, which I think is so funny. You can destroy the Ode'n Moaners, and it stops the Ode'n corruption going into the rivers. There's so much to play around with. I'm sure it will only continue to have aspects of this that connect to the environment.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We gave you a taste of our prologue that we're working on, with the bird flying to the mother. That's a big task we're working on this year, where you'll get some insight into the antagonists in the story, and what they're bringing to the game and the kind of what's causing the pollution. Then hopefully, from there, we'll be kind of broadening what those missions and those adversaries are. We have another faction in the works that represents what happens to this corruption when it goes too far. Which, there's some hint at the art that we kind of showed in the demo for where they're coming in. So, we're going to be leaning heavily into that. I think Steve and I are still scratching our heads about how to give the player meaningful change, being a force of change in this world, and having it persist in a multiplayer world. That's something we're really trying to figure out that we have ambitions for, for sure.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Does anyone remember Okami? The game where you have to draw? Oh, my god. So, you're playing, you play, you play for hours, and then you get that open part that's not really open world, you fight the thing and you draw stuff and then suddenly, the grass just goes green. It's just so wicked.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You just reminded me, we're working on our next omen beast quest, which is the bear. I'm not sure if you've seen the bear, we showed it PAX, a little footage of it, but it's going to have a big role. A big theme of it is what you've healed and what you restore back to the world after that quest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Lotus is a really important character in Warframe. She’s a character you spend so much time talking to and hearing. Does Soulframe have a Lotus equivalent, and will they be voiced by Rebecca Ford?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> She wishes! [laughs]</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> She's mad at us. She claimed ownership of our rat queen, and we went around her. We cast someone. So, yes and no. Our grandfather, who you might have heard some narration by, he's going to be a bit of that figure, but we're probably not going to lean into someone so individualistic like we did in Warframe. I think, again, just to reinforce the themes of ancestry, you're absolutely going to have people that play that role, but we're spreading out the function of it. That's why in last year's quest we had Orlick guiding us through what we need to do to heal Garron. With Verminia, who is the rat witch, she's giving us some insight into Bromius, our corrupted bear. So yeah, we want to reinforce the relationships we have with the ancestors and helping them as a progression path for the player as well. It's important to tie those two together.</p><p><strong>This is a bit of a goofy question, but it's called TennoCon. Will there ever be an EnvoyCon? Or will TennoCon serve as a hub for everything Digital Extremes is doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I think that it's gonna be the latter.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We talk about QuakeCon, as an example. We've had this conversation internally, like, 'What happens?' TennoCon was kind of earned.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> There will be a thunderclap from how hard I unclench if we ever get to the point that we would need an EnvoyCon. Again, obviously our dream is to get to that point.</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>It's weird. Why did we do this to ourselves? I've never felt as much pressure as I have since, probably, 12 years ago, right?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We're so thankful for Warframe, and to see it even growing, it's just like... whoa.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's because you've exposed yourself to failure again, and you forget what that 2012, do or die felt like. Then you look at the game industry in the last two years, and you go, 'no one's safe,' you know? We're so thankful for Warframe, and to see it even growing, it's just like... whoa. Even after all this brutality and blood. So yeah, we're hoping that we get to that, that we would have a debate with Rebecca. Because right now, we get an hour, and they get the whole day.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Which they've earned.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Quite so.</p><p><strong>Is the plan to offer the same amount of weapon variety in Soulframe as Warframe? Or will Soulframe stick to, maybe, a shorter list of weapons that can be fleshed out?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I don't want to speak for you and Geoff... actually, I'll just say something you said: there's not enough depth in the current weapons. Which I think speaks to a little bit less and maybe a little bit deeper.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Right now, we have weapons that represent factions in our game like the starting weapons actually represent the enemies. We have some that you get from ancestors, and there's definitely space for us to lean into representing, through function, those factions a bit more and how you play with them.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> But then, we'll just shit out the game with like, 1000 armor pieces you have to mix and match, right? That'd be amazing.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Or different kinds of underwear [laughs].</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>What does the team's ideal vision for Soulframe look like in 10 years?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I'll clearly be dead.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I'll be running the show.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Sarah will be the CEO, and I'll be dead, so maybe Sarah should answer the question.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> I remember when we launched Warframe, and I think a month into it, we opened it up, and people were playing it, and it was growing. I remember Steve, you going, 'You know, Geoff, if we're lucky, we might be able to get 10 years out of this.' I couldn't comprehend...</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I didn't say that, right?</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>You 100% did. It might have been within that first year, seeing where it goes and if we did it right. You weren't bragging at all.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I was probably warning you. Like, get off before it's too late [laughs].</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>I still have that naivete about it, I guess. We are very passionate about it, and we're just hoping we make something that connects with people, and we have the chance to grow. If you had asked me 10 years ago, 'Would Warframe have a boyband in it 12 years later?' That's kind of the joy of it. So many of the things we put in Warframe on the way, we would never have roadmapped that out. So, I really hope we get the opportunity to play in the same sandbox that we got to with Warframe with Soulframe.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I think we've been really grateful for the amount of people in our community already who have been so interested in playing. I know we're just focused on these foundational aspects and one thing at a time. That'd be amazing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"But, you know, the beautiful thing about how the company currently works and how it worked through Warframe, is it’s a whole bunch of passionate, creative people get to try weird stuff.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> You can see how we think, which is like... I think maybe a lot of other people in the gaming audience were exhausted by hype, were exhausted by oversell. So, we tend to under, under, undersell, right? The worst thing that could happen to me is someone sees that trailer and goes, 'Holy shit, this is going to be the game I've been waiting my entire life for. I was born and bottle-fed just for this game.' You see that create expectations. Cyberpunk was rad, but holy shit those expectations, right? Obviously, we would kill for that kind of marketing, but you know, sometimes I feel a little shy when Sarah's like sharing messages, like, 'I just want in! Give me a key!' It's like, OK, just relax. There's just a few ancestors in there right now. But, you know, the beautiful thing about how the company currently works and how it worked through Warframe, is it’s a whole bunch of passionate, creative people get to try weird stuff. They get to make mistakes. They get up to have wins. It's pretty safe for them to do that, and then they're blessed with a great connection to their audience. They see the feedback immediately when they work. It's not waiting three years and it's too late to change it. That's the joy of the live-service game. The un-joy is the speed and the relentlessness of it, but I think I could probably survive maybe four or five more years of that.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Stardew Valley is nearly a decade old at this point, but developer Eric Barone says he's still hard at work on the game's next PC update, as well as porting its existing content to its console versions.

That’s according to modder ThatBomberBoi (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>), who recently shared a glimpse of what appears to be the default graphics settings for No Man’s Sky on the upcoming hardware.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to take away from a comparison with the existing graphics defaults for the game on PS5. The clearest changes based on the datamine are that dynamic resolution scaling will go from 0.6 to 0.8 and graphical detail will go from high to ultra. It’s impossible to know from any of this just how much better a game like <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, originally released on PS4, will look on a PS5 Pro, but it certainly doesn’t seem like the new hardware will be a major jump. </p><p>That was already the take away <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329">from the reported specs</a></span>, which point to a slightly better CPU and a much beefier GPU. An early analysis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span> speculated that for simulation-heavy games like <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a PS5 Pro would certainly improve performance but not get close to managing 60fps in 4K. In that regard, the new hardware keeps sounding more and more like a PS4 Pro, which offered enhancements but didn’t feel like a must-have upgrade. </p><p>But the other big question around the PS5 Pro is when it will actually launch. With the base model reaching its 4-year anniversary this fall, the timing is perfect for a refresh, maybe to be revealed at or around a potential September showcase. That’s basically what Sony did with the PS5 Slim last year, announcing it just a month before it went on sale. <em>The No Man’s Sky </em>datamine suggests developers are already preparing for its arrival.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I still won’t use it, but good for you all on evidently cracking this game wide open.<br></p><p>I sincerely <em>do not </em>understand the amount of things that Ainrun uses prior to the fight and their various effects.

He also uses Ash of War techniques, which are abilities often tied to specific weapons that use FP (<em>Elden Ring</em>’s mana), like a flag standard that buffs Ainrun and a literal act of seppuku.<br></p><p>By the end of the exhaustive list, Ainrun is rocking something like a dozen buffs at once. With all the various items and techniques rattled off, including a weapon change, he enters Radahn’s arena, uses one more Ash of War skill, and then launches a charged heavy attack as the boss rushes to close the distance between them. You can barely make it out due to Twitter’s video compression, but that single attack does 93,000 points of damage to Radahn, completely nuking his health bar.<br></p><p>It’s a move so potent, it triggers Radahn’s second-phase cutscene and also <em>skips </em>the entirety of the actual phase.

Radahn’s move <em>does </em>connect and manages to kill Ainrun, but with the boss defeated, only Ainrun will return and be able to claim victory.<br></p><p>As busted as Radahn’s fight at the end of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is—and for the record, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">it’s <em>really</em> broken and not in your favor</a></span>—it’s almost been worth it to see how players like Ainrun craft builds to meet the challenge. There are obviously much simpler ways to buff yourself, like using just a modicum of the skills Ainrun deployed here rather than the full gamut. You can top up on Scadutree blessings to meet Radahn’s immense strength via <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s independent leveling system, but it’s especially satisfying watching folks go off the deep end and develop wildly cracked builds instead. Hats off to FromSoftware for allowing players to break the game in their own favor, and to the community that has risen to the occasion and shown Radahn what’s what.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Concord is in the midst of holding its open Beta on Steam, and the numbers, to be honest, haven’t been good.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3011460/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the beta for Concord has a peak player count of just 2,388 players, which happened on Thursday, July 18. Since then, the numbers have continued to drop from an already disappointing level. July 19th saw a max of just 1,654 players; July 20th, 1447; and July 21st, 1,117 players.</p>



<p>Again, this was a completely free and open beta over a weekend for a game that PlayStation has been targeting as its big hero shooter. If the numbers were that low when anyone could play, it’s hard to imagine what they’ll be when the game fully launches at its $40 base price.</p>



<p>Immediately after the full reveal of the game back in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players seemed turned off by the game</a> for a number of reasons. One of the big reasons being the seemingly bait and switch of a CGI trailer that showed an adventure only to be shown 5v5 FPS gameplay. </p>



<p>Based on the Beta numbers, it seems like the  negative sentiment hasn’t change over the last month or so.</p>



<p>We don’t have the numbers publicly available for how the game has performed on PlayStation. Neither Sony nor developer Firewalk have responded to requests for comment on the state of the game based on the early Beta returns.</p>



<p>Concord is currently scheduled to release August 23 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flock-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a lot of friends who are birders, a hobby I get in that you wander around outside and look at animals, and a hobby I do not get in that it sounds a little bit like a combination of homework and an eye test. But I love when I <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1660639329532669952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask a pal</a> about some bird I saw and they come back with a ton of interesting facts that make me think more deeply about the world around me. <em>Flock</em>, a critter-identifying game that came out last week, hits some of those notes.</p><p>In <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/games/flock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Flock</em></a>, you play as a newcomer to an island that’s home to a range of creatures, which you’ve come to help catalogue. You travel the landscape on a giant bird, swooping among the wetlands, forests, and stone structures looking for signs of life. When you spot a creature, you study it for a bit, then open your creature guide and choose its family before using provided clues to narrow down exactly what sort of critter it is. It might be easy to tell it’s a bewl because it looks like a little sausage, but is it a belted bewl or a collared bewl? As more areas open up, more creatures get added to your guide.</p><p>As per the title, you can also gather a flock of creatures of your own, by finding their missing calls via whistles hidden throughout the world. Using these whistles, you can charm creatures into a pack that trails around behind you. You’ll occasionally need to do this to find other creatures in your guide, but as far as I can tell, mostly they just look cool. (<em>Flock</em> has a multiplayer component where I imagine these followings look very impressive, but I have only played single-player.)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Flock - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNi2ytZDJeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>All this might just sound like checkboxes, but I found filling out the creature guide charming and compelling. <em>Flock</em>’s developers are behind one of my favorite indie games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wilmots-warehouse-is-a-great-puzzle-game-1837879681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em></a>, which is also about categorizing things; unlike the taxonomy you create for yourself in that game, <em>Flock</em>’s categories are about making sense of a world that already exists. You discover a robust ecosystem and learn creatures’ habitats and behaviors, see their variation across regions or times of day. It helps that the creatures are all delightfully designed and have their own distinctive calls. I most enjoyed swooping through an area, following the clues in my guide to look for some specific creature while being able to identify all the sounds around me.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>Flock </em>is very chill; it’s pretty gentle if you get a family or creature wrong, and it strikes a good balance of sometimes being tricky without turning into some kind of hidden object game. There are challenges you can complete for side characters, as well as the ability to change your character’s appearance via wool you shear from sheep you find and graze, but mostly I just enjoyed looking for weird little guys, being surprised when something I thought was a rock blinked back at me, or following some kind of floating whale on its journey across the landscape. It’s a lovely game to kick back with at the end of the day, exploring its colorful landscape and learning about its world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-rare-gold-nes-cartridge-up-for-10k-at-auction.933654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gold-nes-cartridge-auction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A super-rare Nintendo World Championships<em>&nbsp;</em>NES cartridge is about to be put up for auction at $10,000, and it's apparently the first of its kind to be publicly sold in ten years.</p>
<p>If you know your onions when it comes to rare games, you'll almost certainly have heard of&nbsp;Nintendo World Championships. The original event was held in 1990, and a special commemorative cartridge was made available to finalists as part of that event.</p>
<p>An extremely limited number of those cartridges - twenty-six, to be exact - were given out as prizes by Nintendo Power, and it's one of those gold cartridges that's going up for auction later today. The whole affair was a big part of the inspiration behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">this year's Switch game</a>&nbsp;<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-auction-rear-view.jpg?itok=4Y3y0mQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-auction-rear-view.jpg?itok=sGHZk-oi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not look like much, but this cartridge is expected to fetch $10,000 at auction.</figcaption></figure><p>The auction is being held over on auction site <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1990-nes-nintendo-gold-world-championships-missing-cartridge-usa-cartrwlodh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goldin</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/PatTheNESpunk/status/1814737375467348375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pat the NES Punk</a>), and the starting bid is $10,000, although given how rare these cartridges are, the final sale will almost certainly be for more than that.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about this particular cartridge is that it's missing its label; the Nintendo World Championships cartridges all had a triangular label with the event's logo on it, but that label is absent here.</p>
<p>Whether or not that affects the final sale amount remains to be seen. After all, the cartridge is still exceedingly rare; as Goldin itself points out, only thirteen of the original 26 gold cartridges remain in existence at last count, and Pat the NES Punk says this is the first time one of these cartridges has been on public sale in a decade.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition.jpg?itok=0EqC0H46 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition.jpg?itok=E2C0wMQ5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo recently nodded to the Nintendo World Championships with a speedrunning-focused Switch game.</figcaption></figure><p>Per price tracking platform <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/nintendo-world-championship-gold" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Price Charting</a>, the last known public sale for a Nintendo World Championships cart was in 2015, when an eBay listing sold for a whopping $26,677. With that in mind, $10,000 seems a relatively low starting bid, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Thankfully, none of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-allegations-surface-in-retro-gaming-auction-controversy">companies involved</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wata-games-lawsuit-filed-california-aleged-deceptive-activities">explosive price-fixing scandal</a> of a few years ago are participating in this auction, and although that doesn't guarantee a lack of skulduggery, it does at least make it less likely for those who are paying through the nose for a collector's item like this.</p>
<p>In any case, the Goldin auction for this super-rare Nintendo World Championships cartridge begins at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific) tonight. If you've got the cash lying around, you could even bid for it if you want!</p>

Not only does this make it available on modern platforms with new bells and whistles, but you can play it right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game was originally launched in 2003 for the Neo Geo arcade before it was ported to PlayStation 2 (in Japan) and Xbox in the U.S. It pits 36 fighters from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters, Samurai Shodown, and Metal Slug 2 against Capcom fighters from series like Street Fighter, Mega Man, Darkstalkers, and more.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqjMpn6JrYQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>SVC Chaos now features quality-of-life updates such as a hitbox viewer, rollback netcode for online play, and an art gallery. It also makes formerly secret characters Athena and Red Arremer available from the start. The game's surprise launch on Steam on July 20 followed its reveal, and it comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch today. You can pick it up now for $19.99.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft hopes that Star Wars Outlaws will become a highly successful game with a huge player base. However, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-has-no-plans-to-delay-star-wars-outlaws/">10-minute gameplay video</a> released on IGN's YouTube channel suggests that may not be the case. Fans seemed outraged at the quality of the game, claiming it looked unfinished and had uneven FPS. However, Ubisoft is confident that it has funneled more money into Star Wars Outlaws marketing than for any of its other games.</p>
<p>This information comes from a recent financial update from Ubisoft, where the company's CEO revealed that the firm has been putting more money and effort than ever into the marketing of Star Wars Outlaws. With this, he said that he expects a strong launch for Star Wars Outlaws, based on "positive community sentiment," which is highly contradictory to the immense amount of negative feedback they received when they released the gameplay video for Star Wars Outlaws. It was so intensely negative that a financial advisor from the Bank of America even asked if they would consider delaying the game, which received a firm "no" as a response.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot also said, "It's among the most awaited games of the industry this year." The second half of 2024 is set to see massive releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and the Silent Hill 2 remake, to name a few. Plenty of other huge contenders are out there for the most anticipated game of the year, so it'll be interesting to see how it shapes up for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft</a>, more footage will be released later to showcase more of the gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws. The dev team is confident that this gameplay will generate a huge amount of hype for the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is confident that the next few months of this year will be revolutionary for them as a business. Fans have the long-awaited release of Assassin's Creed: Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws to look forward to. In addition to these stand-alone games, Ubisoft has put a huge amount of effort into its live-service games, such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six Siege, both of which have gone on to surpass expectations this year alone.</p>

It’s a no brainer. </p><p>Dodge Attack is the Steel tree’s first skill and as you’ll be doing a lot of dodging in Flintlock, it will immediately come in handy. This skill grants you the ability to instigate an immediate follow-up attack after a dodge, meaning you can stay mobile and avoid attacks while continuing to pummel your foes into submission.</p><h2 id="h7"><a id="charged"></a>Charged Attack</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree: </strong>Steel</p><p>After picking up Dodge Attack, you can snag Charged Attack, which lets you hold the attack button down to—you guessed it—charge a powerful attack. The longer you hold the charge, the more powerful the blow will be. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-upgrades-tips-difficulty-feathers-prime-enki-1851600254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-upgrades-tips-difficulty-feathers-prime-enki-1851600254"><em>Flintlock</em>: Six Tips To Build Your Power And Slay Your Foes</a></span></p><p>This devastating attack can demolish many smaller enemies in a single hit and it’s an excellent option against larger foes who have just finished their attack strings.</p><h2 id="h8"><a id="momentum"></a>Momentum</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree: </strong>Steel</p><p>After the previous two Steel skills are purchased, you’ll be able to buy Momentum. This passive ability gives you a 10-percent damage boost and improves your swing speed every time you press the attack button at the exact moment your last attack hits the enemy. </p><p>It can be tricky to time this just right in the heat of battle, but once you get the rhythm down, you’d be surprised at how quickly 10-percent extra damage per swing adds up—especially against bosses.</p><h2 id="h9"><a id="rend"></a>Rend Spirit</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree: </strong>Magic</p><p>The first skill in the Magic tree is called Rend Spirit. It grants you the ability to hold down the Enki attack button to have him suspend an enemy in the air. By doing so, you’ll not only be able to take a quick breather, but you’ll also build up Enki’s Withering gauge. This will let you unleash powerful attacks that can completely change the course of a tough battle.</p><h2 id="h10"><a id="taunt"></a>Taunt</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree: </strong>Magic</p><p>With Rend Spirit purchased, grab Taunt from the Magic skill tree next. With this skill, Enki will taunt your opponents in combat when there’s more than one enemy. This helps to keep the battlefield under control in larger-scale encounters, making it one of the most useful skill purchases in the game.</p><h2 id="h11"><a id="restrain"></a>Restrain</h2><p><strong>Skill Tree:</strong> Magic</p><p>After you buy Taunt, you’ll be able to grab Restrain. This will cause Enki to jump on enemies in combat and restrain them for a while. The frequency in which he’ll perform this action is based on how much danger you’re in, but rest assured that when you’re overwhelmed by enemies, he’ll frequently take action and help you out to give you some breathing room.</p><hr><p>While there are many great skills in <em>Flintlock</em>, and you should mix and match as you can easily refund skills, these six will provide an excellent foundation for a variety of playstyles. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Partially, yes. It gives us reveals that could have been delivered episodes earlier, action that would have been cooler a generation ago, and (SPOILER) the death of perhaps the greatest Jedi character the franchise has seen, all to remind us that the <em>Star Wars</em> universe is only as good as the filmmaking behind it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194617,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode 8,&nbsp;“Doom,” begins where we left off, with Osha (Amandla Stenberg) donning Qimir’s (Manny Jacinto) sensory deprivation helmet. Since the helmet leaves her alone with the Force, she experiences an uninterrupted connection to her own power similar to her mother’s—the ability to put others into a trance as she freezes Qimir in his own mindscape. That’s a pretty cool development, but due to the pacing of the series, we don’t get a payoff to this ability. Therein lies the biggest flaw of the show: it’s underwritten, without enough meaningful content to justify its own pace. From episode 1 on, <em>The Acolyte</em>’s directorial style all too often misses opportunities to give deeper meaning and emotional context to moments. </p><p>By this eighth episode, we’ve grown to expect long, drawn-out reveals, such as when Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) is about to tell Mae what she and Osha truly are as a byproduct of a Vergence, only to be shocked by Mae before finishing his sentence. Cookie-cutter writing like this held the series back from exploring more meaningful ideas in the allotted time for the episodes. The show would’ve benefited from a faster pace and more exploration of the little things that make life “in a galaxy far, far away” interesting. </p><p>For instance, according to Sol, Osha and Mae are not twins or sisters, but rather are the same person, conjured and split in two by their mother using the Vergence in the Force on their home world of Brendok. That’s cool, but the story doesn’t convey why we should care about this, other than it being rare.<br></p><p>Considering him a liar that murdered her mother, Mae tried to lose Sol in a space chase that is surely one of the best in <em>Star Wars</em> history. Flying through a Saturn-like planetary ring is simply good sci-fi. I’ve never seen it done before with such attention to detail. This scene is another instance where <em>The Acolyte</em> delivers something fresh that expands our collective minds, thereby pushing the boundaries of science fiction as a genre. Applause for this scene.</p><p>We’re introduced to Senator Rayencourt (David Harewood) in a meeting with Master Vernestra (Rebecca Henderson). The Senator brings a challenging perspective to the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, believing Jedi to be hypocrites of the self-control they preach, predicting that one day one of them will lose control and cause big problems for the galaxy. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of being a prequel, but his motives feel overly convenient, designed to fit the needs of the story rather than character-driven. However, Harewood’s portrayal of the character is strong, and a good counter-balance to Henderson’s stressful-yoga-teacher Jedi. In their first shared scene, the senator delivers the powerful line, “When you’re looking up at heroes, you don’t have to face what’s right in front of you.” I find this remark to be very timely, aligned with how we as a culture are increasingly questioning who and what we model ourselves after.</p><figure id="" data-id="2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-recommend-id="image://2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-format="jpg" data-width="810" data-height="457" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-recommend-id="image://2ab739d9e5878c8e1e83f9739b3be320" data-format="jpg" data-width="810" data-height="457" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jedi Master Sol at the controls of a spaceship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We get more great acting when Sol enters the ruins of the burnt temple on Brendok. Sol walks up to where he’d had to make a decision to save Osha or Mae as they fell from a bridge 16 years earlier. Deeply unsettled by the memory, Sol steps back, almost as if his limbs are glued to the space and he’s pulling himself free with every step, contorting his body as he paces backwards. The body language here is outstanding, and for me solidified Lee Jung-jae’s portrayal of Sol as the most dynamic acting across all of <em>Star Wars</em> to date. I hope Lee is showered with accolades for his work in this series.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, that level of excellence doesn’t carry over to the finale’s big face-off. The fight choreography for the finale feels like the action design team had some creative limitations put on them, with very basic martial arts moves being shown in slow motion, as if they were special for a Jedi or Force-wielder. This is a stark difference from some of the amazing action moments in earlier episodes. The fight between Osha and Mae is incredibly plain, and feels more like a stunt person posting their reel on Instagram to build a following rather than the grand finale of a <em>Star Wars</em> show. The Qimir/Sol fight has a similar feel, like we’ve see it all before.</p><p>The battles end with Osha choosing to kill Sol. The show died there for me. The most interesting character and best actor in the series is no more. The tension of Sol confessing to the Jedi has vanished. Osha and Mae flee, and we are left with new questions as Master Vernestra arrives with a squad of Jedi. She learns the truth from psychic impressions in the space, chooses to cover it up in front of the Senator and council meeting, and now we see that the Jedi are flawed too. Oh, and Vernestra formerly trained Qimir. And Vernestra reports to Yoda. And I’m not sure if watching anymore is worth it.</p><p>I love art. Art can be interpreted in infinite ways, and everyone can find something if they simply take a moment to appreciate it. Then there are time-waisters,&nbsp;shows and other media that simply exist to keep printing money with mindless viewership. <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 8 has elements of both, and is perhaps the best example of the series being full of the same. Some episodes were truly powerful, some moments raised the bar for <em>Star Wars</em>. Overall, I’m left feeling that <em>Star Wars</em> wants to keep the same cyclical storytelling going, with masters training students that turn to the dark side, causing people to either run away from them or run toward them to stop them. This pattern was boring when <em>The Force Awakens</em> released, and it hasn’t gotten any better. With the last image of the series finally being Osha and Qimir holding hands wrapped around the same lightsaber, I’m hopeful for the sake of all the talent in the show that they get to make another season, and I’m reminded that <em>Star Wars</em> lacks a definitive artistic voice at this point guiding it to do anything truly bold and original.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Cybertruck is marketed as bulletproof, but that won’t be the case in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>. So Cybertrucks are going to be shot and destroyed quickly by players, which may not be the <em>best</em> way to market your bulletproof e-truck to people. </p><p>But then again, it’s not like the folks behind the Cybertruck have had many good ideas to begin with, so why start now? As for Epic and <em>Fortnite</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/after-swiping-lots-of-fortnite-dances-from-black-artist-1835285124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/after-swiping-lots-of-fortnite-dances-from-black-artist-1835285124">while it’s not</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-racist-offensive-ai-images-art-zonewars-epic-1851209249&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-racist-offensive-ai-images-art-zonewars-epic-1851209249">the <em>worst </em>thing</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-epic-games-art-battle-royale-illustration-1849860511&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-epic-games-art-battle-royale-illustration-1849860511">the game has ever done</a></span>, it’s certainly up there. At the very least it’s the most embarrassing and cringe-y move from Epic in some time.</p><p>On the other hand, I saw some players suggest they would download <em>Fortnite</em> just to shoot and destroy some Cybertrucks, so perhaps Epic is on to something. I mean, I’m excited to watch Spider-Man and Ariana Grande shoot rockets at a Cybertruck the next time I play. So maybe this was a good idea after all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-for-new-returning-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a> today, publisher EA announced nearly a dozen of the anticipated voice cast for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>



<p>The cast includes a variety of veterans like Alex Jordan of Cyberpunk 2077, Bryony Corrigan of Baldur’s Gate 3, and more. The main character Rook will feature “four different voice overs to make this story truly your own.”</p>



<p>Notably, the blog also confirms that “Gareth David-Lloyd is returning as Solas, and Brian Bloom as Varric.” It adds that there will be other returning characters, though the devs did not confirm those just yet to avoid “story spoilers.” This implies there should be more surprising ties to existing storylines.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re incredibly excited to announce our cast for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard! </p><p>Rook: Alex Jordan, Bryony Corrigan, Erika Ishii, and Jeff Berg <br>Harding: Ali Hillis<br>Davrin: Ike Amadi<br>Bellara: Jee Young Han<br>Neve: Jessica Clark<br>Taash: Jin Maley<br>Emmrich: Nick Boraine <br>Manfred: Matthew… <a href="https://t.co/luaxR4GCtU">pic.twitter.com/luaxR4GCtU</a></p></div>— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1815403173944971266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Today’s announcement comes shortly ahead of Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s appearance at San Diego Comic Con, which will include a Voice Over panel. A few members of the cast from Dragon Age: The Veilguard will also offer a talent signing on July 25.</p>



<p>The devs teased that they will “talk soon” and “continue our summer filled with reveals.”</p>



<p>Last month, the developers revealed a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/watch-20-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twenty minutes of gameplay</a>, including both key mechanics and cinematics. BioWare reassured fans that the showcase only featured content from the “opening moments of the game” to avoid spoilers. </p>



<p>Most recently, fans asked about the potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nudity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nudity in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. BioWare did not provide a clear answer about genitals in the game, a mature RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Want your game to be showcased during Gamescom Opening Night Live (ONL)? Well, it’s going to cost you a pretty penny.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRaptor</a>, it can cost up to $288,000 (€265,000) to secure a spot on the main show. That is the max price and it comes with a 120-second spot on the broadcast. Want less time, it’s a little cheaper, but not much. A 90-second hit costs $234,000 (€215,000); 60 seconds, $179600 (€165,000); and 30 seconds will run you roughly $125,000 (€115,000). </p>



<p>If you don’t want to spend that much on the main show, you can get your game on the pre-show. However, it’s still quite pricey. For a 120-second hit on the preshow, it costs roughly $144,226 (€132,500). For 90 seconds, it’ll cost about $117,000 (€107,500); 60 seconds, $90,000 (€82,500); and for just 30 seconds, it’s still $62,500 (€57,500).</p>



<p>Despite the high cost, though, studios don’t seemed to be turned off as spots on the main show from Gamescom ONL have been sold out. You can, however, still <a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">book for the pre-show</a>.</p>



<p>And while it may come as a surprise to some, these prices are nothing new. For Summer Game Fest this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-trailer-price/">it reportedly cost $250,000 for just one minute</a>. If you wanted more time, like say 2.5 minutes, you were looking at spending over $500,000.</p>



<p>It’s not believed that <em>every </em>game has to pay. As some of the smaller indie games that get shown during these broadcasts likely don’t have the budget to afford such a massive price point. However, it’s still something to see the prices linked with a show like this.</p>



<p>Gamescom ONL 2024 airs on August 20 at 2pm ET, the day before Gamescom 2024 officially begins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"It has been an honor creating this game for our Kommunity," the developer <a href="https://x.com/mkonslaught/status/1814693409564549179" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said.</a></p><p>Mortal Kombat Onslaught was developed by NetherRealm Studios, the same developer behind the main series. No explanation was given for why Onslaught is shutting down. However, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-live-service-game-is-shutting-down-just-months-after-launch/1100-6520621/" data-ref-id="1100-6520621">not unprecedented for games to open and close in a relatively short period of time.</a></p><p>Recently, the CEO of Warframe developer Digital Extremes called on developers of live-service games to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-boss-bemoans-live-service-games-getting-axed-too-soon/1100-6525185/" data-ref-id="1100-6525185">try to stick it out and keep their games going instead of rushing to close them and move on. </a></p><p>Mortal Kombat 1, the twelfth entry in the main series, came out in September 2023. No new games have been announced, but the next movie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-supergirl-movie-release-dates-announced/1100-6523467/" data-ref-id="1100-6523467">Mortal Kombat 2, is set for release in October 2025.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/22/the-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-added-to-fortnite-tomorrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>On an almost weekly basis, Fortnite announces new crossover events, adding characters to its Battle Royale, Lego, and Festival modes. Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.</p>



<p>For the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word "cyber" in its name.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.</p>

<p>The Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg">aren't wielding a steel ball</a>.</p>

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Heihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released"> Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="http://sobieska/">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters, and each can also be purchased individually for $7.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite.933579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Tesla Cybertruck is set to make its official video game debut tomorrow, in Fortnite. 
</p>
<p>
Many other games have featured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>'s wheels before - but only via unofficial mods. The Cybertruck has been added by fans into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-the-cybertrucks-been-modded-into-gta-5">Cyberpunk 2077, Rocket League, GoldenEye 007, and even Minecraft</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Now, it's set to be ownable in a video game for real - years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-new-truck-looks-like-a-low-poly-90s-game-and-the-memes-are-rolling-in">memes spread online suggesting the Cybertruck looked like a PlayStation 1-era vehicle</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, developer Epic Games shared a trailer featuring Fortnite mascot Fishstick riding in a Cybertruck and pulling what I can only presume is meant to be an attractive face, blowing a kiss towards the camera. You can watch it below.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
The trailer is a nod to an official Tesla video of a Cybertruck in a tug-of-war with a Ford 4x4 (Tesla's original video shows the Cybertruck winning, though Ford said Tesla cheated and asked for a rematch). 
</p>
<p>
I imagine there will be people delighted that this silly-looking car is now available to buy, alongside so many other things, in Fortnite. But I also imagine some will baulk at the idea of handing over money, via Fortnite, to Elon Musk - who last week loudly backed the re-election of President Trump and pledged to donate $45m a month to his campaign. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté said he had to take "a step back" rather than immediately respond to Musk's online criticism</a> of the fact you play as real-life Black samurai Yasuke in upcoming game Shadows.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has reinstated former President Donald Trump's account, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-bans-trump-for-good-promises-further-policy-changes">permanent ban in 2021</a> following the storming of the US Capitol building.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear if this was specifically requested by the Trump campaign team. Eurogamer was provided the following statement from a Twitch spokesperson:
</p>
<p>
"We reinstated former President Trump's Twitch channel," it reads. "We believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president."

<p>
Further, Twitch has made it clear the same community guidelines apply to public figures.
</p>
<p>
"We continue to enforce our Community Guidelines and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules," the statement continues. "Twitch doesn't have a 'public figure policy', meaning all channels are equally subject to our guidelines, regardless of whether the channel belongs to a public figure."
</p>
<p>
Twitch banned Trump's account "due to the ongoing risk of further incitement of violence," it said at the time. "The President's statements continue to be interpreted as calls to action, and we are taking this action to remove the potential for harm to our community and the general public."
</p>
<p>
While news of the reinstatement broke over the weekend (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/twitch-unbans-donald-trump-we-believe-there-is-value-in-hearing-from-presidential-nominees-directly/">PC Gamer</a>) and Trump's account had not been updated, now it includes a live broadcast from Michigan and a 2024 campaign banner image.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US">Twitch's community guidelines</a> have clear rules on hateful conduct: "Twitch does not permit behaviour that is motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, including behaviour that promotes or encourages discrimination, denigration, harassment, or violence based on the following protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, colour, caste, national origin, immigration status, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, serious medical condition, and veteran status."

</p>
<p>
It also includes rules on breaking the law and off-service conduct - it's the latter that came into play for Trump's previous ban. "Twitch has clear rules that prohibit hateful conduct, harassment, or incitement of violence on our service, and we consider off-service events when making enforcement decisions," said Twitch in 2021 following Trump's ban.
</p>
<p>
Since the news broke of Trump's account being reinstated, contributions to Team Kennedy by Twitch CEO Dan Clancy have been discovered. Robert F Kennedy Jr is an anti-vaccine activist who was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56021904">banned from Instagram in 2021 for spreading misinformation</a>.

</p>
<p>
Clancy has responded, stating it was his wife who made the donation. "Not quite sure why it comes across in my name," he said. "Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy but don't take this donation as me being a fan either."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Lol. But somebody's figuring out what political donations have come from my family  I did not know this till I read it here. </p><p>My wife must have made this donation. Not quite sure why it comes across in my name </p><p>Don't take me saying this as being negative about Robert Kennedy…</p></div>— Daniel Clancy (@djclancy999) <a href="https://twitter.com/djclancy999/status/1814525958885679484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
He then followed up: "By the way, if you're curious about my political views, feel free to ask on my next live stream. Happy to share!" His <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/djclancy/schedule">Twitch stream schedule</a> is currently blank.

</p>
<p>
Twitch has been marred by scandal in recent weeks, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm admitted</a> he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020 after exchanging "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stardew-valley-dev-concernedape-speaks-about-ports-and-free-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Stardew Valley is an indie game that took the world by storm. Just one person, ConcernedApe, created it. While working on Haunted Chocolatier, he continues to release consistent updates for Stardew Valley across all platforms. The latest major update was uploaded for the game's PC version in March 2024, with players on other platforms still waiting to release 1.6.</p>
<p>As players eagerly await the news of when the 1.6 update for Stardew Valley will come to other platforms, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConcernedApe has released a small statement on X</a> to reassure fans that it is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>"The ports and the next PC update are still in progress. I know it's taking a long time; it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when I have any meaningful news." Most of the fan base supported this and appreciated his efforts.</p>
<p>Some players in the thread had a few additional questions they wanted answered from ConcernedApe. A discussion regarding free DLC and updates was initiated when someone tweeted in response to his statement asking about pricing.
