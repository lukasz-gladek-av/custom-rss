We had both the tabletop and digital versions and would regularly play together. There was something so intriguing about playing through an imaginary "Game of Life" and all of the challenges that came with it. Now that I'm an adult living <em>through</em> the game that is life, I find myself less entranced by the concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is probably why this collaboration with Jurassic Park exists in the first place. The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition is less about living your best life and more about holding onto it. The overall theme of this board game is really quite interesting, and with the price reduced under $20 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-spring-deal-days">Amazon's Spring Deal Days Sale</a>, it's definitely worth considering adding to your collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition Is On Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="292a2064-5743-4d4c-816f-7c9fa568207e" id="217105"><div id="217105" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Amazon discount, the Jurassic Park edition of this game actually drops below the price of the original. At just under $20, it's a great price for an officially licensed board game. While this isn't the lowest price we've ever seen on this board game, it is the lowest price we've seen in 2025 so far. If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket and are looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">fun family game</a> to play, this is a great option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The general theme of this game is very different from the original Game of Life. The goal is to hop into your all-terrain vehicle and race your way around the island collecting dinosaur eggs and park rangers before the hurricane hits. Instead of normal life obstacles, you'll be faced with hungry dinosaurs scattered across the board. The first one to make it all the way around the island and escape wins, and the rest are left to get eaten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original Hasbro board game, the Jurassic Park version is meant to be played with 2-4 players. It also has a suggested age rating of 8+, likely because of the whole getting eaten by dinosaurs aspect of the game.

          <p>Nvidia has seen its fortunes soar in recent years as its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">AI-accelerating GPUs</a> have become worth their weight in gold. Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/">&nbsp;released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>
<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, "How does DLSS Frame Generation work?" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>
<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p>

      Nvidia on G-Assist.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Nvidia demoed G-Assist last year with some impressive features tied to the active game. That version of G-Assist could see what you were doing and offer suggestions about how to reach your next objective. The game integration is sadly quite limited in the public version, supporting just a few games, like <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>There is, however, support for a number of third-party plug-ins that give G-Assist control over Logitech G, Corsair, MSI, and Nanoleaf peripherals. So, for instance, G-Assist could talk to your MSI motherboard to control your thermal profile or ping Logitech G to change your LED settings.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is reportedly launching in June, with a three-phase plan for rolling out both first- and third-party games throughout the rest of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>, various sources have claimed that Nintendo has a three-part plan for rolling out the Nintendo Switch 2 launch this year. Phase 1 starts with the launch of the Switch 2 in June, which will be supported by a number of first-party Nintendo games, like the next Mario Kart game, which was shown during the reveal trailer. June is also when more developers will get Switch 2 dev kits. <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1904574480174788630" rel="nofollow ">Analyst Daniel Ahmad</a> clarified on X that many developers already have Switch 2 dev kits, with Nintendo just expanding the number in June.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1636970947" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>
A new report has highlighted the "havoc" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s lack of a release date is causing among game publishers, as they attempt to draw up launch plans for their titles that won't put them on a collision course with Rockstar's all-consuming sequel - with one executive reportedly saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
Following comments made by EA's Andrew Wilson earlier this year suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">the publisher would be willing to shift the new Battlefield's release in order to avoid GTA 6</a>, journalist Christopher Dring spoke to a number of industry executives to understand how Rockstar's game was impacting their own decision-making behind the scenes - with the responses he received reflecting those previously expressed by Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">newly launched The Game Business podcast</a>, Dring shared a quote from the boss of "one of the biggest games publishers in the world", who didn't want to go on record. "Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market," the executive told Dring. "We don't want to be anywhere near that. We're working up multiple different plans for our title."
</p>
<p>
Another senior executive from a different publisher shared similar sentiments, telling Dring, "Even without GTA, it's immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there."
</p>
<p>
A third senior executive - the European boss of an unnamed triple-A publisher - highlighted additional concerns, specifically around the "fall" launch window previously touted for GTA 6's launch by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>. "We don't want to launch just before or just after the game," the executive explained. "If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early - which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates. Or go later, putting you up against the Black Friday sales."
</p>
<p>
"If we move out of 2025," the executive continued. "what if Rockstar do too? Will we have to push our game up or will we have to delay further? It's proven to be very stressful."
</p>
<p>
Dring said these kind of considerations are currently "causing a bit of havoc" across the games industry, and it's not just a problem for publishers looking to launch new releases; GTA 6's arrival is likely to impact the fortunes of live service games too. One "top 10 live service games" developer told Dring, "GTA 6 is basically a huge meteor and we will stay clear of the blast zone. We will nudge our updates back or forward three weeks to avoid it. Of course, the problem is everyone is going to do the same. So three to four weeks before or after GTA 6, you're going to get a load of live service games dropping content in what they believe will be the safe zone."
</p>
<p>
"It's obviously going to get a little bit messy," Dring observed. But as he also highlighted, history suggests publisher have good reason to be concerned. Looking back to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s launch in September 2013, Dring explained, 50 percent of the month's game revenue was for Rockstar's title - despite it only releasing half-way through September. As for GTA 5's launch week in the UK, Rockstar's game reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all games sold and 94 percent of all video game revenue - and the the title is also said to have accounted for two thirds of all games sold in the UK during the three-week "blast zone" following its release.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But as noted by Game File's Stephen Totilo during The Game Business podcast, there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September - given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.

                <p>Following its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">sudden closure</a> in August 2024, long-running video game magazine Game Informer is officially back. The staff announced the news earlier today in an official <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/letter-from-the-editor/2025/03/25/game-informer-is-back" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, writing, "The whole team has returned, and we can’t wait to connect with you again."</p><p>In the same post, Game Informer editor-in-chief Matt Miller went on to explain that the outlet was given a "new lease on life" following its acquisition by game studio Gunzilla. Furthermore, Gunzilla also rehired the entire team of folks working at Game Informer prior to its closure. Miller stated that because of this rehiring, the team is confident that they can maintain an "unbroken identity of who we are and what we represent."</p><p>Gunzilla, which is currently working on upcoming battle royale game Off the Grid, reportedly assured Game Informer staff that the company will operate independently of the studio, with "100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so" coming from the site's editorial team. According to Miller, Gunzilla Games sees "the same potential in Game Informer as our team does, and their encouragement to do so ethically and free of outside pressure is laudable."</p><p>In addition to Game Informer's website--which already includes many years of back content in addition to new posts and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/every-review-from-game-informers-hiatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reviews</a> of games that released while the site was shuttered--the outlet has confirmed that its print magazine is returning as well. Miller said the company's intent is to "bring back the magazine bigger and better than it was before, and add a host of membership and subscription benefits, including an expanded scope to our videos, streaming, and feature coverage, while also broadening the range of experts and partnerships we tap to bring you those perspectives." Miller ended the blog post by stating that additional information regarding membership and subscription options is coming, and encouraged those interested to create a new Game Informer account to stay up to date on details.</p><p>Prior to its closure last August, Game Informer was one of the longest-running video game outlets in North America, having launched in 1991. The company was shut down by former parent company GameStop (the video game store, not us!) in a decision that reportedly surprised its entire staff, as they were currently "70% done" with the outlet's next issue.</p>

We've seen a huge amount of workers, both creative, administrative, and technical, suffer massive layoffs and restructurings. Even the teams behind hugely successive games—like the Seattle-based team responsible for part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">Marvel Rivals</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">have been laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's part of the reason why Retora Games founder and adjunct professor Tyler Coleman has been creating unique class exercises and role play scenarios to help his students think about what sort of problems they might run into after they graduate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The best lessons come from failure, so how do we teach that in a hands-on way to our classes?" Coleman said, posing a question to an audience at his Game Developers Conference talk. "By not teaching them [these things] we are not preparing our students for the worst."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman has run some of his classes through one of four different experiments, each spanning a the majority of the school term, to prepare students for handling the tough environment of the gig economy, negotiating with unreasonable publishers and clients, dealing with the variety of hardships studios often experience, and handling the emotional toll of being laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Forcing failure with care">Forcing failure with care</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point Coleman emphasized before diving into each hands on exercise is that he was looking for feedback and ways to improve. These experiments had "mixed results," according to him and he was wary of negatively impacting his students and the way they viewed their own work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Forcing people to fail should be treated with care," he said. "As you do run a risk of creating real trauma if not planned carefully."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiment that stood out most was Coleman's Rapid Prototyping class, which had a group of students produce multiple small games in various groups throughout the school term. The program ended with the entire class working together on one project, with separate groups of students within the class representing different teams within a AAA studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The whole thing was doomed from the start," Coleman said. "They were using a 5 year old version of Unity they hadn't worked with before. The teacher (me) was intentionally bad with communicating design and intent. We had regular unexpected changes in the design bible."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman had meant for his teams to fail and he—posing as a senior figure in this fictitious studio —was the main antagonist for this experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the end of the program, Coleman held a meeting with all the teams and told them that they were being let go. All the work they produced was owned by the fake company that employed them. He posed a question to his students, what would you do if you couldn't use any of the work from this past term? In reality the work was owned by the students, but he challenged them with a scary possibility that may very well hit them one day.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several elements of the experiment went well, according to Coleman. Some of his students felt the emotional toll of losing their jobs. While stressful, it helped them understand that situations like that are often completely out of their control. There was nothing they could have done differently to prevent the layoffs. Many students reacted poorly to the news, but Coleman believed it was good for them to experience it in this type of situation rather than in the real world where they'd have to pay rent and other bills.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It also led them to update their resumes and LinkedIn profiles," he said, emphasizing that he wasn't pro-layoff in any way. "It helped them understand that the best thing you can do is connect to everyone else and build a network."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other elements didn't go as well. Several students thought they had failed the class, which made them panic. The bombshell of the layoff also happened at the very end of the quarter, which completely killed any excitement the class had heading into the end of the term. Luckily the class didn't fail, they received "severance A," according to Coleman. He plans to clearly communicate that the students could not fail this experiment going forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiments that Coleman ran were unorthodox, but quite relevant in an industry that's repeatedly shown that its workers can be let go at a moments notice to help improve quarter over quarter fiscal showings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman detailed a few things that he'd like to do differently going forward, including making some sort of time for actual lecturing as several of his experiments involved his students roleplaying. Those sessions could take hours and often ended up leaving no time for him to talk to his students directly at length about what they were doing, how they felt about it, and what he hoped they would learn.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game design professor also plans to possibly change the schedule of when he plans to "lay off" his students, making sure that it's midway through the term so that he can leave time for retrospectives and feedback and simulate what comes after a layoff—which is usually other opportunities and work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildgate-hands-on-with-a-20-player-outer-space-fps-that-mixes-sci-fi-with-sea-of-thieves.1144644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-hands-on-with-a-20-player-outer-space-fps-that-mixes-sci-fi-with-sea-of-thieves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess I sorta suspected the day would come when my inner despot would awaken to wreak havoc on the galaxy, but I was surprised just how quickly it went down, after just a few minutes with the upcoming space-faring shooter: Wildgate. This chaotic sci-fi first-person shooter blends PvE and PvP objectives alongside exploration and combat on foot and aboard a ship that requires multiple people to operate – a formula that may feel quite familiar to any fellow Sea of Thieves fans. But unlike Sea of Thieves, where the chaos of player-on-player piracy is a somewhat infrequent and optional distraction, in Wildgate it’s the primary focus, and the inevitable clash of geared-up crews left me feeling the same heart-pounding intensity of a battle royale, as I barked commands at my crewmates and watched my enemies become just another cluster of space debris.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate pits five teams of four players against one another in a competitive space heist where time is of the essence and anything goes in these 20-40 minute brawls. Though there are 20 players in each procedurally generated world, you’re unlikely to run into any rival crews at the outset, instead using the calm before the storm to explore the miniature dungeons scattered throughout the cosmos. By delving into these places, slaying enemies that lie within, solving minor puzzles, and claiming loot, my squad and I gathered upgrades to bring back to our ship, including more powerful turrets, better shielding for our ship, ammo, healing items, and personal weaponry to carry into future battles. But our real purpose behind conquering these places as quickly as possible was to find the one and only Artifact hidden in each map. By collecting this all-important relic, every opposing team would be notified that we’d done so and be given an ongoing ping of our location as well. Then it was a mad dash to the Wildgate, and if we could fend off the enemy long enough to get to it, we’d instantly win the match and leave our adversaries choking on our space dust. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wildgate - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, every single rival player on the map would throw their full weight into preventing our escape, which is where the hilariously fun, full-on chaos of Wildgate shows itself. Though you can respawn infinitely after being killed, if someone destroys your ship, you’re knocked out of the match for good when killed, giving PvP especially high stakes. Ship-to-ship space combat is an intense, highly cooperative effort where you’ll need to share responsibility for piloting, manning mounted weapons, and repairing damage. The tools you’ve looted along the way can make that job easier and can have a pretty profound impact on how you approach combat. For example, on one run my crew found a bunch of close-range turrets that encouraged us to get up close and personal with the enemy to do high damage, while in another match I found a long-range sniper turret that allowed me to chip away at the enemy from a distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you prefer a more subtle approach, you can always jump into space and jetpack your way aboard an enemy ship to blast enemies while they’re focused on piloting the ship, plant bombs to deal massive damage to their hull, steal the artifact out from under their noses if they’ve left it unguarded, or just hit the self-destruct button and defend the area until their core goes nuclear and wipes them out. This can turn the tables on an enemy that has better gear on their ship or has managed to outmaneuver you with their piloting skills by disrupting their ability to manage their vessel and pull focus from other, more pressing objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather not go through the trouble of hunting down an Artifact and racing through the escape gate, then you can do what I did and simply hunt down and eliminate every single enemy crew until you’re the last team standing. They can’t extract the Artifact if they’re dead, after all. This approach can prove especially effective since you’re able to scrap every downed ship for parts to add them to your growing arsenal. And if you’re especially slimy, like me, you can wait to ambush the enemy while they’re busy with a PvE dungeon, blowing up their ship while it’s unmanned, then swooping in to claim the hard-won loot from the area they were in the middle of clearing out. All’s fair in love and space piracy, my friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest, and after more than six hours I still felt like I was only just beginning to figure out the best strategies to pull off a win consistently. For example, I learned the hard way that if you’re chasing an enemy ship who is seconds away from escaping through the Wildgate and you’re bombarding them with everything you’ve got, you should probably make sure you’re standing far enough away to not also blow yourself up in the process, resulting in a draw. Unlocking new characters and gear as you score XP also provides some new options, like the birdlike character, Mophs, whose unique ability to become invisible when boarding enemy ships can be especially useful in pulling off subterfuge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the small taste, I already get the impression that Wildgate will be one of those games where crazy things happen every single match that send me howling to my friends in victory or defeat, then swapping war stories with anyone who will listen the next morning, and if it manages to pull that off, it could very well be my next squad-based obsession.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The first Title Update for Monster Hunter Wilds is rapidly approaching, with information on the upcoming update being revealed in the Monster Hunter Wilds showcase today. Title Update 1 will be arriving in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">critically acclaimed RPG</a> on April 4, 2025. This update will be adding a familiar face, as well as some new features and challenges for players to take on.</p>
<p>Last making an appearance in Monster Hunter Rise, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune will be making a return and heading into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Players will be able to unlock the mission by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest once they are Hunter Rank 21.</p>
<p>For a glimpse of what you can expect of this update on April 4, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6y-0sBUKGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as Mizutsune making a return, Arch-tempered Rey Dau will be making a debut in an Event Quest for players above Hunter Rank 50. This is designed for players who enjoy a challenge and want something that is beyond the Tempered monster hunts. Additionally, there will be a new Rey Dau Gamma armor set that players can forge as a reward.</p>
<p>Once players have reached Hunter Rank 50, there will also be a mission unlocked where players can hunt Zoh Shia again, where players will then be able to gather Zoh Shia parts for high-rank Hunter and Palico equipment.</p>

<p>The Title 1 Update for Monster Hunter Wilds will also be introducing the Grand Hub, where players will be able to socialize in new ways. This includes the new Barrell Bowling minigame, where you can earn useful items and pendants.</p>
<p>Also announced in the Monster Hunter Wilds March 2025 showcase was the return of classic gestures as free DLC. There will also be a Cosmetic DLC Pack 1 for Premium Deluxe Edition and Cosmetic DLC Pass holders. Through this, players will be able to give Alma a brand new outfit as well as the ability to change her glasses for free.</p>
<p>Overall, the upcoming Title Update for Monster Hunter Wilds is stacked with new hunts to go on, whether you're a high-level hunter or just getting started.

Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025. </p><p>You can see where I’m getting the <em>Sea of Thieves </em>vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:</p><p>It’s an ambitious mashup of genres. <em>Wildgate</em> boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Whether <em>Wildgate</em> has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime. </p><p> “<em>Wildgate </em>rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of <em>Wildgate </em>plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”</p><p>Today’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, <em>Sunderfolk</em>, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s <em>Mechabellum</em>, a  tactical mech auto battler with shades of <em>Total Annihilation</em> that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Solo dev Wootus of Wootusart Industries has announced that the 2D shooter and strategy title War Rats: The Rat em Up will be available in Steam Early Access from April 22nd. In War Rats, you are a Rat commander that has to lead troops into a battle against the forces of TechnoRat. In this world rats are the only inhabitants.</p>
<p><iframe title="WAR RATS: The Rat em Up. Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DO7p18xH3po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“As a solo dev, I would love to involve the players in shaping the game, especially when it comes to balancing. This kind of game can be very challenging for some players while for others it will be a breeze. I feel like Early Access would be a great place to get that balance right. I would also like people to be able to play the Singleplayer portion of the game without having to wait for Multiplayer to be finished”,</em>said Wootus.</p>
<p>War Rats battles are a mix of 2D action where you go and fight the enemy troops, and a base building as you command troops to construct things like turrets. You can also recruit more rat troops to face off against the enemy forces, as going alone will lead to absolute failure. The early access release will contain the full single player campaign as well as a skirmish mode that allows players to choose which map to fight in. The full release of War Rats, which is estimated to come out six months after the early access release, will contain co-op and PvP multiplayer. The additional modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Conquest. There will also be more single player content including horde mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-big-nightmares-visions-free-update-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Several years after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-gets-delayed-to-november-30th-on-pc-a-bit-later-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original debut on PC</a>, Warhammer 40K Darktide continues to be updated with big patches. Today's free update is called Nightmares &amp; Visions and adds a new wave-based activity, significant enhancements to the Havoc end-game mode (including four new mutators), an overhaul of the Ogryn talent tree, a timed special event, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New game activity - Mortis Trials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Wave-based feature:</strong> upon reaching level 13, players will be able to mash through waves of enemies in visions induced by the ship’s Psyker, Sefoni. Each time they venture into the Psyker’s visions, they will be able to build new and exciting playstyles by selecting randomized abilities and buffs for the duration of the trial.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Choose Your Indulgence, Shape Your Playstyle –</strong> Before the battle begins, players select an Indulgence, each offering unique buffs that enhance combat styles. Pyrokinetic and Voltaic focus on elemental damage, Fulminator blends both, Death Dealer excels in close-quarters ranged and melee combat, and Colossus boosts survivability.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Trials of Endurance –</strong> Mortis Trials unfold in 12 escalating waves, with every third wave introducing an objective to complete. Success grants supplies and stronger buffs, culminating in a final gauntlet where players unleash their full potential.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Uncover lore and backstories -</strong> By overcoming the Mortis Trials, players will unlock memory echoes, granting them access to secret information on some of the main characters present on the Mourningstar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc mode gets a refresh -</strong> The end-game experience testing the resolve of the most seasoned operative reaches a new juncture with improvements and new daunting challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Improvements:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc Assignment Rank Overhaul -</strong> Fatshark made progression clearer and more rewarding for all players. Now, everyone who participates in a mission will rank up if they meet the new progression criteria, making group play more fulfilling.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Introducing Campaigns to Havoc -</strong> To keep gameplay fresh, Warhammer 40K Darktide will introduce a rotation system for mission pools and mutators in Havoc challenges, ensuring variety across play sessions. With the Nightmares &amp; Visions update, players will have their ranks reset to the nearest threshold based on the highest rank reached since the introduction of Havoc last year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New challenges -</strong> Fresh horrors are joining the fray with four new mutators added to Havoc:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Heinous Rituals -</strong> Heretics attempt to summon a new kind of Daemonhost, disrupt their rituals, or face the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>The Encroaching Garden -</strong> Specific enemies will heal their allies. If not promptly defeated, they will rapidly regenerate the ranks of the heretics.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Rampaging Enemies -</strong> Fallen enemies empower their allies with a surge of strength, making tactical planning crucial to avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Enraging Elites -</strong> Injured Elites will become enraged, increasing their attack and movement speed and giving them immunity to crowd control effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Time-Limited Special Event “A Day At The Theatre” -</strong> Following the release of Nightmares &amp; Visions, Warhammer 40K Darktide will be hosting a special event focusing on playing Mortis Trials, taking place in the theatre of the mind of the ship’s Psyker.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ogryn Talent Tree Rework -</strong> The Ogryn class is getting a Talent Tree overhaul, providing players with increased build opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn talent tree has been revamped to expand viable melee builds, introduce stronger tank and support options, and improve ranged combat effectiveness. Melee builds are no longer locked into heavy attacks, with new talents supporting both light and heavy strikes. Tank-focused players now have more tools to define their play style, while ranged builds benefit from a reworked Burst Limiter Override, allowing for stronger explosive and sustained fire builds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn's movement and survivability have also been improved. Dodge now staggers enemies, and new passives enhance damage resistance and coherency Toughness regeneration. Additional talents allow for hybrid play styles, rewarding players who mix melee and ranged combat. Overall, this rework aims to increase flexibility, making the Ogryn class feel more impactful and adaptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, any big patch wouldn't be worth its salt if it didn't also bring a slew of balancing changes. You can read the full changelog for Warhammer 40K Darktide - Nightmares and Visions here.
