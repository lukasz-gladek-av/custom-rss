            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have yet again managed to pull off something remarkable. You know how creating patches to ensure two mods work together smoothly's long been something that requires firing up the likes of the creation kit or xEdit? Well, thanks to a new mod dubbed the in-game patcher, it's possible to resolve issues like that simply by wandering up to the location as the Dragonborn and editing the very make-up of the world.</p>
<p>See a rock clipping through a house because you've downloaded a couple of works that give the same bit of Whiterun a makeover? Just mosey over, grab the misbehaving mineral, and either move it elsewhere or delete it. You'll have make sure you've not messed up anything else in the process before you save your changes, but assuming all the NPCs still have their own heads, you've got your own patch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder behind this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158681?tab=description">in-game patcher</a> is RavenKZP, whose previous projects include some equally advanced stuff. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101364">Adding seasons</a> to the new areas added to the RPG by the likes of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and a mechanic that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113658">makes food go mouldy</a> if you keep it in your pockets too long. They've also made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125890">a quest</a> involving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>'s Uncle Sweetshare, which earns them a million extra points in my book.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of me curiously nerding out. This in-game patcher, originally spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/skyrim-mod-conflict-fix-in-game-patche-nexus-mods/">TheGamer</a>, is a plugin for Skyrim: Special edition's script extender. Once it's installed, you enter and exit a patching mode by opening and closing the game's console, where you typically enter the likes of spawn commands.</p><p>Once open, you select objects as you usually would in the console, and can move, rotate, scale, or remove them as you see fit. Markers, such as spawn points and those which control the likes of idles, furniture interactions, and which way water flows can also be manipulated in the same fashion. You can also add keywords to items if you're so inclined. There are a bunch of quick YouTube tutorials under the mod page's video tab to help you get started.</p>

<p>RavenKZP wrote that their creation can also be used simply to rejig the world clutter to your liking or do a bit of redecorating of houses, cities and the like, which'll probably be what I try first if I give it a whirl. Once you've made your tweaks, they can be saved as "BOS/KID patches so they persist across game sessions" and shared with others in ini file form. The modder's also got plans to keep expanding what their work can do going forwards, including adding the ability to edit multiple objects at once.</p>
<p>As you might imagine given what it pulls off, the in-game patcher does come with a pretty chunky list of requirements - the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379">Skyrim script extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444">Address Library for SKSE Plugins</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123664">Object Manipulation Overhaul</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352">SKSE Menu Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148703">SkyPrompt</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805">Base Object Swapper</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136456">Debug Menu</a>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13090">Jaxonz Positioner Converter Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250">More Informative Console</a> are optional extras.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2, the sequel to the roguelike deck-building game that spawned a genre, has been delayed. Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, it said, but has now realigned for March 2026.</p>
<p>We don't know the date but we do, bizarrely, know the day. Mega Crit has already, quirkily, announced that Slay the Spire 2 will be released on a Thursday. According to my calendar, which I presume is the same as yours, it means Slay the Spire 2 will be released on either the 5th, 12th, 19th or 26th March 2026. Maybe provisionally book-off all these days from work?</p>
<p>"We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear," Mega Crit wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">a Steam update</a>. "There's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Mega Crit added, in a lighthearted delay FAQ accompanying the news, that the delay wasn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>'s fault, despite appearances. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong's date was announced," the studio said. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1, but upon closer inspection has some notable differences - evolutions, it's probably fairer to say. A lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game - with what appear to be 3D models in 2D environments now - and there's also apparently a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>One major change outlined in the post is alternate acts. These allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events and bosses. The two examples shared in the update were Act 1a variation Overgrowth, a lush jungle-themed alteration; and Act 1b, the Underdocks, a miry waterway.</p>

One of the clear highlights has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/noble-fokus-apollo-headset-review-astounding-audio-with-an-astounding-pricepoint-to-match/">Noble’s Fokus Apollo</a>, one of the best-sounding pairs of headphones I’ve ever put on my head. Their latest, the Noble Fokus Amadeus, have a certain weight of expectation behind them then, and I had to wonder whether they could repeat the same trick with a pair of wireless earbuds. The answer is an emphatic ‘yes’, though, as with their other offerings, this sits well towards the premium end of the market.</p>

<p>In the box, you’re getting the Fokus Amadeus earbuds, a 42-hour charging case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable and a selection of eartips. On first impressions, the Fokus Amadeus are certainly eye-catching, with the bright red jewel-like design of each earbud an immediate visual highlight, and one which ensures that they’re not going to be mistaken for one of those boring bland earbuds everyone else is wearing. Everything feels like an event with the Amadeus, and every visual detail has been covered, right down to the Noble logo on the tiny metal speaker grilles.</p>


<p>Detaching the foam tips, it’s apparent that they’re a slight touch heavier and more substantial than some wireless earbuds you might own, though they’re only a spot larger than Sony’s WF-1000XM5, and smaller than the older XM4s. They feel rock solid, and the design and build quality reflect the premium price point.</p>
<p>The red jewel design is mirrored by the metal lid of the case, but this feels thin and lightweight in comparison to the earbuds themselves. It doesn’t scream quality, though the rest of the case is solid enough, but it’s a chunky thing to drop into your pocket, being considerably thicker than the case for the AirPods Pro 2 and the elongated case for the Bose Sport Earbuds that I also carry around with me – you might think I have too many earbuds considering I only have two ears, but I would disagree. It’s not huge – we’re not talking anything like the enormous Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 case – but it’ll definitely put a lump in your pocket. I took to chucking them in my bag.</p>


<p>The Fokus Amadeus is equipped with Bluetooth 5.4 and Active Noise Cancellation, boasting a battery life of 8 hours with it enabled, and 12 without. That’s right around the ballpark of other premium wireless earbuds, such as the newly announced AirPods Pro 3 or the Sony WF-1000XM5. It’s going to last you a whole day at work then, and with the 42hrs of charge from the case they’re a solid companion that’s unlikely to let you down when you’re ready to block out the world.</p>
<p>There’s a set of six different ear tips, with three standard tips, and three with dual fins for a tighter fit. The Fokus Amadeus need a twist into your ear to sit properly, and while I had no problem at all with the fit in my right ear, I had to test a few different tips to get my left ear to feel as solid as its partner. In the end, and in a first for me, I used a smaller eartip in one ear over the other, before finally opting for the largest pair of dual tips. It’s well worth taking the time to find the best ones, because the Fokus Amadeus reward you for your perseverance, but this is a pair of earbuds with a particularly pernickety fit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the touch controls aren’t as fussy, and while I do prefer swiping for volume rather than repeated taps, I soon got used to using the left earbud for volume and toggling ANC while the right looks after your music controls and Siri/Gemini. The most impressive thing is that they all work relatively reliably.</p>
<p>The accompanying Noble Fokus app includes Audio presonalisation, which means you get a hearing test before it provides you with a bespoke EQ setting for your ears. I have to say, I didn’t particularly like the curve it gave me for the lower frequencies, but the top end was definitely improved by its tinkering. You can, of course, completely override whatever it suggests, and though there’s a disappointingly slim selection of genre-specific EQs, you can completely customise the EQ so that it fits exactly where you want it to, with both a 10-band option, and an easy-to-parse three-point one.</p>
<p>The Fokus Amadeus is capable of dealing with most modern Bluetooth codecs, including two of the highest bitrate offerings we currently have access to – if your device supports them. I was interested to discover that my new Honor Magic V5 defaulted to using AptX Adaptive at first, before then more commonly connecting via LDAC.&nbsp;Both of these offer high-bitrate connections, and while you might find more detail with LDAC, AptX Adaptive offers lower latency, which might suit you if you’re going to do a spot of mobile gaming along the way. If you’re an Apple user, you’re going to be stuck to AAC or SBC, so you won’t be getting the best out of them at all.</p>

<p>With lossless audio, the Fokus Amadeus sound stunning. The amount of detail their custom-made triple-layer diaphragm drivers are capable of reproducing will make you wonder just how much you’ve been missing listening to music elsewhere.</p>
<p>While I did eventually check out Falco’s Rock Me Amadeus sounded with these earbuds – you’d have to, wouldn’t you? – it fell to my current heavy rotation track, Specter by Bad Omens, to really put the Amadeus through its paces. This soaring slab of emotional metal opens with plaintive piano and a host of reverb that the Fokus Amadeus picks through with care, creating an enveloping soundscape that brings Noah Sebastien’s vocals to the fore, grasping every nuance of this melancholy opening before ripping it apart with chugging guitars and heavy beats. If you’ve got the fit right, I love the rounded and well-balanced bass delivery here, but it’s almost too easy for an earbud to slip out of that sweet spot. My most enjoyable listening sessions with the Fokus Amadeus were static, at home.</p>
<p>I’ve got a full playlist of songs I like to use to review headphones and headsets, and after playing some Death Stranding 2, I’ve found myself drawn back to the music from the first game. That means that Don’t Be So Serious by Low Roar stood out as one I had to try out with the Fokus Amadeus, and its multiple instrumentation types and multi-layered soundscape were an ideal fit. The earbuds’ wide soundstage made it feel as though there was plenty of room for each different instrument, and the precision of the Fokus Amadeus meant you could pick out and focus on each part, even in a busy environment. Seriously, there were elements of this song I’d never heard before that the Amadeus brought out.</p>
<p>It’s all aided by the inclusion of active noise cancellation. It does a good job of removing background sounds from your listening experience, even if it’s not quite as powerful as the ANC you’ll find in Sony and Bose’s top-tier audio products. A recent train journey was ably dimmed, allowing the music and the odd episode of Kaiju No.8 to shine through, while walking around town with an audiobook cranked up proved that the Amadeus was capable of more than just delivering excellent audio.</p>
<p>At $320/£279.99, the Fokus Amadeus are putting themselves right amongst the world’s priciest earbuds, and in terms of audio and build quality they absolutely deserve to be there. However, their fit remained idiosyncratic throughout my time with them, something which I’ve never struggled with while using the Sony WF-1000XM5s and AirPods Pro 2s. If you’re looking for the best ANC though, then you’re going to want the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, which tune out the world to an incredible degree.</p>

            <p>Gearbox and Take-Two Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched to cries of "pretty good" from (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">some</a>) professional reviewers, and "Stutterland bugfest" from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash">a vocal portion of the Steam playerbase</a>. In amongst the complaints about performance, there are some fears about potential breaches of player privacy supposedly allowed for by Take-Two's terms of service. A Borderlands developer has now responded to these fears in the Steam forums, reiterating that Take-Two at large aren't in the business of "spyware".
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Take-Two does not use spyware in its games," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/">the statement on Steam</a>. "Take-Two's Privacy Policy applies to all labels, studios, games, and services across all media and platform types such as console, PC, mobile app, and website. The Privacy Policy identifies the data activities that may be collected but this does not mean that every example is collected in each game or service.
</p>
<p>"Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations," it goes on. "Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience."</p>
<p>The statement gives a couple of examples of more innocuous data collection, such as sponging up player and device identifiers to ensure compatibility with platforms, or making usernames visible to other players, together with more ambiguous practices like gathering data "to better understand how players play games".
</p><p>The statement also seeks to clarify Take-Two's policy towards mods, noting that they "prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to", but do not "generally" take action against mods "that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties." I'm not that familiar with the Borderlands modding scene, but Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somebody-recreated-all-of-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-gta-5-aaaaand-its-gone">have a legendarily iffy relationship with GTA modders</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">Perignon Champagne Gamer</a>, the concern about Take-Two spyware dates back at least to May this year, when a Youtuber video about <a href="https://www.take2games.com/privacy/en-US/">the publisher's recently revised TOS</a> sparked a short-lived uproar.</p>
<p>I do not want to hand over any of my data to any particular large corporation, myself, but I have to say, I don't see anything in that TOS that strikes me as out of the ordinary, for better and worse. Suspicion is the appropriate response to such things, but exaggeration helps nobody. I've read a few comments that assume that Take-Two are automatically hoovering up everything mentioned in the list of possible data types collected, the second you boot up a game, rather than when you deliberately opt into certain services, such as Borderlands 4's irritating SHiFT service for cross-play.</p>
<p>I am adding "interview somebody to do a proper explainer about data collection practices and privacy" to our endlessly extendable, usefully hypothetical Long Term Features trello. While we're at it, we could look into related anxieties about anti-cheat and DRM, which have recently resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call Of Duty and Battlefield requiring that you enable secure boot on PC</a>.</p><p>The TOS aside, some Borderlands 4 players are concerned about the game's usage of two types of digital rights management - the infamous Denuvo software, which has been cited by a few of the reviews that mention launch performance problems, with proprietary Symbiote software stacked on top. We interviewed a Denuvo executive last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/denuvo-respond-to-their-rep-for-tanking-games-im-a-gamer-myself-and-therefore-i-know-what-im-talking-about">about their reputation for tanking games</a>.

Movie sequel</a> — and potentially reveal its title. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple registrations by NBC Universal have been made that reference <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, such as supermariogalaxy.movie, the French supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and the Spanish supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com. All three were registered on September 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beloved Wii platformer originally launched on Wii and featured a storyline that introduced space princess Rosalina, and sparked questions over Princess Peach's original heritage — something that is very briefly also nodded to in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, will the currently-untitled Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel also be named Super Mario Galaxy?

Earlier this year, an image featuring "The Super Mario Galaxy Movie"-emblazoned cans of Old Spice deoderant appeared on the internet, sparking discussion over its authenticity. Several Mario-themed trademarks linked to the image were also purportedly found via the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, fans said, including "Space Mischief," "Cosmic Quest," and "Brooklyn Bounce,"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, fans remarked on the fact that the cans appeared to include previously-unseen artwork of Luigi and Yoshi, though the leak could not be fully verified. Time will tell if it ends up matching with whatever Universal has decided will be the movie's final name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and Universal's Super Mario Bros.

However, the game launched to ‘mostly negative’ Steam reviews over performance issues and crashing, before recovering overnight to ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terrible optimization. Another Unreal Engine 5 casualty. Not worth buying in its current state unless you have a NASA PC,” said one person in a negative review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terrible, terrible performance.

Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox went on to show the “Optimal Settings” charts provided by Nvidia with suggestions for which graphics settings may work best for your combination of GPU and desired display resolution.

Ahead of launch, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford had said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-day-1-patch-does-a-lot-randy-pitchford-says-but-dont-expect-miracles-from-older-pc-hardware">the Borderlands 4 Day 1 patch “does a lot,”</a> amid concern about the performance of the looter shooter. Pitchford had responded to concern about Borderlands 4’s pre-release performance on PC from some users on X / Twitter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the Day 1 patch, playing Borderlands 4 on older hardware won't miraculously unlock "buttery smooth performance," Pitchford added. It should be expected that Borderlands 4 is “unplayable” if you’re trying to use a PC below min-spec, he said, and, generally, playing new AAA games on older hardware won't achieve impressive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Pitchford's comment in full:</p><blockquote>The Day 1 patch does a lot! That said, the expectation for using a below min-spec machine should be that the game is unplayable. That the game runs at all on your system is a miracle. That you can get 55 - 60 fps out of heavy combat is actually incredible given how the engine and what's going on under the hood. Your specification doesn't indicate if you're on SDD or HDD, but that could also explain some of the hitching. It's a big, bold, new, seamless world and I'm sorry to say that older hardware may not provide buttery smooth performance for the latest gen AAA games, as has always been the case since the dawn of PC gaming.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, here are Borderlands 4’s PC specs:</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Borderlands 4 System Requirements:</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Minimum:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann has discussed his decision to step away from the TV adapation of The Last of Us for the third season, stating he'd accomplished his "crazy goal" of elevating video games.
</p>
<p>
While he's now returned to full-time video game development on the forthcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us at a "very high level" to make sure it's "as deeply faithful as Season One was".
</p>
<p>
"I feel like that is the gold standard for this kind of adaptation, while enjoying all these beautiful expansions that happen naturally with the rest of the team and how they're working on Season Three," Druckmann told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">Variety</a>. "So that is where my involvement will stay is at that very, very high level."

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Druckmann announced his decision to step back from the TV show</a> in July, though told Variety he made the decision when the writers' room for Season Three was about to commence. 
</p>
<p>
"I looked at what's in front of me, what would the next season might look like," he said, "and with all the various Last of Us things I'm working on - not just the show - with all the various games I'm working on, the biggest one that takes up most of my time is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, our next big IP for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, it felt like I could better serve all of my responsibilities if I stayed at a higher level."
</p>
<p>
This was also having achieved a goal of elevating The Last of Us beyond players of the game.
</p>
<p>
"I felt like that story could find a bigger audience for people that will never play video games," said Druckmann. "I wanted to elevate Naughty Dog, and PlayStation has been a home for me for 21 years now, and it's given me all the support to tell these wonderful stories, and I wanted to elevate video games. It was such a crazy goal, but I wanted someone to watch this show and have no idea it was based on the video game, and then be like, 'Wait, that's based on a video game?'"
</p>
<p>
Druckmann added he's learned a lot from his time on the show, "even just as far as the craft of making cinematic storytelling".
</p>
<p>
"There's so much that overlaps with my work at Naughty Dog that I felt like I took quite a bit away from that," he said. "I think I could better serve this show and other adaptations like it in the future, having learned all this stuff - but my first responsibility, my first love, is video games, and it's at Naughty Dog."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-expensive-game-says-neil-druckmann">Intergalactic would be the studio's most ambitious game to date</a>.

<p>"decades of prior art" may give developers the upper hand</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Palworld" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca7b62b0f4aed/palworld.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pocketpair</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's recent legal activity has caused quite the commotion online. One patent application relating to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">summoning of a so-called 'sub character'</a> has proven particularly controversial following its swift approval, with the broad nature of its contents having potentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendos-patent-on-sub-characters-could-have-some-dire-ramifications">wide ramifications</a> on the games industry.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Eurogamer</a>, Don McGowan, former Chief Legal Officer for The Pokémon Company, believes that the patent will likely just be ignored. His belief is that because there are countless examples of existing games utilising a summoning mechanic, Nintendo's patent simply won't hold up in court should it choose to launch an infringement lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art.</p>
<p>"This isn't Bandai Namco with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/12/youll_now_be_able_to_play_mini-games_during_loading_times">loading screen patent</a>".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg reckons that the mere existence of the patent may simply be enough to dissuade developers from implementing a summoning mechanic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The filing for such patent protection indicates that Nintendo does intend to pursue a legal strategy in defending itself against entrants in the pocket monster genre. But that strategy may or may not involve lawsuits, as the 'muddying of the waters' effected by the patents existence may be enough to deter investment in and creation of competitors. That is, if Nintendo looks like it could pounce, that may be enough. No actual pouncing required."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's a complex situation, then. It's admittedly tricky to really parse the language in the patent itself, but some of its descriptions and flowcharts do make specific mention of a 'ball' when summoning a sub character. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps developers don't need to fear a potential lawsuit so long as they refrain from implementing a 'Pokéball-inspired' feature.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if there are any tangible ramifications from Nintendo's patent, but it seems that Nintendo is utterly determined to win its case against Pocketpair and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>.</p>

            <p>You're gonna have to wait a bit longer to murder the steeple for a second time, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-ii">Slay The Spire II</a>'s early access release having just been delayed until March next year. Developers Mega Crit have at least cushioned the blow by revealing the day of the week it'll arrive. A Thursday. Which Thursday? The cheeky folks won't say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After a lot of internal discussion, we've made the call to move Slay the Spire 2's Early Access launch to a secret Thursday in March 2026," Mega Crit wrote in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829?l=english">September newsletter on Steam</a>. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!) Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time."</p>
<p>"There's no single dramatic reason," they added. "Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Thus follows a brief Q&amp;A section in which the studio ruled out some theories about the delay folks might have had, such as it being yet another product of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s launch gobbling up a huge amount of attention. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong’s date was announced," Mega Crit community manager Demi wrote. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>They did acknowledge that adding a lot more new stuff to the formula established by the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> is part of the impetus for the change, but made clear this sequel shouldn't become a game that gets "repeatedly delayed with no explanation". "For one thing, you should never expect radio silence from us," Mega Crit explained. "That’s why we’re here talking to you now. And, as opposed to a general release year, we have an actual specific date that we’re aiming for internally and are confident we can hit this time."</p>
<p>With that out of the way, the devs teased another of Slay the Spire 2's new features, alternate acts. Basically, once you unlock it, when you enter a new act over the course of your run you can trigger a choice between two paths with different environs and foes. The example given is one route offering "a lush, tangled ruin with much of its fauna resembling mystical woodland creatures and sentient flora that might just eat you alive", while the other's "a miry waterway connected to the Spire's sewer system, from which all manner of mutant sea creatures and vagrants might emerge".</p>
<p>The game won't launch with all of the planned alternate acts in place, with some set to arrive down the line as part of early access updates.</p>
<p>If you've not given the original Slay the Spire a go, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review">RPS founderperson Alec Meer's review</a> of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikey</a> deckbuilding. The strapline reads "a miracle of design", so I think it's fair to assume his thumb was pointed skywards.</p>

                <p>Since its release in 2020, there have been a number of small DLC releases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3-review-pass-the-duchy/1900-6417551/" data-ref-id="1900-6417551">Crusader Kings 3</a>. But few have inspired the overwhelmingly bad word of mouth that the recently dropped Coronations has received on Steam. Players aren't just disappointed in this release, they're angry as well. Now, PDS Black QA Manager has come forward to apologize to players and accept the blame for the DLC's broken state.</p><p>The QA Manager, Riad, shared his message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> alongside update 1.17.0.1, which is meant to fix some of the players' complaints. Coronations added the ability for players to have their rulers crowned in an official ceremony, and introduced oaths made to the people of their kingdom. However, many of the oaths are either incredibly difficult to achieve, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game simply didn't register them as complete</a>. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews for Coronations have been merciless</a>, and the response is currently marked as "overwhelmingly negative."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFLHnwXwouE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFLHnwXwouE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm sorry," wrote Riad. "Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that's on me. As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn't give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p><p>Riad went on to explain that most of Paradox's resources are going towards a massive Crusader Kings 3 expansion called All Under Heaven. That left Coronations with fewer resources and ultimately led to it launching with the oath mechanics broken, which Riad attributed to "last minute" changes. He reiterated a desire to do better for fans while earning their trust back.</p><p>Steam user Mewzle wrote a direct response to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974947850/recommended/3315520/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riad</a>, noting that they had purchased every previous DLC for the game and given the developer the benefit of the doubt. Mewzle was emphatic about no longer feeling that way for Paradox.</p><p>"If you really feel this way Paradox, then integrate this garbage into the main game, and STOP producing garbage like this that alienates your player base.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s forthcoming sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is the company's "most ambitious game we've ever made".</p>
<p>That's according to creator Neil Druckmann, who spoke to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">Variety</a> ahead of the Emmys this week - for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">The Last of Us won an award</a>.</p>
<p>"I can tell you we're in the thick of it," said Druckmann on the game's development status. "We're making it, we're playing it. We're firing on all cylinders. I've said this before, but I really mean it, I'm really feeling it right now: It's the most ambitious game we've ever made. It's the most expansive game we've ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p>

<p>Druckmann added he's "antsy to show it and talk about it because the trailer that we showed doesn't even scratch the surface of what this game actually is", but don't expect anything just yet.</p>
<p>While he wouldn't go into detail on gameplay, Druckmann explained it continues the studio's trajectory from Uncharted to The Last of Us, creating a realistic action game with emotional storytelling and then adding RPG elements and "wide linear layouts" - but now with sci-fi and even more ambition.</p><p>What's more, Intergalactic may also receive some form of adaptation in the future like The Last of Us. Naughty Dog has already been approached by studios based solely on the initial trailer, but Druckmann doesn't want to "put the cart in front of the horse".</p>
<p>"This needs to be a fantastic video game first, and then if that happens and we have the right partnership, those opportunities would be great," he said.</p>
<p>"But that's not why we do what we do. So there's a lot of ideas of what we could do with Intergalactic, and in some ways it's easier to expand that because it's just how that story is structured in that universe. So there's some interesting conversations happening about potential projects that could come down in the future, but our priority right now is to make Intergalactic the next big, fantastic Naughty Dog game."</p>
<p>Could a sequel to Intergalactic also be on the cards straight after its development?</p>
<p>"I'm sure if Intergalactic is successful, you will see it again," he said. "Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can't say, and I leave that door open."</p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a> (trailer above), with Tati Gabrielle in the lead role.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-working-on-second-game-alongside-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-confirms">Druckmann confirmed the studio has a second game in development</a> too.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has only been out for a little over a week, and this sequel is putting up some crazy numbers. Silksong <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">pulled in five million players in just a few days</a>, and that's without any mobile options. There isn't an official mobile port of Silksong yet, but there is a way you can play your Steam cloud saves on your Android phone.</p><p>As seen on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, GameSir's newly released GameHub version 5.0 emulates Windows so well that Silksong is playable on Android phones. As alluded above, players can access their saved games from Steam and essentially pick up where they left off at home.</p><p>There are some drawbacks to using GameHub to continue your Silksong adventures. For one thing, it's not currently possible to make a save on GameHub that can be uploaded to Steam. That's an issue GameSir is currently trying to solve. Silksong also proved to be very taxing on Android, and it achieved the best results when attached to a cooling plate and fan that allowed the game to hit 100 fps.</p><p>Silksong isn't the only game that can be played through GameHub, but The Verge notes that other titles have had some issues with version 5.0. In the meantime, a group that previously ported Hollow Knight to Android is already making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nd76gs/hollow_knight_silksong_is_getting_a_port_to/#lightbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an unofficial Android port for Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The team hopes to have that port ready to go in a month.</p><p>Over 7% of active Steam users reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-pc-players-are-locked-the-hell-in/1100-6534663/" data-ref-id="1100-6534663">played Silksong on its release date</a>, September 4. For the same day, it hit No. 3 on Steam behind only Helldivers II and Counter-Strike 2. Steam's full rankings for the first week of September will be released on September 15, and then we'll know if Silksong managed to reach top position.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

Their actions will determine how quickly the players' faction is able to expand the reach of their territory at the expense of their rivals. Players will be able to control four factions during the game's early access period, with two more factions to follow when the game gets its full release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/endless-legend-2-demo-out-now-for-one-week-only/1100-6533832/" data-ref-id="1100-6533832">demo for Endless Legend 2</a> was available for a few days in August, but only two of the factions were playable at that time. It was described as a "limited" version of the final game, and featured two cataclysmic tidefalls that reshape the world, as well as 15 minor factions to encounter, and the opportunity to face the Necrophage, a monstrous insectoid-like people who can infect other races with their plague to transform them into one of their own.</p><p>Endless Legend 2's early access release will begin on September 22.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <p>It's Friday, 12th September and we're back with another day of video games goings-on. It'll all be sucked in here, through the flexi-nozzle vacuum of the liveblog, where we can ponder what it all means. What does it all mean?</p>
<p>And note: we will be doing a separate liveblog later to cover today's Nintendo Direct, which starts at 2pm UK time and runs for an hour. This blog will be superseded by that one.</p>
<p>Today's coffee question: What have you played this year that surprised you? I'll start; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. It was released last year in February and reviewed well but sunk like a stone in the ocean amidst everything else going on. It's on subscription services at the moment I believe, and it's well worth a look. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmAX6XFQsA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the full leaked specs of the upcoming PlayStation 6 (PS6) console, and they're even stronger than those in the previous reports. Perhaps the single most impressive spec is the ray tracing one; in August, MLID <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> a 5-10x uplift from the ray tracing performance of the base PlayStation 5 console. Now, though, he is expecting an even greater 6-12x leap.</p>



<p>The range is obviously significant, but if we took that to mean 12x, it would place the PS6's ray tracing performance around the level of the current top-of-the-line graphics card from NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 5090, thus allowing even real-time path tracing in games. Needless to say, it would be a huge surprise, both for a console and for AMD, which is still trailing behind NVIDIA when it comes to ray tracing performance. Granted, there have been rumors from reliable leaker Kepler_L2 that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-udna-architecture-radeon-gpus-playstation-xbox-20-percent-faster-raster-2x-raytracing-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next-gen AMD architecture will focus mostly on improving ray tracing (and AI) performance</a>. In contrast, PS6 rasterization performance wouldn't see nearly as much of a boost, according to MLID, who estimates an improvement between 2.5x and 3x compared to PS5. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 APU is reportedly going to be a monolithic 280 mm² die manufactured on TSMC's 3nm process, leading to lower power consumption (estimated to be 160W TDP) compared to the PlayStation 5 Pro that launched last year. The CPU would be powered by 8 Zen 6C cores (7 of which would be fully enabled, while the other is for redundancy) plus 2 Zen 6 low-power cores dedicated to system tasks, while the GPU would be equipped with 54 RDNA 5 Compute Units (although MLID believes two will likely be disabled), clocked between 2.6 and 3 GHz with 10 MB of L2 cache. The PS6 would therefore offer between 34 and 40 TFlops; for comparison, the PS5 and PS5 Pro are known to be 10.28 TFlops and 16.7 TFlops, respectively. As a reminder, the PS4 only had 1.84 TFlops, so in that regard, the PS5 offered a much greater spec improvement. It should be noted that TFlops are a rather outdated way to estimate a system's power, though.</p>



<p>Rounding up these rumored PlayStation 6 specs, MLID says the memory will feature a 160-bit bus with GDDR7 memory at 640 GB/s bandwidth, supporting up to 40 GB RAM. Sony could choose either 30GB or 40GB RAM, depending on pricing. The report adds that manufacturing should start in the middle of 2027 for a Fall 2027 launch window, which is a little earlier than we expected. Backward compatibility should be maintained with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 games. </p>



<p>MLID's video also touches on Xbox Magnus, the codename of the APU that will power Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console. It is believed to be slightly more powerful (around 25%) but more expensive, both because of the multi-die design and the expected higher power consumption.</p>



<p>If the Fall 2027 launch estimate is correct, we might not have to wait too long to find out if the PS6 specs are indeed accurate. As you might remember, Sony Lead System Architect Mark Cerny started sharing the first tidbits on the upcoming PS5 system in April 2019, around a year and a half before the console's release on November 12, 2020. Should Sony follow the same pattern, we might get official news as early as next Spring.</p>

<p>Could a certain series make a return?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0ffb89a1c456/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary this week, NBCUniversal has apparently registered multiple 'Super Mario Galaxy Movie' domain names.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Direct broadcast is obviously taking place later today, and <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">this recent discovery has now led to speculation</a> about the title and theme of the upcoming movie and even future Mario movies. It seems to have also reignited hopes for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game entries to make a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>At this stage, nothing has been officially announced, so there's no guarantee these newly discovered registrations will lead to any confirmations or reveals.</p>

<p>There are also some theories floating around about this potentially being an <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">attempt to "throw" fans off the trail</a>. In saying this, it's still generating plenty of buzz being so close to Super Mario's anniversary and the latest Direct presentation. Adding some fuel to the fire is a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1966261624622416067">rumoured 'Old Spice' product leak</a> from earlier this year, which featured character renders as well as a title logo for 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie'.</p>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">finding in May on the official NBCUniversal website</a>, which suggested the next Mario Movie (due out in April 2026) would be titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>. However, the same web page removed the reference to this movie title not long after the news began circulating online.</p>
<p>When the follow up Mario Movie was originally announced in March 2024, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at the time how it would be "based on the world of the Super Mario Bros. series".</p>
