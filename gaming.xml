			<p>Black Myth: Wukong has now sold a whopping 10 million copies, in just a matter of three days, reveals developer Game Science in a tweet at X.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is pushing the accelerator when it comes to the popularity of the title amongst fans worldwide since the game has managed to break records, especially in terms of concurrent players. Recently, we reported on how Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/">managed to achieve 2.3 million players on Steam</a>, surpassing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring, and now, according to the developers of the game themselves, Black Myth: Wukong has now achieved 10 million in sales, which is a massive achievement, probably one of for the history books.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the game has achieved three million players across all platforms, including consoles. If we do some maths here, it becomes evident that a gigantic portion of around 2.3 million players is from those on PC, notably Steam, while the rest of 700,000 users are from other platforms. This is mainly due to the hype of the title in China, which is why the PC platform accounts for the larger share of users.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong has sold 10 million copies across all platforms.<br>(Data as of 21:00 Beijing time, August 23, 2024)</p>
<p>Thanks to all players worldwide for your support and love.<br>Have a great gaming weekend!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a> <a href="https://t.co/mp3mk9JxrX">pic.twitter.com/mp3mk9JxrX</a></p>
<p>— Black Myth: Wukong (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While sentiments about Black Myth: Wukong are mixed amongst the audience, it's safe to say that the title has made an impact on the industry, and Game Science, the developer, is now leading the way to becoming an industry giant. Interestingly, we do expect the sales figures to grow moving into the future, given that the game is approaching its first weekend, and in the longer turn, we are anticipating a release on Microsoft's Xbox platform.</p>
<p>For those unaware of why Black Myth: Wukong is such a huge success, the title's rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and unique take on the action RPG formula have attracted the attention of several gamers. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels, not to mention the iconic cutscenes.</p>
<p>The game has received an average <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">Metacritic score</a> of 81, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to. You can look at our review of the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">here</a> as well, where we have delved into the depths of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

Here are the most interesting things we learned about the upcoming expansion.</p><h2 id="h132507"><a id=""></a><strong>Mercenaries are back, baby</strong></h2><p>A fan-favorite feature from past<em> Diablo</em> games is the ability to call upon allies to fight for you. These NPC soldiers for hire were originally introduced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><em>Diablo II</em></a></span>, and <em>Diablo III </em>had its own version of the system with Followers, who were more fleshed-out characters with stories of their own. <em>Diablo 4</em>’s version of mercenaries seems more in line with <em>Diablo 3</em>, as all four summonable allies have names and detailed backstories Blizzard has already revealed.<br></p><p>You’ll unlock the NPC allies during the main quest and summon them in two ways. You can hire one mercenary to be your main companion to follow you around and designate a second mercenary as reinforcement who will emerge during combat to unleash a special skill when you activate a skill of your own. Each mercenary is unique with their own set of skills. There is the drunken archer Subo, the cursed child Aldkin, the berserker crone Varyana, and the shieldbearer Raheir. With a variety of builds to choose from, you’ll be able to form a party that compliments your own character in combat.</p><h2 id="h132508"><a id=""></a><strong>Take on the Dark Citadel with a friend</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-recommend-id="image://c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-recommend-id="image://c6b07e5a0c056295080728ece3acb610" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of fighters attempt to take down a large monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Described by game director Brent Gibson as a “multi-layered dungeon” during Gamescom, the Dark Citadel is a new co-op PvE mode that sounds like a full-blown raid. This is an endgame dungeon meant to test players in (ideally in a full group of four).<br></p><p>The Dark Citadel is three areas long and includes tough-as-nails boss battles featuring unique enemy mechanics. One example given during a <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAD0Py0I-PM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAD0Py0I-PM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a></span> includes gathering a special item to reflect boss attacks in the midst of combat. That item needs to be used once by every team member, so it evokes the traditional MMO raid design of managing boss patterns while also dealing out constant damage.</p><p>There will be a special vendor for the Dark Citadel with some incredible loot to earn if you are up for the challenge. Furthermore, Blizzard is introducing a party-finder that makes grouping up with friends and strangers all the easier. It really sounds like the Dark Citadel will amp up the MMO aspects of <em>Diablo 4</em>, but it’s not the only the only interesting dungeon in <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, as the new time-attack challenge Undercity is also being introduced.</p><h2 id="h132509"><a id=""></a><strong>Nahantu looks stunning (and dangerous)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-recommend-id="image://66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1233" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-recommend-id="image://66b0d9ec33b66c2ab9ce071697fa78ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1233" data-height="691" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure runs through a lush jungle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Vessel of Hatred</em> will take players to the new region of Nahantu, which is the southernmost area of the eastern continent (that’s the setting of <em>Diablo 4 </em>if you didn’t know, because I didn’t). To date it’s the only part of the continent players haven’t visited in <em>Diablo 4</em>—though it was featured in <em>Diablo 2</em>—so there are sure to be some discoveries, new and old.<br></p><p>Within the region are six areas, four of which are jungle-themed and two of which are canyon-themed. But the jungle isn’t well, as an infection has turned it into a dying area full of new enemies called Hollows and Dregs. Both the jungle and canyon areas of Nahantu look to be incredibly layered, with canyons opening into caverns and massive trees letting you walk on the floor or across large branches in the air. </p><hr><p>If you want to dip your toes into <em>Diablo 4</em> ahead of <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>’s release in October, you can try it for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535">free on Steam</a></span> this weekend.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega is asking fans which celebrity cameos they'd like to see in future Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, and the studio has named some interesting ones, such as Keanu Reeves and Jack Black.</p><p>A user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ey18b3/sega_survey_asks_about_yakuzalike_a_dragon_and/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> named JohnConquest shared an email from Sega asking fans which games they've played before or heard of, such as Crazy Taxi and Persona. Then, the email also asks how fans feel about celebrity cameos and if they impact buying decisions.</p><p>At the end of the email, Sega then asks fans to rate some western celebrities and their interest in them if they were to make an appearance in the game. The full list as follows:</p><ul><li>Aidan Gallagher</li><li>Jack Black</li><li>Hiroyuki Sanada</li><li>Lionel Messi</li><li>Xavier Woods</li><li>Hank Azaria</li><li>Danny Trejo</li><li>Minoru Iwasaki</li><li>Rami Malek</li><li>Simone Biles</li><li>Dr. Dre</li><li>Frank Montana</li><li>Robert Pattinson</li><li>Lady Gaga</li><li>Matthew Mercer</li><li>Shohei Ohtani</li><li>Keanu Reeves</li><li>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</li><li>Snoop Dogg</li><li>Ice Cube</li><li>Vin Diesel</li><li>LeBron James</li><li>David Hayter</li><li>Seth Rogen</li><li>Kit Harington</li><li>Mark Hamill</li><li>Eminem</li><li>Ozzy Osbourne</li><li>Billie Eilish</li></ul><p>Of course, this isn't an exhaustive list by any means, and fans have already given some other names they might be interested in, such as Lebron James and Xavier Woods. Others have said that it's more entertaining when developer Ryu Ga Gotoku puts parodies in the series, such as Yakuza 0's parody of Michael Jackson named Miracle Johnson.</p><p>Most notably, Danny Trejo had his likeness and voice in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-the-things-money-cant-buy/1900-6418170/" data-ref-id="1900-6418170">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> as the character Dwight Mendez.

            <p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic, Ubisoft's long-running turn-based strategy series, is returning for an eighth mainline instalment in 2025, just in time to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - which will be the first new core series entry in nearly a decade - serves as a prequel to the entire fantasy saga, exploring its origins across a non-linear campaign as players journey to Jadame, a "mysterious continent in turmoil" that's been mentioned but never explored in previous games.
</p>
<p>
"Traverse a vibrant and living fantasy world full of wonders and dangers," teases Olden Era's announcement, "build magnificent castles, raise
massive armies and clash in epic and highly tactical battles of heroes and mythical creatures."

<p>
Jadame is set to feature unique factions, biomes, and creatures - all presented in a "refreshed visual style that harks back to the vibrant and magical beginnings of the saga" - alongside new combat mechanics, including active abilities for heroes and creatures, a new faction-based perk system, and more.
</p>
<p>
Faction-wise, Ubisoft has so far confirmed Temple (The classic Knights), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Dark Elves and Underground Creatures), and Hive (Insectoids corrupted by Demons), with a sixth to be revealed at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's talk of revamped AI and multiple difficulty levels, three main game modes - solo, co-op, and multiplayer - as well as a random map generator, and even in-game editor tools, enabling players to share their creations.
</p>
<p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is currently set to arrive in "Q2" next year, and it'll initially be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might__Magic_Olden_Era/">available as a Steam early access title</a> on PC, "allowing players and the community to actively participate in the development of the game."

                <p>In preparation for Episode 9, Act II, launching on August 28, Riot Games has announced Vyse--the latest agent to join the Valorant roster. Many of her abilities focus on stunning enemies to get the upper hand.</p><p>Like every other Agent, Vyse will have four primary abilities that she can use. The first is Arc Rose, allowing her to shoot or place down a rose that can blind anyone who goes through it--including teammates. What's nice about this ability is that it can be picked up and redeployed. She also has Shear--a liquid-metal wall that'll activate whenever an enemy crosses it. Once the wall is up, it'll be indestructible for a few seconds, leaving whoever triggered it alone.</p>

Once it's triggered, the vines will become visible, and it will damage and slow down enemies inside it. As for her ultimate, it's called Steel Garden.

                <p dir="ltr">Grand strategy games are a bit too big to demo. Building from a single settlement and a couple of farms into a vast nation is a time-consuming process, and even playing tens of early game turns can only show you so much. Even with that being the case, though, a little time with the opening of 4X game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ara-history-untold/" data-ref-id="5000-566096">Ara: History Untold</a> suggests a sprawling entry into the genre that brings along some new ideas that focus on offering lots of different paths for creating a thriving civilization.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of the massive turn-based strategy game Ara: History Untold at Xbox's Gamescom preview event in Los Angeles. That amounted to about 35 turns--just enough to hit the end of the first era of human history and to get a sense of the way Ara approaches a game about being the most influential civilization on the planet. Like most entries in the genre, there are multiple paths to victory in Ara, like building a conquering military, constructing great works of culture, or amassing a ton of wealth.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ara: History Untold Interview | Xbox Games Showcase Extended 2022</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">What was interesting in those early turns was seeing the ways Ara lets you pick a specific path to victory, focusing your gameplay on what you think is most important.</p><p dir="ltr">That starts with choosing your civilization and its leader, of which there are a lot. Ara includes 36 different leader choices, each of whom has their own special bonuses for their civilization. It's in choosing your leader that you home in on a particular gameplay approach, because each one's unique ability can give you major advantages if you play to their strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">I chose Ghana's leader from the abridged list, who gained additional wealth from focusing on mining in the early game, and seeing as I didn't have much time to play, figured benefits in those initial turns would be for the best. Other leaders' abilities gave them upgrades to specific kinds of units or benefits to population or food production, generally in keeping with what their real-life nations actually excel in.</p><p dir="ltr">Ara gives you some additional micromanagement options, too, allowing you to focus on particular elements of your civilization as you're building it. One of the main ones is a crafting system. Keeping your people happy along a variety of metrics is essential to keep your civilization growing and productive, and you can push those meters up by crafting amenities from different resources. Early on, the amenity my city produced was a feast for its residents, which boosted production throughout the city for 10 turns. Different amenities have different effects, so you can make and use different ones depending on your short-term needs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356291"></a><figcaption>As in most 4X games, you start off small, with the early game mostly concerning scouting, upgrading your village, and finding resource-rich territory to claim.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can also craft other objects that give certain buildings and improvements a leg up. For example, early in the game, scouts you send to explore the world might find caches of resources or tools from past, lost groups of humans. Among the tools, I often found plows I could then assign to my farms, boosting their food production. Much like you might spend money and resources to build specific units, Ara lets you craft items that make changes to the way your civilization functions. It's another way to tune your specific approach to the game, because to craft certain items, you also need to build improvements like a workshop or a forge, and those can have both positive and negative effects on different elements of your nation.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of Ara's gameplay was pretty familiar for 4X and grand strategy games, but with notable twists. Every time my city earned enough research points to unlock a new technology, I was presented with a host of options related to the specific era of human history I was in. These don't function as a tech tree, as these games normally present them, though--instead, you're grabbing a number of options from a list that eventually lead to a specific tech that can kick you into the next technological era.</p><p dir="ltr">Some technologies require earlier ones as prerequisites, but Ara simplifies the entire approach by just giving you a set of technologies and letting you pick the one you want at that moment. It also makes your civilization's development feel a little more organic. Choosing to research grain storage, for instance, gives you big gains in agriculture, but then allows you to unlock fermentation. Developing that technology can let you make alcohol, which increases your people's happiness but lowers their wisdom. However, if you skipped out on the grain storage tech and chose different options, fermentation wouldn't have come up. So you only know about the technologies that are relevant to your path through the game, and have to make moment-to-moment decisions based on your earlier choices, rather than a grand plan devised from knowing what the future will hold.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356292"></a><figcaption>Crafting different items gives you ways to change the focus of your cities and boost the happiness of your people.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you advance, you get additional opportunities to choose specific pathways through the game. Like in other 4X games, you'll sometimes trigger one-time events where you have to make a decision. As I was exploring, I ran into a small tribe not far from my city, which seemed similar to the city-states you can encounter in Civilization.</p><p dir="ltr">As with other major civilizations, Ara tracked my relationship with these folks. Meeting them triggered a one-time event in which the tribe asked for some support in the form of extra food. Trading with them would boost our relationship but cost me resources, while refusing their request had the opposite effect. I picked the diplomatic option, and after a few more turns of good relations, the tribe chose to join my nation instead of remaining independent, giving me an instant boost to population, which triggered an expansion of my territory.</p><p dir="ltr">Upgrading my city with improvements like farms and workshops, plus the expansion in population, also gave me an "expert" unit. Like the craftable items, experts can be assigned to your cities in different roles, allowing you to choose specific benefits. The slots I had available allowed me to either boost food production or the speed of building improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">And finally, after a while, my civilization earned me a Paragon--a notable historic figure. These people are similar to the leaders you can choose from at the beginning of the game, offering specific bonuses to your civilization. You can choose how to use a Paragon, with the option to assign them to different jobs. I assigned mine to help us boost our scientific accomplishments, and that decreased the time for me to research technology. Paragons seem to have their own specific strengths that determine what jobs they can do, but there are also a lot of options for how you can assign them--so as with the crafting system, you can use them to address short-term goals or help push your whole civilization in a specific gameplay direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356294"></a><figcaption>The Act system eliminates civilizations that fail to be memorable to the world, relegating them to the dustbin of history.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the paths you take in what improvements you build, technologies you choose, and units you make, you need to be conscious of keeping your advancements coming. Ara also shakes up the usual 4X gameplay by dividing history into three Acts. The Act system brings what developers call a "battle royale" element to the 4X gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of each Act, all the civilizations in a match are judged on their "prestige," looking at elements like development, expansion, creating great works called Triumphs, and so on. During the transition to the next Act, the bottom half of civilizations are culled from the match--lost to history, essentially, with their civilizations failing to make a mark and becoming forgotten. Those players (or AI-controlled leaders) are eliminated, and at that point, the remaining civilizations can send scouts in to spoil the ruins.</p><p dir="ltr">My time with the demo ended just as I was hitting the Bronze Age, having found a couple other neighboring civilizations but still long before the end of the first Act. According to the score screen, I was only the third-most-prestigious nation, suggesting it might have been about time to get a little more aggressive in my plans. With a focus on quickly expanding to increase the wealth of Ghana, I also hadn't done much in the way of building military units, and I had a potentially aggressive rival civilization not far from my borders, so building up some defenses was probably a rising point on the agenda.</p><p dir="ltr">But with just 35 turns, I only just scratched the surface of what a game of Ara: History Untold would likely entail. It was just enough to get a sense of the many decisions the game adds to the usual 4X cocktail, though--with systems like crafting items, using amenities, and assigning Paragons, there are a lot of small ways you can influence your civilization's trajectory for either long-term planning or short-term needs. I'd like to spend a couple hundred more turns seeing how those choices shake out.</p><p dir="ltr">Ara: History Untold is launching on PC on September 24.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dress-up-jump-up-developer-kentaro-tominaga-shares-gameplay-design-of-infinity-nikki<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With over 100 million players, the Nikki series is a beloved dress-up RPG developed by Infold Games, the overseas label of China’s Papergames. </p><p>An action game with a focus on dressing up may sound like a game for casual players. However, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinity Nikki</a> – the series’ newest installment, coming to PC, PlayStation 5 and mobile – is an open-world game in which platforming action is a key feature. The debut trailer in which main character Nikki traverses a vast open world in a myriad of different outfits surprised fans of the series and newcomers alike.   </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-17-12-48-9588490-1724345682004.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In May, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview">IGN published our impressions after playing a three-hour demo</a>. We were impressed by how fun and unique Infinity Nikki’s open world is. From its approachable controls and satisfying action and combat to its rewarding exploration and crafting systems, it feels great to play. Needless to say, changing into your favorite outfit and visiting interesting locations is an essential part of the experience. This makes Infinity Nikki more than just an exciting adventure in an epic world. It combines a sense of the everyday with the freedom and immersion only a video game can deliver.</p><p>Infinity Nikki has Kentaro Tominaga – who worked on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a game designer – on board as sub-director. We interviewed Tominaga in Kyoto, Japan, where Infold Games recently opened an office, to learn more about his vision for Infinity Nikki.
</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-09-ign-x-tominaga-kentaro-66-1724345848663.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Photo by Alessandro de Bellegarde</figcaption></figure></output></p><p>“I worked together with the development team in Shanghai for about half a year,” explains Tominaga. “By doing so, I was able to get to know them. Now, I am working from our new office in Kyoto while communicating with the team back in Shanghai.”</p><p>Tominaga himself was the first employee of Infold Games' Kyoto office. Now, roughly 10 people work at the office, while Infinity Nikki’s development team as a whole has over 700 members.</p><h2><strong>Exploration and Platforming</strong></h2><p>Upon translating this beloved dress-up game series into an open-world format, Tominaga saw it as his first task to make sure the gameplay would be enjoyable for players with little to no experience with action games.</p><p>“In open-world games, you traverse through a large world, and finding hidden secrets along the way is a big part of the experience,” he says. “I thought that combining platforming with this exploration element would result in a fun new kind of experience.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-19-40-51-1511589-1724346192537.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As Tominaga implies, discovering new points of interest and figuring out how to reach them are an essential part of what make open-world video games so captivating. In Infinity Nikki, the platforming mechanics play a big role in delivering that unique sense of satisfaction.</p><p>By obtaining special clothing called Miracle Outfits, Nikki can acquire a wide array of skills. For example, the Floating Outfit allows her to float with a quick press of the jump button, which makes it possible to stay in the air for a longer time and reach higher locations.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-20-15-11-3571576-1724346357102.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“If you look down at the world from somewhere you reached through platforming traversal, you can find the next place you want to investigate – and once you reach that place, you will find yet another place to explore,” says Tominaga. “We made it so that the exploration and platforming work together naturally to create a flow that keeps the player interested and motivated.”<br>
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-09-ign-x-tominaga-kentaro-57-1724346487534.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Photo by Alessandro de Bellegarde</figcaption></figure></output><p>One of the game’s outfits allows the player to defeat enemies by shooting balls of light. To allow new players to slowly get used to such mechanics, Tominaga instructed the team to focus on the relative height of enemies.</p><p>“When an enemy is flying in the air, the player needs to jump in order to attack from the right height,” he says. “While it might sound obvious, by doing so, the player isn’t just mashing buttons and must react in different ways, which keeps the gameplay from becoming dull.”</p><p>When playing with a controller, the team made sure that jumping and changing the camera angle can be done simultaneously without stress. Infinity Nikki was designed as a unique open world in which the player can explore and make discoveries of their own. At the same time, combat was designed with plenty of knowledge on how to develop an open-world action game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-21-26-09-7829242-1724346953933.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Infinity Nikki is being developed for not just PS5 and PC, but also for iOS and Android. Developing a game that can be played with keyboard and mouse, a controller or a touchscreen was new for Tominaga.</p><p>“Developing a platform game for smartphones was – as I expected – challenging to accomplish, and we are still refining it,” he admits. “We wanted an experience that can be enjoyed in the same way no matter what platform you choose to play on. Since there will likely be a lot of players who haven’t played 3D action games before, we didn’t want the game to be more difficult than necessary. We also aimed for simple controls so that anyone could pick up and play.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-09-ign-x-tominaga-kentaro-17-1724347315989.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Photo by Alessandro de Bellegarde</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Dress Up, Level Up</strong></h2><p>By obtaining outfits with skills, the player will obtain Whimstars in order to upgrade the Heart of Infinity, which functions as a skill tree. Whimstars can be found throughout the open world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-21-35-13-8373834-1724347454094.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“Upgrading the Heart of Infinity allows you to unlock more Miracle Outfits, among other things,” explains Tominaga. “Essentially, it functions as leveling up your character. The player can hunt for more Whimstars throughout the game’s field in between main story events. By implementing elements that reward exploration as well as the platforming mechanics, we created a solid gameplay cycle. The characters and world of the Nikki series are brought to life through these elements. The vast open world offers the opportunity to discover a variety of different scenery, and the player is free to take photos in these environments while wearing their favorite outfits. I always tell the staff that in addition to exploration and platforming, worldbuilding and photo mode function as the four most important aspects of Infinity Nikki.”</p><p>Some Miracle Outfits allow the player to gather different types of crafting materials. A cute fishing outfit allows Nikki to fish at watersides, while an outfit that has Nikki hold a butterfly net makes it possible to catch insects at flowerbeds. The Bye-Bye Dust outfit allows Nikki to brush animals she finds in the game’s towns and grasslands to obtain loose animal fur. The animals love being brushed by Nikki and will grow fond of her after she brushes them. Many beta testers fell in love with this feature, which was originally suggested by Tominaga himself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-21-37-24-8504277-1724347638375.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“When coming up with the idea of gathering material from animals, I realized that skinning them or hunting them for meat was not a good match for Infinity Nikki,” says Tominaga. “Brushing them in return for an item seemed like a better match. It could function as one of the many moments of joy we wanted the game to have.” </p><p>While it was his idea, even Tominaga himself was pleasantly surprised when he first saw how animal brushing was implemented in-game.</p><p>“From dogs to cats and birds, each animal type reacts with its own unique set of animations,” he says. “Dogs, for example, show their bellies in a very cute way. I was amazed to see how much attention our staff put into these animations. For me, too, it was a lot of fun to see how each animal type reacts.” </p><h2><strong>Friends in Fashion</strong></h2><p>Besides exploration and platforming mechanics, Infinity Nikki’s world and characters also play an important role in the game’s appeal. The relationship between Nikki and her cuddly companion Momo is shown in strong yet subtle fashion. When they are suddenly transported to a different dimension at the start of the game, Nikki and Momo crack jokes with each other and work together to overcome obstacles. Nikki and Momo are welcomed by friendly characters in the game’s towns as well. Tominaga says that he and his team put a lot of effort into the game’s characters, especially Nikki and Momo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-19-56-27-2447628-1724347921358.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“Momo is a very important companion to Nikki, so we chose to put a lot of effort into portraying their friendship,” he says. “For example, Momo walks alongside Nikki during the game. Even when Nikki jumps and floats around the game’s world, Momo does his best to follow her. In shops, Momo will sit on a chair and listen to what the shop owner has to say together with Nikki. We always try to portray how Momo is joining Nikki on her endeavors.”</p><p>A lot of effort has been put into how the characters behave in Infinity Nikki’s towns and other locations. Changes in weather and time of day also affect the towns and landscapes.</p><p>“The same location can look drastically different depending on the weather,” says Tominaga. “When it rains, Nikki’s clothes will look wet and items such as a picnic set will be moved so that they don’t get wet. I hope players can notice little details that can only be found at a certain place at a certain moment and take photos when they notice.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-18-11-50-13130722-1724348436355.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Tominaga says new areas will be added to Infinity Nikki after release. Besides the grasslands that we got to play when we previewed the game, there will be areas such as a location covered in snow and a deep forest inhabited by faeries. The variation of locations should make photography even more interesting. During our time with the game, we felt that finding photogenic spots in a vast, everchanging open world proved to be a great match with a dress-up game. Even for a standard open-world game, a deep photo mode is almost seen as essential today. A wide array of camera options and different filters can be enjoyed in Infinity Nikki, and sharing pictures with other players will undoubtedly become an important part of the experience.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/20240817-174800-1724348524062.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We ask Tominaga if Infinity Nikki will provide any methods for players to communicate.</p><p>“Of course it will be possible to upload pictures and share them with other players within the game,” he replies. “Players can also join the world of other players to take pictures together. Players can become friends within the game through photography, and we are definitely thinking about ways for players to communicate. </p><p>“Also, while this might be added a while after the game’s release, we are planning to add a feature that lets players have their own home to which they can invite their friends.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-17-53-52-12052403-1724348617107.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Wear What You Like</strong></h2><p>Styling Challenges are bouts against NPCs to decide who has the best fashion coordination. Styling Challenges have always been a part of the Nikki series, where players combine all sorts of clothes and items to match a certain theme, with the winner being the one who makes the best match. Styling Challenges are present in Infinity Nikki as well.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-16-58-28-8728272-1724348769376.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“Players can have fun gathering coordination items as they play, but we made sure it is not compulsory to advance through the main story,” Tominaga says. “It was important for us to make it something players can enjoy optionally. In a regular open-world game, when players find clothes or armor of high stats, they might end up wearing them throughout the game. For Infinity Nikki, we wanted the player to be able to wear what they want without having to think of the stats of a certain outfit.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-09-ign-x-tominaga-kentaro-161-1724348844581.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Photo by Alessandro de Bellegarde</figcaption></figure></output><p>Even when players want to utilize skills like jumping or brushing, it is not necessary to keep wearing the Miracle Outfits that have those skills. When you press the jump button or choose a certain skill from the skill wheel, Nikki’s outfit will change for that moment. Once Nikki is done using the skill, she will automatically go back to the appearance you chose for her. That means players can have Nikki wear whatever they want without having to worry about gameplay restrictions.</p><p>In earlier stages of development, it was necessary for players to change into different outfits whenever they wanted to use a certain skill.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-19-47-11-1891649-1724348978643.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“When the game started to shape up, all the developers started to do test plays from the beginning to the end of the game,” says Tominaga. “One of them noticed that the amount of time they were wearing the same Miracle Outfits was too long. When it comes to action mechanics and playability, I can sense problems myself, but this staff member was more aware of what they were wearing when playing the game.”</p><p>This example shows that while Tominaga is utilizing his experience to realize his vision for Infinity Nikki, he is open to ideas, proposals and the creativity of other staff members as well. We ask Tominaga what it’s been like working with the staff members of Infold Games for the first time.</p><p>“My first impression was that they are a very young and passionate team,” he says. “Many of them are in their twenties or thirties, and they are very motivated to create fun games. In game development, there is never one correct answer. Everyone on the team has their own vision based on the games they have played or the things that they have experienced in the past. This is reflected in Infinity Nikki, which I think is very exciting.”</p><h2><strong>Moments of Joy</strong></h2><p>Platforming, exploration, a captivating world and fun photography: All the elements that shape the open world of Infinity Nikki were conceived to achieve one overall goal.</p><p>“When joining the team, Runhao Yao (Infold Games’ CEO) told me that the concept for Infinity Nikki was to have players experience moments of joy,” Tominaga says.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/22/2024-08-15-18-18-48-13548844-1724349173448.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Wearing your favorite outfit in a lush green world, engaging with friendly characters, visiting beautiful locations and taking photos are just some of the activities Tominaga and his team crafted to provide those moments of joy. While many of these experiences can be had in other open-world games, Infinity Nikki presents them in a sweet, heartwarming way that lines up with that desire.</p><p>Right now, Tominaga’s main goal is to deliver Infinity Nikki to the players and to expand on that world after release.</p><p>“I want to focus all my energy on Infinity Nikki,” he says. “I hope I can make it a fun game with as many moments of joy as possible.”</p><p>Infold Games’ Kyoto offices were opened because of Infinity Nikki. Through the development of Infinity Nikki, Tominaga’s knowledge is being passed onto many staff members, which will benefit their work on Infinity Nikki and future projects to come.</p><p>Finally, we ask Tominaga what kind of players he hopes will play Infinity Nikki.<br>

                <p dir="ltr">A giant beetle charged toward me, and as it stepped into a big puddle in the center of the room, I snagged it with a burst of magical vines that appeared beneath its feet. Then I blasted the creature with one of my dual flintlock pistols--this one charged with electricity--which sent arcs down through the water, shocking a few skeletons that were joining the fray behind it. As they looked to overwhelm me, I unloaded with both my pistols, zipped a little sideways with a dodge, and clambered away to unload on them before they could slice me up.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the highlights of my hands-on time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming first-person RPG, is its breezy combat and combination of elements. The game has seen some comparison to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, and with a weapon in each hand, it feels on point. Mixing and matching different play styles, like blasting away with elemental pistols, sneaking around with a bow, or dipping into a pocket to pull out explosive jars to chuck into a melee, felt pretty good in my short look at the game. That brief time also highlighted that the options I tried only seem to scratch the surface of what Obsidian is going for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQV5EOhino" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4uQV5EOhino" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Obsidian showed off an hour-long look at Avowed at an Xbox event in Los Angeles that mirrors what is available this week during Gamescom in Cologne, Germany. The preview build picks up early on in the proceedings as you search for a missing expedition from the Aedyran Empire that has entered the islands of the Living Lands, the game's bright and deadly setting. Their path took me--the Aedyran Empire's envoy--into a huge underground cave system, alongside a companion character named Kai.</p><p dir="ltr">As Avowed's trailers have shown, the Envoy's job is to find the cause of a mysterious illness plaguing the Living Lands called the Dream Scourge. Evidence of the sickness, which infects people and animals and can also be seen spreading across the land as a sort of fungus, keeps appearing even deep underground--but what exactly it is or does was a mystery in this early part of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The first thing I thought of when I originally saw Avowed's cover art was Annihilation, both the book by author Jeff VanderMeer and the movie adaptation directed by Alex Garland. Venturing through the demo continues that impression; the demo takes place in a bright, beautiful underground cave, full of plants and flowing water, and interspersed with bioluminescent flora.</p><p dir="ltr">Art director Matt Hansen and production designer Ryan Warden lit up when I mentioned Annihilation during an interview after playing the demo. Hansen said that, of course, everyone working on the game has brought a ton of different inspirations to it, but Annihilation was a big one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356220-avowed_screen_environment1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356220" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356220-avowed_screen_environment1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356220"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356220-avowed_screen_environment1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's a very vibrant world, and that was a very intentional decision on our part, because when you allow yourself access to that, you can explore the full range of color psychology, and, you know, vibrant colors tend to be dangerous. What does that mean if we really play into that?" Hansen said. "And with trying to sell [that] the Living Lands is arguably the most dangerous place in Eora, we went big on color, but that's also an interesting juxtaposition to a lot of really grim story that you're going to encounter over the life of the game."</p><p dir="ltr">In both the book and movie, a strange phenomenon has cordoned off a piece of land that comes to be known as Area X, and an expedition is sent in to study it, with strange and horrific results. To enter the area, the group has to pass through a strange, inexplicable barrier called the Shimmer in the movie.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I really like about that is going back to this concept of duality and light and dark," Warden said. "There's that hesitation right as the group is about to enter the Shimmer in Annihilation. There's that moment where they're all just sort of looking at each other, and you get the sense of, okay, it's almost like nervousness, but also excitement, at going into something that's brand new, but also, I don't know what's lurking behind there. And that's kind of what we've got with the danger of the Living Lands, or certainly something that we've tried to bring out. It's that sense of, if you get an embrace from a loved one, that's a very nice thing. If you get an embrace from a python, that is maybe not as good of a thing. And so, is it an embrace? Is it a stranglehold? And that sort of a little bit of salt with your sugar helps really sell the overall thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is part of the universe of Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity series, but it feels a lot more like the studio's other recent RPG, The Outer Worlds, in how it plays. That's not just because of the first-person perspective that defines both Avowed and The Outer Worlds, as compared to Pillars' isometric viewpoint. Avowed is also faster and more visceral in terms of how it plays. Moving through the cave requires a lot of jumping over gaps and climbing up ledges, and while the game doesn't have a full free-running, Assassin's Creed-like feel, this demo shows off how much verticality and traversal are part of the world design.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356222-avowed_screen_environment2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356222" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356222-avowed_screen_environment2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356222"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356222-avowed_screen_environment2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Working on The Outer Worlds, we started to realize, 'Hey, we can go a lot more vertical with the game,'" art director Matt Hansen told me in an interview. "We can do a lot more with traversal. And that's new for us as a studio; we've not really done that before. And so getting to experiment with that and also encounter pitfalls and figure out, 'Okay, that didn't quite work, what could we do to really make it sing?' And I mean, I didn't really like traversal in The Outer Worlds, I'm gonna be totally honest. It's fine, there's nothing wrong with it, but I didn't feel momentum in the way that I do in Avowed, and that was one of the things that we really want to make sure that we improved upon."</p><p dir="ltr">Momentum is one of the surprising elements of how Avowed feels moment-to-moment, in fact, and it feels like Obsidian has put a premium on movement as part of combat and exploration. There are the running, jumping, and platforming aspects, but you also have a short-range dodge move you can use in combat to avoid taking a hit or to sidestep an enemy. And like a lot of games, Avowed lets you slide from a sprint. Hansen noted that the slide was something that's not strictly necessary as part of combat or movement, but it's fun, so Obsidian put it in--and people playing the game have been excited to discover the ability to slide as they play.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you're an isometric, top-down game, it's pretty slow by comparison, especially when it's real-time with pause, like Pillars was, and so having our gameplay team really dig in hard to what makes those moments fun was an interesting challenge for us," Hansen said. "It's a lot of new territory--like we've had first-person combat in games before, but we really wanted to dig into, 'What do games outside of genre do that work so well, and which of those things can we reasonably pull in?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Delving deeper into the cave, our demo had us spending a lot of time with companion Kai--notably voiced by Brendan Keener, who played Garrus in the Mass Effect games. Kai comments pretty liberally on the proceedings, fleshing out his character and drawing attention to the evidence we find as we make our way deeper into the cave. He notes that there are a lot of signs of life here, and not just those left behind by the expedition. This place is also dangerous, in part because of the xaurips--hostile humanoid lizard people we keep finding along the way. It's also outfitted with traps, several of which caught curious or incautious expeditioners.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356216-avowed_screen_combat_kai_xaurip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356216" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356216-avowed_screen_combat_kai_xaurip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356216"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356216-avowed_screen_combat_kai_xaurip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We eventually stumble across a survivor of those traps and hostile creatures, a kid named Caedmon, who, alongside Kai's commentary, gives a sense of Avowed's tone. Bleeding and maybe dying of his injuries, the first thing Caedmon does is lament that he's going to die a virgin. Obsidian fans will be instantly familiar with what's on offer here, with multiple dialogue options for how you deal with Caedmon, including several that depend on your character, like the stats you've focused on or the backstory you've chosen in character creation.</p><p dir="ltr">You can help Caedmon out, and he gives you information about what happened to the expedition if you do. On the other hand, you can tell him to suck it up and get over his life-threatening injuries, and as was demonstrated by another journalist during our session, Caedmon will actually (and somewhat hilariously) just... die.</p><p dir="ltr">Caedmon directed us to Sargamis, an oracle and worshiper of the god Eothas and, apparently, the guy responsible for the underground temple and the traps. Sargamis has little in the way of information about the expedition, but he sends you on a side quest that dovetails with your search, asking you to retrieve something called the Splinter of Eothas from deeper in the cave. That artifact is possibly what the expedition members were after as they proceeded, and if you bring it back to Sargamis, he'll use it to try to summon and trap Eothas in a big statue. There's a bunch of lore surrounding this whole quest, and one notable element of Avowed is how tooltips will let you pull up short glossary entries alongside dialogue for a quick explanation of what key terms mean, to help you follow along.</p><p dir="ltr">The highlight of the quest with Sargamis is that, if you bring back the splinter and give it to him, he tries to use a series of magical and scientific devices to summon his god and seemingly fails. Then he has a suggestion: <em>You</em> should sacrifice <em>your soul</em> to the statue to draw Eothas into it. The dialogue options give you the chance to do that, if you really want to, but it sounds like a terrible idea. Naturally, as this is an Obsidian game, you can convince Sargamis to use his own soul on the statue instead. While you can warn Sargamis that you don't think this is going to work, he does it anyway, and it goes exactly as expected. So if you make the right choices, that's both characters you meet dying soon after talking to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356225-avowed_screen_sargamis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356225-avowed_screen_sargamis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356225"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356225-avowed_screen_sargamis.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The interactions with Caedmon and Sargamis have their funny moments, but as Hansen and Warden told me, Avowed isn't really a comedic game in the same sense as the satirical The Outer Worlds is. The tone is more in line with Pillars of Eternity--funny at times, and pretty dark at others.</p><p dir="ltr">"[The Pillars of Eternity game] are very much games for adults, but adults also like to have a laugh, right? And so we try to punctuate the serious tone of a lot of things with levity, both in terms of the writing, but also the visual storytelling," Hansen said. "It's definitely not a comedy game, but I think just like in real life, when faced with incredible tragedy and incredible adversity and really challenging situations, people turn to comedy a lot as a defense mechanism, as a release of all of that stress, and we know that that's a powerful component of human psychology. ... It's a game of contrasts, and things feel bigger when they're contrasted against their opposite. Black is blacker if you've just been hit with a bright light. And that's true of narrative tone as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Not far beyond the oracle and his statue, after another big combat encounter with some rather large beetles, you eventually do find the Splinter of Eothas sitting and waiting on an altar--although there's still no sign of expedition. Taking it causes an earthquake to shake the cave like something out of Indiana Jones, followed by a boss fight with a big, barbarian-like skeleton called the Godless Executioner.</p><p dir="ltr">The big guy hits hard with a two-handed sword, requiring you to dodge away to avoid taking a bunch of damage from his hits, but the tough element of this fight is actually in figuring out your priorities. Before long, the Godless Executioner is joined by a bunch of other skeletons, including archers, fighters carrying swords and shields, and a priest who will heal the boss continually during the fight. You can't make any progress until the priest goes down, but fighting the boss is tough while getting sniped by the archers, too. Luckily, Kai is here to help draw the boss's ire while you mop up all the little guys around the room.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356226-avowed_screen_environment3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356226" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356226-avowed_screen_environment3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356226"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356226-avowed_screen_environment3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I played this sequence twice with two different builds. The first time, I did it with the dual-pistol character, which Obsidian helpfully referred to as a "ranger" in the save file, who also sported a bow for stealthy snipes and a spell for going invisible to get out of danger. The second time, I was on the "barbarian" file, wielding a big, two-handed club and doing big damage to the boss with heavy melee attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Obsidian put us into save files with classic RPG character types like ranger and barbarian, Warden said that one of the major elements of Avowed is that it doesn't have traditional character classes. These character builds were created for the sake of these demos to give a sense of the different approaches you can take in the game (there was also a magic-focused character I saw a bit in action but didn't get to play).</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things that's also kind of novel about this game, certainly in comparison to the Pillars games, is the fact that it's a classless game," Warden explained. "You don't jump into character creation [and] press A on 'barbarian.' Here, it's up to you. You can roll around with a sword and board, you could do sword and pistol, you could do wand and pistol. You could do basically any combination that you can come up with."</p><p dir="ltr">Replayability and the ability for players to find different pathways through the game are also major focuses of what Obsidian is going for with Avowed, Warden said. He mentioned that despite playing through the preview build a huge number of times, he often was surprised by the different ways you could take through it. As an example, he mentioned another player who skipped one of the major combat encounters in the demo--the fight with the beetles--by using the invisibility spell to slip by them. Warden said he expected the player would have to deal with that combat encounter on their way back out of the cave. But it turns out, they never had to, because the earthquake triggered by grabbing the Splinter of Eothas floods that cavern, something he hadn't considered. You can even swim down and find all the drowned bugs, he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356227-avowed_screen_environment4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356227" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356227-avowed_screen_environment4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356227"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356227-avowed_screen_environment4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Watching other people run through the demo, it's clear that it is a bit shorter than I realized. You can clear the whole thing in a matter of minutes if you're quick about it and ignore diversions. But I spent an hour on the cavern quest, reading lore, checking corners, and finding side doors and secret locations opened by shooting hidden switches. The demo wasn't long, but it was dense with things to see and do.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Hansen and Warden about Obsidian's approach to Avowed, which isn't quite a full open-world game such as Skyrim--the developers instead are calling it "open zone," with the map made up of several large but discrete areas to explore. Taking that not-quite huge open-world approach, they said, allowed Obsidian to up the density on the content within Avowed, much like in the demo's cave.</p><p dir="ltr">"You may have noticed the game is super dense with visual interest, with things to do, all of that," Hansen said. "The bigger the level is, the harder it is to actually have that density and have it run. And we wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the content and making the content as good as possible, and not have to worry as much about trimming back so much to accommodate a big open world."</p><p dir="ltr">"Our zones are still huge," Warden added. "There are some of them that are absurdly large."</p><p dir="ltr">The demo ended soon after I returned to Sargamis with the Splinter (in fact, the power to game stations went out just before he surrendered his soul to the statue). I still have no idea what happened to the expedition. But delving into notes and books, and talking to the demo's two characters, I got an intriguing look at the expansive depth of the Living Lands. Though my look at the game was brief, it was full of potential, with fun and funny moments and fascinating characters, a ton of deep lore, and a fast, dynamic combat system underpinning it all. Avowed seems to contain all the things that make Obsidian's RPGs deep, fascinating experiences, while taking a major step forward for the studio. Just how big a step it is will become clearer when the game releases in February 2025 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>It seems clear that players are ready for a true competitor to The Sims. While many thought Paradox’s Life By You could be that game, that wasn’t the case as it was ultimately canceled by the studio. But now there’s another potential challenger to the thrown held by The Sims, inZOI.</p>



<p>The game is still in development, but players were given a chance to try out inZOI’s character creator during Gamescom 2024 and it was met with much fanfare from players. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="inZOI’s new trailer has just been unveiled at ONL gamescom 2024! #inzoi #gamescom2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_aQ0zVOhRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At its peak, the character creator alone saw <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3092450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 19,000 concurrent players.</a> And those players definitely were busy. According to developer Krafton, over 100,00 characters, or Zois as they call them, have been created and uploaded to the game’s content platform. It’s also jumped into Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">top 50 wishlisted</a> games.</p>



<p>“We are incredibly thankful for the overwhelming interest in&nbsp;<em>inZOI</em>&nbsp;during our first global demo at gamescom 2024,” inZOI producer and director Hyungjun Kim said. “[We] look forward to your continued support and excitement for the game.”</p>



<p>If <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you want to check out</a> inZOI’s character creator, you have until August 26.</p>



<p>There is no set release date for inZOI. However, when it launches it will first come to PC before expected releases on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/im-in-awe-of-how-hard-this-new-doom-track-goes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, a remastered update to <em>DOOM </em>+ <em>DOOM II</em> came out. Though it lacks some features in many existing source ports of the game, it’s a technical achievement and a marked improvement over the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Classic_Unity_port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a> port. It comes packed with tons of new stuff, but overwhelmingly the best part is <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, the first real <em>DOOM</em> expansion in years. <em>Legacy of Rust</em> is not only a fantastic addition on its own; it also features one of my favorite pieces of game music of all time.</p><p>It is worth briefly going over the mostly good and few rough spots of Nightdive Studios’ work on <em>DOOM </em>+ <em>DOOM II</em>. Done in Nightdive’s <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/KEX_Engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kex engine,</a> the game is better than the previous official release it replaces, particularly for consoles. The new port adds multiplayer and coop support, deathmatch, a fantastic vault, an improved soundtrack thanks to Andrew Hulshult, and improved 4k and 120fps rendering on most modern platforms. Digital Foundry has a fantastic breakdown of this in their technical analysis.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Doom + Doom 2: The Classics Return - But Are Nightdive's Remasters Definitive?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZAmSO5fWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Digital Foundry breaks down how technically impressive this </figcaption></figure></div><p>The port also allows for <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Boom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BOOM</a> and <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MBF21</a> compatible WADs to be played, although you cannot play the YouTube infamous<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wAo54DHDY0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MyHouse.wad</a> or anything else created around GZdoom (in fact, it will crash anything uploaded that relies on GZdoom). This is reasonable, as GZdoom is very complex and basically its own thing at this point. That said, there are some notable issues that need ironing out. Players have noted slight movement differences with the game, but the actual mod section of the game is the part I personally struggled with the most. Aside from being a content free-for-all, allowing players to upload whatever incompatible or problematic content they want without attribution, it’s just a nightmare to sort through. It’s a slightly sloppy part of an otherwise meticulous update, and I hope that it is updated soon.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Legacy of Rust's</em> first stage is pretty predictable, until you hit the portal. Credit: id Software/Nightdive Studios/MachineGames.</figcaption></figure><p>What Nightdive has achieved in this version of <em>DOOM </em>+ <em>DOOM II</em> is massively impressive. But the real star of the show is the newest expansion: <em>Legacy of Rust,</em> a collaboration between id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. It is a synthesis of what the previous <em>DOOM </em>games were and what the <em>DOOM </em>community has made over the decades. It features new weapons and enemies, some of which were pulled from cut content in the original games. Dominic Tarason has a fantastic writeup of it at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-2s-first-true-expansion-since-the-90s-showcases-just-how-much-modding-has-improved-in-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a>. There is a real sense of modernity to the design, a synthesis that is hard to articulate without seeing it in action.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Expanding DOOM + DOOM II with Legacy of Rust | Deep Dive Interview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks64hePUFqg?start=1004&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Xaser explaining the behind the scenes with <em>Legacy of Rust</em>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Though many hands were involved in <em>Legacy of Rust</em>’s creation, it is worth highlighting Xaser Acheron, who spearheaded the project, works at Nightdive, created many of the levels, and wrote <em>Legacy of Rust’s </em>soundtrack<em>. </em>Xaser is a <em>DOOM </em>virtuoso, working on WADs for decades. You only need to <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Xaser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at his extensive output,</a> in particular completely transformative mods like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xoqkKuO9tk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psychic</a>. Nightdive itself has many staffers plucked from the Doomworld forums, but if anyone is going to make an officially-sanctioned <em>DOOM </em>expansion, Xaser is a perfect person to lead it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DOOM: Legacy of Rust OST - The Shores of Heaven (Text Screen &amp; Sanguine Wastes - MAP02)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnwUasopups?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This brings us to the soundtrack. Every song in <em>Legacy of Rust</em> is either appropriate to <em>DOOM</em>, idiosyncratic in its orchestration, or just a stone cold heater. The tracks “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvyCgFqZpWw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tactical Blasphemy</a>,”&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7vaQmlyF1g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cliff Diver</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lGRXgCDRc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March of the Vespers</a>” in particular are all unbelievable bangers. These compositions are among some of my favorites in any <em>DOOM </em>game, beautifully intricate and symphonic. But in the entire soundtrack, the track “The Shores of Heaven,” which plays in the second map “Sanguine Wastes,” takes the cake. I rank it not only equal to the original <em>DOOM </em>soundtrack, but among my favorite chiptune tracks period. It’s in the same tier as the <em>Robocop</em> title theme by <a href="https://youtu.be/RFgXGw_kXpc?si=lkEJGYe9EVRVK1kf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OCEAN Software</a> and demoscene tracks like “<a href="https://youtu.be/8LiTxEUxSHU?si=ADwZ02rO-g85M-NA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Funky Stars</a>” by Quazar.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="&quot;Sanguine Wastes&quot; - Legacy of Rust OST {GUS/Fluidsynth/ADL/Arachno/SC-55} (HQ) [Map02]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTMQrlLGVsE?start=1090&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Using sound modules alongside DOOM like the <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/146948-legacy-of-rust-sc-55-soundtrack-for-the-2024-rerelease-of-doom-doom-2/">Roland SC-55</a> is a practice as old as time. Trying different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont">SoundFonts </a>lets you change how the song sounds.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Legacy of Rust’s </em>first level, “Scar’s Gate,” is fairly routine by <em>DOOM</em> standards, something old to ease the player in. But the transition to the second stage, a fantastical portal into hell with a sharper difficulty bump than is normal, is elevated by the sudden inclusion of “The Shores of Heaven.” This transition itself is as good a metaphor as you can get for the evolution of <em>DOOM</em>.&nbsp;<br><em>Legacy of Rust </em>is what happens when a community is fostered over decades, constantly in conversation with itself and iterating, in large part thanks to code and tools that are open and free. Precious few games allowed to thrive for decades beyond their release the way <em>DOOM </em>has, that is the beauty of the Doomworld community. It is only appropriate to have the first real expansion in ages led by some of the best people the Doomworld forums has to offer. That’s what really gives me goosebumps, and is why I can’t stop blasting “The Shores of Heaven.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is going to be released at the tail end of winter, with United Label confirming it will be out February 2025. An exact day has not been given. A new trailer has been released to showcase some of the gameplay, and show the new enemy that the rats will have to face, and those are their winged counterparts, the bats. The bats are ferocious and bloodthirsty, but so is the new lead character Arlo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2 | Release Date Gameplay Trailer | Wishlist - PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sg5FBayiuWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is set after the events of the southern war in the original Tails of Iron. Moving north, players assume the role of Arlo who is the son of the Warden of the North. The North is under attack and it is up to Arlo to push back the enemy. United Label has said that this sequel will feature new gameplay elements, including a day and night cycle. This cycle dictates which enemies will be awake and a threat to Arlo, with some only active at night. There are also 15 challenge beasts to fight, and these have rare materials that can be used to improve gear. The base building has been upgraded too, with Arlo able to rebuild the settlement of Winter’s Edge to get access to improved gear. In battle, Arlo can have weapons equipped with one of four elemental powers, with those being fire, ice, poison, and electricity.&nbsp; Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be a semi open world RPG, with six different environments to explore.</p>

<p>In our Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter preview, Adrian said, <em>“In short, Tails of Iron 2 is more of the same, though this time with an arresting Game-of-Thrones-Winter-is-Coming aesthetic. Quite frankly, that’s more than enough to leave us very excited to get our teeth sunk into the full game upon release.”</em></p>

<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be available on PC, Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>Lorn’s Lure is the tale of an android who is chasing a weird visual glitch through an enormous, dreary, dystopian edifice made up of retro 90s PC textures. The game’s signature trick is that you can clamber up pretty much any surface using your pickaxes, as long as you have the stamina.</p>
<p>It can be arduous – I had a go of the demo a couple of years back and got myself stuck underneath a vast, slatey overhang. But it’s also very restful. There’s no rush to finish, no real active threat element, and much to be curious about. Who is this android you’re controlling, exactly? Why are they drawn to that glitch? Who else inhabits this world?</p>
<p>“I do like a megastructure, and I do like an abandoned megastructure, and I really like freely exploring an abandoned megastructure,” Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">wrote</a> of Lorn’s Lure back in 2023, efficiently describing the progress of my own thoughts while playing the demo. If you’re intrigued, the demo is still available and was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1417930/view/4333109568245803574?l=english">recently updated</a> with a new intro cutscene, Steam Deck compatibility, overhauled level design and new music, among other additions.</p>

It's unclear if this version, if real, is a full remake or remaster or something in-between.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Top 25 Nintendo Switch Games</h3></div></output><p>MySims is a spin-off to the EA's main life simulation game The Sims and tasks players with rebuilding a dilapidated town, attracting new residents, and decorating it to keep them all happy. It later came to Nintendo DS and spawned myriad subsequent entries itself, including MySims Kingdom, Party, Racing, Agents, and Skyheroes.</p><p>The last of these was released in 2010, meaning it's been 14 years since EA last released a MySims game, but with The Sims 4 a decade old itself and The Sims 5 nowhere in sight, it perhaps wanted to inject some life into the franchise in the meantime.</p><p>MySims would be the first game in The Sims franchise to come to Nintendo Switch, with the franchise otherwise appearing on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and seemingly everywhere but a Nintendo console.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-getting-a-fantasy-podcast-series-starring-all-the-companions-in-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dragon Age fans will be treated to an eight-part narrative podcast series set in BioWare’s fantasy universe starring all the companions set to appear in the upcoming The Veilguard.</p><p>Dragon Age: Vows &amp; Vengeance, which kicks off August 29, 2024, features podcast-exclusive characters voiced by Mae Whitman, Bridgette Lundy-Paine, and Armen Taylor, as well as appearances from all the companions in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> including Harding (Ali Hillis), Davrin (Ike Amadi), Bellara (Jee Young Han), Neve (Jessica Clark), Taash (Jin Maley), Emmrich (Nick Boraine), Manfred (Matt Mercer), and Lucanis (Zach Mendez).</p><p>BioWare said listeners will learn more about the companions’ backstories (the teaser trailer is below). New episodes will be released weekly. Here’s the release schedule:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>8/29 - Episode 1: Featuring Nadia, Elio, and Drayden</li><li>9/5 - Episode 2: Featuring Harding</li><li>9/12 - Episode 3: Featuring Davrin</li><li>9/19 - Episode 4: Featuring Bellara</li><li>9/26 - Episode 5: Featuring Taash</li><li>10/3 - Episode 6: Featuring Lucanis</li><li>10/10 - Episode 7: Featuring Emmrich</li><li>10/17 - Episode 8: Featuring Neve</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>When the first episode airs, you’ll meet Nadia, a retired thief unknowingly working for the Dread Wolf. Nadia and her lover, Elio, find themselves in the midst of something much greater than them - a threat to the entire world - until Elio is seemingly banished to the Fade. Enter: Drayden, a writer with an interesting connection to the Fade. Drayden and Nadia team up on an arduous adventure to rescue Elio from the Fade with a little help from some familiar friendly faces.</blockquote><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard itself launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S this Halloween: October 31, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Release Date Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>It's been a long road to The Veilguard's release in October. It was first announced way, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-4-the-dread-wolf-rises-teaser-breakdown"><u>way back in 2018</u></a>, and later that year was given the title <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-dreadwolf-title-and-logo-officially-revealed-ign-news"><u>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</u></a>. In 2022, we learned that an alpha build of the game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-just-hit-an-important-stage-of-development"><u>playable from start to finish</u></a>, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>we finally saw the first official trailer</u></a> with a fall 2024 release window.</p><p>At the time, it was revealed that the name of the game was being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>changed to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> to place more emphasis on the party of protagonists, rather than returning Dragon Age character Solas, known as the Dreadwolf.</p><p>We've since learned plenty of tidbits about what to expect. The Veilguard apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue"><u>has 140,000 lines of dialogue</u></a>, will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc"><u>Steam-native on the storefront</u></a>, has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveals-a-host-of-customizable-difficulty-options-including-the-ability-to-turn-death-off-entirely"><u>customizable difficulty options</u></a>, and will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>import choices made in previous games</u></a>. We've also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more"><u>gotten a look at the game's voice cast</u></a>, and we've learned that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy"><u>all possible companions will be pansexual</u></a>.</p><p> In September, we'll have an IGN First for Dragon Age: The Veilguard with tons more detail.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

Fortunately, you can get random rolls of this Exotic, and there's no limit on how many you can buy.</p><p>The only catch? Xur will only sell these to you if you've completed Duality, as merely unlocking the mission isn't enough. Xur won't have Exotic class items every week, so you'll want to farm for Strange Coins to have enough to buy multiple rolls.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Wormhusk Crown (Exotic Hunter helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356217" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356217"></a><figcaption>Wormhusk Crown</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg"></figure><p>Wormhusk Crown works very nicely in clutch moments during PvP matches, as dodging gives a small health and shield bump, and with the right build in PvE, it can be devastating when utilized properly. The stats on this roll aren't the greatest, as while strength is pretty good, intellect, discipline, and recovery are very low. You can give this one a skip unless you have a rare version of it with even worse stats than this.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 28</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Doom Fang Pauldron (Exotic Titan gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356218" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356218"></a><figcaption>Doom Fang Pauldron</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg"></figure><p>This funky Exotic is designed for Titans who like to focus on their void abilities. Defeating targets with Void damage has a chance to grant an escalating bonus to damage with Void weapons, so you can pair this up with the Wavesplitter Xur is offering to dish out some lethal power. It also has a few extra perks related to Void melee and Super abilities, so this is a great Exotic for Titan Void-specialists. The stats on this roll are very weird, but it can potentially work nicely if you're looking to specialize further in charging up your Super thanks to the high intellect stat. Recovery is also decent, but you'll need to mod your discipline and resilience stats.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 24</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3>Claws of Ahamkara (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356219"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg"></figure><p>It's debatable how useful an extra melee charge is, but the nice thing with Claws of Ahamkara is that you can spawn an Orb of Power when you land a final charged melee blow on an enemy. This should work quite nicely with a Strand or Prismatic subclass--Arcane Needle on its own has three charges--and the right build will allow you to become Radiant when picking up those orbs. While mobility is a little too high and intellect is quite low, the rest of the stats are nicely balanced, so this is worth grabbing.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience:

changed how he conducts business in The Final Shape. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

According to Maximum Entertainment CEO Christina Seelye, the two can help each other equally.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking to Game Developer at Gamescom, she explained that selling physical versions of a game can help get more eyes on a title, particularly online. Amazon and in-person stores like GameStop go a long way, and that attention can spread to digital stores like Steam and PlayStation Network.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seelye noted Maximum itself has shown this "time and time again...there is no cannibalization." Citing the choice to release a physical collection of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, she claimed doing so helped digital sales for those individual games go "up and up and up."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Physical games? What is it good for?">Physical games? What is it good for?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the ease of buying games digitally, Seelye believes people who see a game at the store remain a "different audience" worth courting. Discs and cartridges can also give publishers a chance to engage with that audience in a different, more tactile way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essentially, there's a reason deluxe editions remain so prevalent. The collector angle works, since it offers "little special moments" for a game's community that furthers interest in a title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, Seelye acknowledged that Maximum is in a position other publishers might not be. Even with potential partners like Limited Run, a physical release is not always viable, and it can be further complicated by a game's genre, platforms, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with that, the physical games will remain an essential part of the industry. Much of that will be determined through opporunity, and advised it'd be smart for able publishers to stick with the tried-and-true format.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're still making money," Seelye assured. "Not as much margin as you're going to sell digitally, but you're still making money, plus all of these other benefits."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
