			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, Tuesday, August 19, 2025, that's 45-minutes long, featuring legendary game director and designer Masahiro Sakurai, that's all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>The news first broke on the Nintendo Today app, before being published to social media, as we've seen Nintendo do several times now regarding major news and updates for its products. It'll kick off at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Aug 19 at 6am PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders/status/1957432749125779831">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Kirby Air Riders account reads. "<em>The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be the first we've seen of the first non-Smash Bros. game from Sakurai in years, and the first Switch 2 game directed by Sakurai. The game is also currently set to release sometime later this year, so it's likely that tomorrow's presentation will also include an official release date announcement, along with a bevy of information and gameplay footage of what to expect from the follow-up to the 2003 GameCube title, Kirby Air Ride.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-verdun-isonzo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gallipoli-is-isonzo-and-verdun-dev-blackmills-next-wwi-era-shooter.1272795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Verdun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Isonzo&nbsp;</em>developer BlackMill Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli</em>, the next game in its series of World War I-set shooters, and it's promising "the most authentic WWI FPS battles yet".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will shift the focus from the traditional European battlefields featured in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tannenberg-holding-historical-wolf-truce-event" rel="nofollow">previous games</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/verdun-christmas-truce-dlc-supports-charity" rel="nofollow">franchise</a> to those of the Middle Eastern front. That means you can expect a healthy dose of desert warfare alongside the usual "beach landings, historical classes, and realistic weaponry".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065940/view/834973992999715448" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, BlackMill says&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will come complete with its very own "signature game mode", and while the studio doesn't want to give too much away about that mode right now, it'll all revolve around momentum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=KaAK5DS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=owOReAWI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will continue its predecessors' focus on WWI-era realism.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will support 50 players and will split them into two teams. If you're on the attacking team, you'll need to try and complete your objectives as fast as you can, but the defending side will be trying to scupper you as you do so.</p>

<p>It sounds as though momentum will be incorporated as a gameplay mechanic rather than just a vague sense of initiative; BlackMill is promising opportunities to regain lost momentum other than completing objectives.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to improved gameplay and visuals in&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>compared to previous installments; the studio says it's "gone to great lengths to faithfully recreate" Middle Eastern front weaponry, which it says was "usually quite obsolete, weird, or both".</p>

<p>BlackMill is also promising "major improvements to progression, loadouts, cosmetics, and the health system", but you'll have to wait for future updates in order to learn specifics about how all of those things are being improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-crouching.jpg?itok=QHbOtTL- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-crouching.jpg?itok=LD4xPdxg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can expect plenty of improvements in&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, you can expect to play it on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starrupture-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starrupture-early-access-release-date-revealed-for-january.1272792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Creepy Jar has announced the Early Access release date for its open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, and it's set to launch on PC early next year.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1631270/view/597409112655921163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>will be coming to Steam Early Access on January 6th. Creepy Jar says it knows "you will need to wait a little bit longer than you originally anticipated" for the game's launch, but that the delay will mean "more polish [and] more improvements".</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter game with base-building elements that was first revealed as part of the PC Gaming Show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/green-hell-dev-starrupture" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2023</a>. The name is a reference to the star at the heart of the game's solar system, which creates "extreme living conditions" for those residing on the planet nearby.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=Aaxun9oo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=h8uBugG8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Early Access next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Creepy Jar describes its game as a "first-person open world base-building game with advanced combat and tons of exploration" in which you can either play on your own or as part of a group.</p>

<p>You'll explore an "ever-changing open world" in which you'll have to construct a "complex industrial system" in order to "extract resources, produce goods and expand your base", in a similar fashion to titles like&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>Once the base is built, you'll also have to make sure you're defending it from the "hordes of alien monsters" that will lay siege to it, as well as the constantly-changing conditions of the planet on which you find yourself.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, which also gives a pretty good sense of what you can expect from Creepy Jar's game, right here.</p>




<p><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is set to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 6th. You can read our very own Ashley's preview of the spacefaring base-builder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/starrupture-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was ready to skip MicroProse's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deck-and-conn">Deck &amp; Conn</a>, on the grounds of it being far too early in the week for games that consist entirely of dials and rangefinders, but then a scrambled communique from Sin Vega alerted me to the fact that it's the work of Elissa Black, one of the peeps behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/objects-in-space">Objects In Space</a>, which I think is one of my top five <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a>. So here we are. </p>
<p>At a glance, Deck &amp; Conn is Objects In Space, but turn-based and minus Objects In Space's slightly distracting 3D background elements. That's to say, it's a testing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategickal</a> simulation that seats you in front of a terrifying retro pixel display, and expects you to trace distress calls, manage your fretful crew, spin up torpedoes and so forth, all without bursting your puny monkey brain. </p><!--more-->
<p>It takes inspiration from older MicroProse games - the ones made by the MicroProse of the 1990s, before they got repeatedly bought and skinned and eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse#Brand_revival_(2018%E2%80%93present)">wrapped around the bones of a different company</a> - and the 1971 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> mainframe game, which is from before my time, though I think I've played one of its descendants in Thomas Spreen's Rescue!.</p>
<p>Being turn-based, Deck &amp; Conn should be a mite less stressful and exhilarating than Objects In Space, but I'm already having kittens over the sensor management tab in the screenshots. Remember: just because there's a dot on your radar doesn't mean that's where the ship you're fighting actually is. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The noble vessel you command in Deck &amp; Conn is "a Cold War-style nuclear corvette", which sounds about as safe as a bed of rusty nails. I'm guessing that it will not have enough reactor power for all the individual things you need it to do, prior to upgrades at least. Please brace to be impacted by these bullet points, direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3828500/Deck__Conn/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Command a nuclear-powered space corvette in a Cold War-inspired sci-fi universe</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and system management</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions</li>
<li>Individual combat scenarios to hone your tactical skills</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy ships to gain rewards and shape your legacy</li>
<li>Pixel art visuals inspired by early '90s MicroProse classics</li>
<li>Respond to HQ orders and make tough choices in the forever-war</li>
<li>Inspired by the 1971 Super Star Trek mainframe game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Black's other previous games include <a href="https://expectproblems.itch.io/swords-of-freeport">Swords Of Freeport</a>, "a text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s", which "is part MUD and part BBS Game - but without the need for a BBS. You can play it on your home machine alone, or play/install it on an internet-accessible machine where others can join you - anywhere they have terminal access."</p><p>That sounds like catnip to a certain venerable species of internet wayfarer. I think I prefer the space submarines personally. If you are similarly fond of astral tugboats with copious blind sides, you might enjoy playing or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-space-strategy-sim-nebulous-channels-eight-years-in-the-us-navy">reading about Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.</p>
<p><em>Small disclosure: Sin Vega is an online acquaintance of Elissa Black from back in the day.</em></p>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leak has revealed that 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leaks have been surfacing in large numbers recently, with several new details emerging over the past couple of days. We recently learned that the upcoming title will feature some remastered maps and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-leaks-remastered-maps-a-return-of-specialist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of specialist abilities</a>. Now, we know how many 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-13-original-6v6-maps">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 13 Original 6v6 Maps</h2>



<p>The details about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 6v6 maps come from a reliable COD leaker/insider, TheGhostOfHope. According to their recent post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957173644649488771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. Out of these, there are 13 original maps and three remastered ones from Black Ops 2. </p>



<p>Moreover, two maps will be available at launch for large-scale Skirmish, which features the leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-accidentally-reveals-20v20-wingsuit-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wingsuit mode</a>. Lastly, players can expect “plentiful” post-launch content. For comparison, Black Ops 6 had 12 6v6 maps at launch and 4 for Gunfight. </p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-characters-leaked">Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Characters Leaked </h2>



<p>Hope also provided players with a Black Ops 7 campaign <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957124861173678175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> yesterday, which revealed which characters will be available for 4-person co-op. These include David “Section” Mason, Mike Harper, Eric Samuels, and Chloe “Karma” Lynch. However, as the information about the Black Ops 7 campaign characters and the launch maps doesn’t come from an official source, readers should treat it with caution. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta may be over, but there’s still work to be done to prepare for the release, with a fresh slew of exclusive rewards available to earn through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 10</a>, Battlefield 6 is one of the most anticipated games of the year, which was proven by it taking just a few hours for over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> to assemble on Steam. </p>



<p>While it’s too late to earn the exclusive Battlefield 6 Open Beta rewards that were available, there’s now more loot to secure to bolster your locker before the game releases. Here are all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-rewards-amp-how-to-get-them">All Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Rewards &amp; How to Get Them</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Loot to earn. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Six exclusive cosmetic bundles are available in the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 pass, which will be immediately unlocked in Battlefield 6 on release.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are cosmetic items, so won’t provide any boost to you in gameplay, but are a decent way of showing your support to the Battlefield franchise and you can flex on other players in the lobby with items they won’t be able to get their hands on.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is available now and expires on October 7, just a few days before the release of Battlefield 6. In total, 30 exclusive rewards are available, as <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on X</a> (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>Check out all the exclusive rewards available in the pass in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Western Front Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Muller Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aurora Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blackburn Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Commander Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">49</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sovereign Soldier Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">60</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-other-rewards-are-available">What Other Rewards Are Available?</h2>



<p><strong>While the highlight of the pass is undoubtedly the exclusive rewards available to secure for Battlefield 6, there’s plenty more up for grabs with 60 free tiers and over 50 new rewards.</strong></p>



<p>This includes a journey back in time through the Battlefield franchise, with rewards inspired by Battlefield 1, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4.</p>



<p>There are still a few months to go until Battlefield 6 releases, so working through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is a good way to kill time while you wait.</p>

A brand new Nintendo Direct focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> will land tomorrow, Tuesday August 19 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, Nintendo revealed the show first via its Nintendo Today smartphone app, and promised the broadcast would feature 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Switch 2 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is notable for being the first new project in years from Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director of Nintendo's smash hit Super Smash Bros. series. Tomorrow's deep dive look at the game is also intriguingly timed, suggesting it may finally be playable at this week's Gamescom event in Cologne.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, Nintendo has kept details of Kirby Air Riders close to its chest, though has said the pink puffball-staring racer should be expected to launch on Switch 2 later this year. It seems likely tomorrow's Direct will provide a firmer release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced earlier this year alongside further details of the Switch 2 itself, Kirby Air Riders will be a sequel to the 2003 cult classic Kirby Air Ride for GameCube. Production on the game began in earnest back in 2023, following the end of Sakurai's time overseeing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's lengthy schedule of downloadable content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no suggestion tomorrow's show will include any other Switch 2 games beyond Kirby Air Riders (sorry, Metroid fans). Still, more information on what's next from Sakurai and his talented development team should suffice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Fortunately, an all-new Road to Battlefield 6 event for Battlefield 2042 will bridge the gap, as it kicks off today and runs through October 7. Players can expect new content, including a free rewards pass that EA says will celebrate the legacy of the Battlefield series with new gear, a reimagining of the fan-favorite Iwo Jima map, and more.</p><p>EA added that the event will feature 20 exclusive rewards for Battlefield 6, and these can be unlocked in Battlefield 2042 ahead of its launch. Players can pick up the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle, and for aerial warfare, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot are being pulled out of the vault so that they can be put back into service.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Cory Barlog (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFbeaM0hp_c">pictured above being asked rapid-fire questions about God of War</a>), director of God of War II and 2018's God of War, shared some vague details about what the team at Sony Santa Monica is currently working on. Sony Santa Monica is the developer, most recently, behind God of War Ragnarök.</p><p>"I’d like to share a little bit about our new project," Barlog wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0JHwrN1fGFLZGN5BBa7qneq6Qcc3prpVKvHpfPnZBewgcnZ4sehaHporp97xaLq3Jl">Facebook</a>. "I’m incredibly proud of what the team at Santa Monica Studio has been accomplishing. It’s a technically ambitious project, something that’s not easy to achieve. This is a new IP we’ve been working on for years, and if all goes well, we’re planning to show it to you later this year. I couldn’t be more excited." Barlog ended the post with two heart emojis.</p><p>Barlog's post doesn't specify that this is Sony Santa Monica <em>next</em> project or that it is its <em>only</em> project. Since the release of Ragnarök's free rogue-lite mode DLC, it has been quiet about what's next.</p><p>In terms of God of War, developer Bluepoint Games (primarily known for its remakes of Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls) was working on a live-service game connected to the God of War franchise. That game was publicly cancelled earlier this year according to a statement Sony shared with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>Whatever this new project may be, we will apparently learn more about it later this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-working-on-a-new-technically-ambitious-ip]]></content:encoded>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has run <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">its last open beta</a>. This, obviously, is a tragedy. How else am I meant to spend my weekends? Where else can I drive around with four loads of C4 strapped to the boot, or engage in high-flying aerial duels? Well, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>But why go back? Well, it seems as though EA understands a widespread longing may have been on the cards with Battlefield 6's absence, and has therefore introduced a limited-time event to the older title to keep folks engaged for the next few months. A celebration of sorts for 2042 before everyone leaps off towards greener pastures.</p>
<p>This new Battlefield 2042 update - which is straight up titled the "Road to Battlefield 6" update - includes a free battle pass full of little goodies, a revamp of the Iwo Jima map, and some prizes for those looking to jump into Battlefield 6 come October. Some of those battle pass rewards I mentioned earlier carry over, making 2042 a must-play for early-onset completionists.</p>

<p>It's a clever ploy, offering permanent rewards for the new game. EA did it too for the Battlefield 6 beta, offering various cosmetics for hitting career levels or finishing challenges. It's not like the Beta needed any help, but it surely would have brought folks back for the second beta even if they likely were fulfilled on the first beta alone. Battlefield 2042 offering such rewards will inevitably push those who never played the game - or maybe touched it only briefly - back into the fray.</p><p>Is this taking advantage of people's FOMO? The voice in their heads that demands they need everything? Yeah absolutely, and as a former WoW mount collector that can be a real burden, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar">it'll also inject a lot of life into Battlefield 2042</a> in its sunset period. For people who have stuck with Battlefield 2042 through thick and thin it'll be like one last hurrah, and for Battlefield 6 refugees it'll be a cool way of passing the time.</p>
<p>It does also help that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Battlefield 2042 is a lot better now than it used to be</a>. After years of updates, tweaks and changes, it's really come into its own as of late. While a sizable number of players who'll jump into Battlefield 2042 for its Road to Battlefield 6 event will be fair weather friends, there for a good time and not a long time, it may very well do wonders in remedying popular sentiment around the game that lingers from its troubled launch.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>So yeah I'll hop back into Battlefield 2042 - I too haven't really touched it since its release. I'll try out the new KFS2000, I'll squad up with some friends, and hey, maybe I will crash some helicopters into people. The Battlefield 6 rewards are nice and I'll take great joy in showing them off come October.</p><p>But honestly? I just think it's a nice curtain call for a game that'll inevitably be left largely behind when Battlefield 6 comes along. I do hope that for many people, it'll leave a fond final memory of 2042 before the game is memory holed and thrown down the same well Hardline lives in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> shows a side of Bandai Namco that we don’t always see. Sure, this is an anime-flavoured Japan-centric roguelike brawler, but it’s one that’s priced as a smaller indie title, and it is doing things just that little bit differently. Personally, I think we could do with more of this kind of thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D87bFNKiKS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The village of Shinju, named after the benevolent god who watches over it, is home to Towa. A being that is neither human nor god, Towa lives as the village guardian, protecting and nurturing the inhabitants of the village. Shinju remains an idyllic haven until Magatsu arrives. Alongside an army of monstrous Magaori, Magatsu spreads his miasma across the land, poisoning and corrupting everything that lies before him.</p>


<p>Towa, with eight chosen ‘prayer children’ from the village, sets forth against the forces of evil, wielding the Sword of Ablution and the staff of Divination, both of which allow her to tackle the monsters and the corruption that lie before her.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not Towa you directly take control of. You actually control one of the Prayer Children – starting out with Rekka in our hands-on – but Towa is tethered to you, following you into battle, while you protect them from harm.</p>

<p>Combat isn’t quite as you’d expect either, with Rekka carrying two swords, each of which have a finite amount of energy. When you’ve used up the energy, the damage from that sword will halve, forcing you to swap to the other option. Each has specific qualities, and ranges, so you have to plan ahead as you face each foe. It takes some getting used to, with early encounters feeling a bit clunky as you consistently ‘break’ each sword over and over again, but you soon find the rhythm of attacks, and start to learn how to use each one effectively.</p>

<p>Besides your standard attacks, there’s also special abilities which are provided by your support character. Towa is able to cast a zone of protection that freezes enemies, or summon a giant hand to bash the bad guys with. Dodging plays an important role too, made somewhat easier by enemy attacks being displayed via glowing area-of-effect zones.</p>
<p>Defeating all the enemies in an area will drop some kind of reward, with Graces enhancing a character’s attributes, or ores being usable in crafting back at the village. These rewards get better based on your performance, and you’re given a selection to choose from so you can tailor your character through your run – or Journey as the game calls them. Graces come in different levels too, so if you’re lucky you might find an Epic move nestling amongst more ordinary ones.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made it through the opening moments, you can assemble a team of two from the eight Prayer Children. Each of them has their own look, weaponry and abilites, but one member of the team must be the Tsurugi, the main attacker, while the other becomes the Kagura, who supports them with spells. You can switch it so the Kagura stays in place, though the Tsurugi can only go a limited distance from the Kagura.</p>

<p>Playing solo sees you controlling both as a team, and you tend to find that the Kagura ultimately loses a lot of health as they’re not your primary focus, and they don’t quite dash in time with your main character. It feels as though the designers really want you to play in co-op, and fortunately there’s both local and online options to make that possible. It definitely makes the game easier, and you only have the one character to worry about.</p>
<p>As a roguelike, runs feel fairly familiar, with each area housing a small number of enemies or a boss, and collecting better abilities and more power the further you go. I like that you can see the different rewards across each route, but otherwise this remains about making yourself as powerful as possible, while collecting permanent upgrades for further runs.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to keep you busy outside of the Journeys when you return to the village. Forging new swords is a key task, and it presents you with a minigame that lets you design and customise your own blade. It’s a little unclear what you’re doing – it should have a tutorial for all of the sections the first time you do it – but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s an intriguing task. Swords can be equipped by all characters so that removes any issues with swapping between them, but upgrades are limited, so you will need to focus on your favourites from the roster and their upgrade trees ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>There’s some interesting differences between the in-game visuals and the artwork from the cutscenes. Where the in-game action is an attractive, isometric-view anime battler, the cutscenes boast traditonal Japanese art, evoking a more realistic and human approach. There’s then further comic-like art during the fully-voiced character conversations, and while all of them look fantastic in their own way, there’s some visual dissonance to the way that each character is perceived. Towa in particular is pictured in the cutscenes as a powerful goddess, in traditional Japanese garb, while the in-game version of her comes across as a mildly annoying traditional anime girl. It doesn’t detract from the action, but it’s an odd choice.<br>
That said, I really like the design of the eight Prayer Children, especially the adorably huge canine Bampuku who makes a great companion for the Carp-like Nishiki.</p>
<p>Towa and the Gaurdians of the Sacred Tree makes a good first impression, and the giant boss characters you face along the way add a real sense of scale to the action. The story and characters are interesting, and the action sufficiently unique, to immediately draw you in and, with the game launching on 18th September, I’m looking forward to spending more time with them through the coming weeks.</p>

No release date or window has been shared, but we'll be getting an official announcement at Gamescom 2025, which kicks off tomorrow (19th August).</p>
<p>And, yes, the wording is just 'Nintendo" an not Switch or Switch 2, so we have no idea if the game is coming to one or both consoles. If we had to guess, it's <em>probably</em> aiming for Switch 2, but that's just speculation.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gukmiw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Shenmue III Enhanced is exactly what it sounds like — an upgraded version of the long-awaited 2019 Shenmue sequel created by former Sega legend Yu Suzuki. This version will bring upgraded graphics, gameplay tweaks, and improvements to character interactions.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of all the upgrades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Enhanced Graphics &amp; Performance</strong> – Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong> – Refined, more detailed environments and characters.<br>
<strong>- DLSS/FSR Support</strong> – High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).<strong><br>
-</strong> <strong>Increased NPC Density</strong> – The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong> – An optional camera perspective inspired by <em>Shenmue I &amp; II</em>, alongside the modern view.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong> – Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Improved Interactions</strong> – Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded QTE timing window for more accessible gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Menu &amp; UX Enhancements</strong> – Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Optionality First</strong> – All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally announced at E3 2015 as a Kickstarter project, Shenmue III released to mixed reviews four years later on; some loved that it stayed faithful to the Dreamcast originals, while others were frustrated with the lack of changes and the story. Our sister site Push Square rather enjoyed it for what it is, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/shenmue_iii">scoring the game a 7/10</a>.</p>
<p>ININ Games has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/shenmue-iii-on-switch-2-publishers-latest-tease-suggests-it-might-be-happening">teasing this announcement for some time</a>, so we're glad the wait is over! Now, to see what it looks like at Gamescom, then.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-is-europe%E2%80%99s-best-selling-new-game-of-2025-so-far.1272729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In what feels like the greatest period of turmoil for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/">Ubisoft</a> in the company's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to be the bright spark of life that the company needs, as a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">The Game Business</a> (backed by numbers from Europe's <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">Game Sales Data</a> firm) names it the best-selling new game in Europe in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>To clarify, Shadows is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling PC and console title in Europe of all the games released in 2025. It's not the best-selling game overall, since that marker unsurprisingly goes to last year's EA Sports FC 25, which will likely hold the title until <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">EA Sports FC 26</a> next month. But as of right now, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands above games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-drive-another-record-year-for-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and every other major release you can think of from this year so far.</p>



<p>In fact, according to GSD figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">Split-Fiction</a> is the only game to get close to Shadows as far as 2025 releases are concerned. The next-closest is Monster Hunter Wilds, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-early-digital-sales-toby-fox-deltarune/">Mario Kart World</a>, which is followed by Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, and Nightreign after that. Out of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe for 2025 so far, including games released last year and older, Split-Fiction, Wilds, World, Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, Nightreign, and Shadows are the only seven games released in 2025 to make the list.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the list not released in 2025 are <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which is having an incredible year despite being nearly eight years old at this point, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, which is enjoying a boost from Ubisoft revamping it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">Rainbow Six Siege X.</a></p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe on PC and consoles according to GSD, per The Game Business: </p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Split-Fiction</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Mario Kart World</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto Online</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</li>



<li>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</li>



<li>Battlefield 1</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that this is just what the sales charts for Europe's PC and console videogame releases look like so far. Those are the key words here, because by the end of this year, it's doubtful that Shadows will be able to hold onto that top spot for 2025 releases. Not just because EA Sports FC 26 is on the horizon, but because FC 26 is coming, and this year's new Call of Duty, and Battlefield 6, and Borderlands 4, and Ghost of Yotei, and Pokemon Legends Z-A, and The Outer Worlds 2 - and those are just some of the big autumn-to-winter-timed games we know about that have release dates.</p>



<p>We'll see what this top-20 list looks like in a few months' time. But for now, Ubisoft can enjoy its moment at the top.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-enhanced-wants-to-be-the-definitive-shenmue-iii-experience.1272726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shenmue&nbsp;</em>auteur Yu Suzuki and his studio Ys Net have announced&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>, a...well...enhanced re-release of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>that brings visual and gameplay improvements aplenty.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-nintendo-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>is slated for release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and "Nintendo" at some point in the future. No release date was revealed, and it's not specified whether "Nintendo" refers to both Switch 2 and the original Switch or just one of the two.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>will bring improved visuals and performance, complete with 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR on PC, and increased NPC density to help Niaowu feel "more alive with more characters populating the streets".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=UUdDARBq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=g0Xn-Hev 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>is getting a re-release in future, and it'll bring improvements galore.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the visuals getting some love, though. Ys Net is also promising gameplay tweaks, including a new "classic" camera mode that brings&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III</em>'s gameplay perspective closer to that of its predecessors.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to stamina system adjustments, Ryo's health being restored before fights, and "reduced money barriers for smoother progression", as well as the opportunity to skip certain cutscenes and conversations.</p>

<p>All of the gameplay improvements promised by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>can be switched off if you want the original gameplay experience, though, so if you just want to enjoy the game with its new and improved visuals, you can do that as well.</p>

<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>the first time, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2001's&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>. Launching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-release-date-delayed-three-months-to-november" rel="nofollow">eighteen years after that game</a>, it continues the story of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, who's on the hunt for his father's murderer.</p>




<p>Many of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>'s additions have seemingly been introduced to combat much of the criticism of the original game, including its slow pace, gated money grinds, and frustrating combat.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>before the enhanced version launches, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/878670/Shenmue_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA12289_00-SHENMUEIII0000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>.

              <p><span>This weekend, the 2025 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>Pokémon World Championships</span></a><span> were held in Anaheim. Most of the event was dedicated to the franchise’s multiple competitive scenes across video games, the card game, and fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>fighting scalpers for exclusive merchandise</span></a><span>, but the tournament’s closing ceremony also included some new announcements you might’ve missed if you didn’t stay up late to catch the livestream. If you missed the mini-Pokémon Presents showcase, here’s everything The Pokémon Company announced:</span></p>  <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternatus Emerges | Pokémon GO" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xN0zU-uMCs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Kicking things off was a quick trailer for </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. Eternatus, one of the legendary Pokémon from the Galar region, is the centerpiece of Pokémon Go Fest 2025’s Max Finale, taking place on August 23 and 24. Players at Worlds were able to get Eternatus early, as if those of us who couldn’t make it to Anaheim needed more reasons to feel FOMO.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Mega Evolution is coming this fall!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Next up is </span><i><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></i><span>, which is getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall. Mega versions of Altaria, Gyarados, and Blaziken will all be featured in the set coming to the mobile app’s new season.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Pokémon Unite</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Pokémon are on the way! | Pokémon UNITE" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQXlI_Sfmo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Three new playable characters were announced for MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. First up, Sinnoh water starter Emploeon will join the roster on September 19, followed by Dhelmise, who has a grappler kit that lets it latch onto enemies and get in close. Vaporeon will come sometime after, bringing Unite’s Eeveelution count to six. All that’s left are Jolteon and Flareon, then all the current versions of Eevee’s evolution line will have joined the roster.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Worlds | TCG | New Mega Evolution Pokémon ex Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uj-A1J_rf0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Outside of the mobile app, the regular </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG is also featuring Mega Evolutions pretty heavily next year. TPC showed off new ex cards for Mega Charizard X, Mega Gaurdivoir, and Mega Lucario, each of which has a really eye-catching manga-inspired art style. Mega Dragonite is also getting its first card, though the one shown wasn’t a full-art one like the others.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Fans were expecting a multiplayer mode in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after Nintendo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><span>let it slip that</span></a><span> the RPG would have some sort of “link play,” but the mode Game Freak announced at Worlds is a bit different from what people have been anticipating. The game will feature a four-player multiplayer mode in which players pit their parties against one another and earn points for each Pokémon they defeat within the three-minute time limit. According to </span><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/battle-with-trainers"><span>the game’s official website</span></a><span>, these matches can be played casually with friends or in a ranked mode.</span></p>

Tickets go on sale on September 17. The teaser trailer was light on details, but the official Pokémon website says XP will feature “panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Street Fighter Movie Photo Teases WWE Superstar Cody Rhodes as Guile]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile.1272714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The 2026 Street Fighter 6 movie is shaping up nicely. Cody Rhodes has been touted as one of the big-name stars set to light up the Street Fighter stage, and while it’s not official, we think we’ve gotten an idea of how Guile could look, presumably, with Cody playing (and looking) the part.</p>



<p>It’s not uncommon for WWE superstars to transition from the hallowed grounds of the squared circle to the silver screen. The likes of Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and Rowdy Roddy Piper famously paved the way. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson was the one to make the complete leap from professional wrestler to actor.</p>



<p>Others have followed suit—such as John Cena—and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Fighter</a> movie could catapult Cody Rhodes into greater superstardom.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-cody-rhodes-teaser-as-guile-for-2026-street-fighter-movie">First Cody Rhodes Teaser as Guile For 2026 Street Fighter Movie</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Acting has more than one royal family. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Actor and comedian <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewschulz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Schulz</a> is playing Dan in the Street Fighter movie. They recently took to their personal Instagram page to share a story showing the shadow of someone sporting an iconic hairstyle—Guile from Street Fighter.</p>



<p>Guile’s inverted shaven style is equal parts bizarre and legendary. I’ve never tried to replicate it, and it’s not something I’m going to try—although it’s nothing a few cans of hairspray couldn’t sort.</p>



<p>Again, we’ve not had official confirmation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-casts-m-bison-and-eyes-wwes-cody-rhodes-for-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cody Rhodes is playing Guile</a>. Eagle-eyed fans can infer this to be the case if they look at the song mentioned in the IG story. If you didn’t know, Kingdom by Downstait is Rhodes’ famous theme song he’s used for years. Put 2 and 2 together, and I think we get the picture.</p>

<p>The Street Fighter Movie cast also features more rumors and confirmed names, including Jason Momoa, 50 Cent, and fellow WWE star Roman Reigns.</p>



<p>Will the Street Fighter movie be a knockout? Or will it be a swing and a miss? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        Revisiting the 1996 RPG exposes both genius and madness.

    <div>
    
    <p><em>Daggerfall </em>certainly has '90s DOS RPG charm in spades.

<p>Ostensibly, C:\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia!</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons I chose <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_elder_scrolls_chapter_ii_daggerfall"><em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em></a> this time around: its co-creator, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/julian-lefay-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-passed-away-at-59/">Julian LeFay, recently passed away</a>, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then.</p>
<p>But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to <em>Daggerfall</em>, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.</p>
<p>I'll spoil the conclusion though: I still love this game. It's profoundly not for everybody, but it's definitely for me.</p>
<h2>The kids don’t get it</h2>
<p>OK, so we've established that I love <em>Daggerfall</em>. Knowing Ars Technica's readership, some of you probably do too. So who, exactly, doesn't like it?</p>
<p>Just search YouTube and you'll find a bunch of videos with titles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdaxG_bFASk&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I FORCED myself to play Daggerfall in 2025</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7NejhzVz3M&amp;t=537s&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">Skyrim Player Tries Daggerfall (It Goes Terribly)</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPZ0nYJM4XM&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I really tried. But I can't play Daggerfall anymore.</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Ouch. That's rough. Granted, one of those isn't actually negative if you sit through the video, but it still acknowledges that it's not easily accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Look, I get it.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> hails from an era when "game design" primarily meant "experiment with programming techniques to come up with cool, unproven stuff no one's seen before" rather than "meticulously craft a conveyor belt of nonstop fun via proven formulae."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Those experiments are all exciting and interesting, and it's refreshing to go back to an RPG from this era that was willing to try some wild ideas and deep systems, as opposed to most (not all!) RPGs today, which seem to have the same basic format with talent trees and so on.</p>
<p>I love that <em>Daggerfall</em> includes odd mechanics that you don't often see in RPGs, like climbing. I like its vast world and accurate representation of most wilderness as meaningless liminal space. I think its opaque and sometimes maddening faction reputation systems are fascinating. Its character progression system is detailed and interesting.</p>

      I know this is already what the game is best known for, but I'd be remiss if I didn't note that the scope of the game's map is <em>staggering</em>.

<p>For me, the most frustrating aspect to <em>Daggerfall</em> is not its jazzy mechanics. It's the mechanics that aren't explained at all.</p>
<p>For example, in the playthrough I started to refresh my memory for this article, I spent a couple of hours doing quests in Wayrest, one of the most prominent cities in the game. Everything seemed to be fine as I rode my horse around town helping people out, training my skills, and buying new gear. But then a guard ran up to me and arrested me for assault. Who did I assault? I had no idea, but I pled guilty in order to get a softer sentence, even though I was pretty sure I wasn't <em>actually</em> guilty.</p>
<p>I wrote that off as a fluke, but then it happened again: assault. And a third time, again assault. I couldn't fathom why I kept getting arrested.</p>
<p>To DuckDuckGo I went for a quick Internet search to see if anyone else was having this problem. It was pretty common, and the cause was something I never would have imagined: I had been riding my horse around the town, galloping for speed to complete quests faster. It turns out that galloping too close to wandering NPCs in the street registers as assault, with penalties of up to a month in prison and hefty fines.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>There was no feedback about this when it was happening. I didn't even know I was doing it. I don't specifically remember having this problem back in the '90s, but it seems likely I did, and I must have just shrugged it off, because back then I would have had no way of figuring out what was going on.</p>
<p>I get why this sort of thing is a big barrier to new players, but I also think some of the YouTubers I watched applied a double standard. One complained that the game doesn't explain itself, but then in the same video extolled the virtues of <em>Minecraft</em>—a game that explains itself even less.</p>

<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Save early and save often. That was ingrained in me by '90s gaming. Watching some of the YouTubers take this game on, it stressed me out how little they saved.

<p>It may be that we're more patient with learning games when we're kids. I played <em>Daggerfall</em> as a kid (well, a young teenager) so I'm relatively chill about its opaqueness and idiosyncrasies. That YouTuber played <em>Minecraft</em> as a kid, so that's the one he's willing to gloss over.</p>
<p>If you're willing to spend a lot of time on wikis (just like with <em>Minecraft</em>) then <em>Daggerfall</em> as a lot to offer to those who are patient. I often feel the most engaging games in the long run are ones that have a steeper learning curve up front.</p>
<h2>The unspoken spiritual successor</h2>
<p>Of course, it's not just the learning curve or opaque mechanics that are an issue for many players. A lot of people don't like <em>Daggerfall</em>'s procedurally generated world and quests—especially players who are used to <em>Skyrim</em>'s more hand-crafted environments and quest lines.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>Skyrim</em> has "Radiant Quests," which resemble <em>Daggerfall</em>'s. But with the exception of a relatively small number of main story missions, <em>Daggerfall</em> only has what <em>Skyrim</em> calls Radiant quests.</p>
<p>A loose modern analogue to that is <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, which has no meaningful story content at all. Some people might be more comfortable calling that a simulation than a game.</p>
<p>But there's another modern space title that has some strong resemblances to <em>Daggerfall</em>: Bethesda's own <em>Starfield</em>. As with <em>Daggerfall</em>, <em>Starfield</em> has a small cohort of obsessive fans amidst a much larger crowd that thinks it's just terrible.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When people bought <em>Starfield</em>, they were expecting <em>Skyrim</em> in space. I believe that one of the reasons a lot of people were disappointed was that they actually got <em>Daggerfall</em> in space, and that's a very different experience.</p>
<p>Like <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Starfield</em> not only accepts but even centers the notion that most of the environments are filled with, well, not a whole lot. It accurately reflects what space or wilderness actually are and makes much of the game a slow-paced mood piece rather than a constant dopamine dispenser.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p><em>Starfield</em> has some structural and design similarities to <em>Daggerfall</em>.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Most of <em>Starfield</em>'s dungeons are randomized. It's more about taking in the vibes and playing with the systems than it is about following an authored narrative—though <em>Starfield</em> does have an authored narrative. (It's just not the game's strongest suit, so it explains why people who are looking for that aren't big fans.)</p>
<p>Granted, there's little crossover between the original <em>Daggerfall</em> team and the folks who made <em>Starfield</em>. <em>Daggerfall</em> was pre-Todd Howard-as-creative-director and pre-Emil Pagliarulo, the two main creative leaders at Bethesda Game Studios since the <em>Morrowind</em> days.</p>
<p>But that's why it's all the more surprising that <em>Starfield</em> is, at best, a hybrid of the sensibilities of <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>. Given those YouTubers trying and failing to play <em>Daggerfall</em> in 2025, it's no wonder that <em>Starfield</em> didn't land for a lot of people.</p>
<p>(I quite like it, personally, but I also like <em>Daggerfall</em>, so I'm either a masochist, old and archaic, or just plain wrong, depending on who you ask.)</p>

<h2>A pure expression of one of gaming’s oldest dreams</h2>
<p>There has long been a recurring dream in PC gaming of one super game that would allow you to fully live out a particular fantasy life of your choosing. Whether it was intended by developers, promised in marketing, or just in hopeful players' heads, there's an appeal to the idea of living an alternate existence in a sophisticated simulated world that's so immersive in its escapism that you reliably forget your real life for hours on end. The idea is "I want to be a space trader," or "I want to be a wandering fantasy adventurer," and the game gives you a toolkit that's both wide and deep to experience that entirely on your own terms.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>A lot of times, the titles that went for this on some level seemed more like simulations than games or stories. They were less consistently fun than other games, but they were often profoundly ambitious.</p>
<p>Since they were all about helping a player live out something in their imaginations, they were also prone to viscerally negative reactions at launch from people who had personal expectations that didn't map to the reality of what a game can actually do or chooses to focus on. (This continues today: look at the reactions to <em>No Man's Sky</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and yes, <em>Starfield</em>.)</p>
<p><em>Daggerfall</em> is one of those games. It is not for everybody. But for that niche group of players who are up for something jazzy and simulation-y that takes risks to let them live an alternate fantasy life that's as much in their head canon as on the screen, it's one of the best games of all time.</p>
<p>I strongly believe it's important to judge a game (or any other art or media) more on whether it achieves what it's <em>going for</em> than whether it meets whatever external expectations you might bring to it. If you agree, then that puts <em>Daggerfall</em> in a better position than if you have a more prescriptive attitude about game design.</p>
<p>The fidelity expectations of modern AAA titles and accompanying scope and cost make the kind of experimental, life-sim focus of a game like <em>Daggerfall</em> all but impossible to pursue now, but I miss it. Personally, I'll usually take a deeply flawed work of sheer ambition over a retread of proven ideas I've already experienced before, no matter how skillfully crafted and consistently fun the latter is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I enjoy a good formula game now and then; my point was exactly that when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-dad-rock-of-video-games-and-i-love-it/">wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> a few months ago. But as much as I have enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, it won't stick with me for 30 years.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> has, and revisiting it this week, I can see that's not purely because of nostalgia. It represents a maximalist philosophy of game design I feel is sorely underrepresented in today's market.</p>

      The Unity version of <em>Daggerfall</em> installs on top of a normal DOS installation, and it makes the game much, much more playable in 2025, with additions like long view distances.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Kirby Air Riders was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-getting-a-kirby-air-ride-sequel/1100-6530561/">back in April</a> during a Nintendo Direct that revealed a bevy of Nintendo Switch 2 games, though at the time all that was shown off was a pre-rendered trailer. Not much is known about this sequel, but with tomorrow's Direct running at around 45 minutes, that will soon change. The game will also mark the first time Sakurai has directed a Kirby title since the original Air Rider for the GameCube.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo hasn't held a traditional Direct since its full Switch 2 reveal, instead opting for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">Partner Showcase in July</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-showcase-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6861/">Indie World Showcase</a> earlier this month. The Partner Showcase didn't have too many massive reveals, though it did include a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-coming-to-switch-2-next-year/1100-6533579/">new Monster Hunter Stories</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/once-upon-a-katamari-revealed-gets-october-release-date/1100-6533587/">Katamari</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-trailer-shows-partner-attacks-and-more/1100-6533582/">fresh look at Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. The Indie World Showcase was on the quieter side too, but still well worth a look for some neat upcoming titles.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced that a Kirby Air Riders Direct will air tomorrow, 19th August. The video presentation will be approximately 45 minutes long and deliver info on the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive.</p>
<p>The news of the Direct was posted on Nintendo Today, the publisher's mobile app.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tune in tomorrow Tuesday, August 19th at 2pm UK time for a livestreamed Kirby Air Riders Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Very little on the game has been revealed so far, although we got this description on the game's listing on <a href="http://nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kirby Air Riders, a brand new title originated from the Nintendo GameCube classic racing-action game Kirby Air Ride, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 this year – directed by Masahiro Sakurai.</p></blockquote>
<p>A trailer for Kirby Air Riders was released back in April. The trailer, which you can watch below, doesn't give much away, and we've had to wait four months to get new info on the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over at the time of this writing, ending just hours prior to this post, and as far as we know right now, we won't get another chance to play it until it launches this coming October 10, 2025. But if you can't wait that long and want more Battlefield right now, EA has released a new update for Battlefield 2042 to help tide you over until October.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">Update 9.2</a> for Battlefield 2042 adds a new fan-favorite map to the 2021 release, Iwo Jima, a map that is new to the last major release in the Battlefield series, but veterans of the shooter will recognize from multiple entries, including Battlefield V, Battlefield 1942, and Battlefield 1943. You'll enter the fight from the sea with boat landings, and jump into close-quarters fighting in the bunkers and trenches with an active volcano in the background to complete the grandeur of Iwo Jima.</p>



<p>The update also includes two new weapons and vehicles for players to check out: the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. The two new vehicles are two new fighter jets, the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot.</p>

</figure>



<p>Along with the new map, weapons, and vehicles, EA is also adding a free battle pass that runs right up to Battlefield 6's release, titled the Road to Battlefield Battle Pass, which includes 60 tiers of cosmetics for players to earn, celebrating previous Battlefield titles stretching all the way back to Battlefield Bad Company 2.</p>



<p>There's also a bevy of bug fixes and balance changes included in the update, and though EA doesn't specify what the rewards will be, the company does say that players who dig into the new content added in this update will "<em>unlock exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards</em>."</p>



<p>We've still got a while to wait for Battlefield 6's launch, but if you're really craving a bit of what we saw these last two weekends, then this new update, along with the rest of the content already available in Battlefield 2042, will help you get your fix until October 10.</p>

              <p>An August Nintendo Direct is indeed happening, though maybe not the one fans were expecting. The company announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">a deep dive into <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is coming on August 19, the same day that Gamescom kicks off in Germany. We basically know nothing about the upcoming racer except that Kirby creator and <em>Smash Bros.</em> director Masahiro Sakurai is in charge, and it’s scheduled to arrive before the end of 2025.</p> <p>“Tune in on Tuesday, August 19, for a livestreamed <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game,” Nintendo posted in its Switch 2 news app today. Nearly an hour about <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>? In this economy?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The game was originally revealed during the Switch 2’s April Nintendo Direct, but with only a cinematic teaser and Sakurai’s name flashing across the screen. It’s a sequel to the 2003 GameCube fan-favorite, which included, among other things, the novel mechanic of players not needing to hold a button to accelerate. But it was also largely overshadowed on a console that already had <em>F-Zero GX</em> and <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>.</p>

 <p>The new <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> falls into a similar position with the Switch 2, coming so soon after <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>F-Zero</em> via the Switch Online retro library, and the great indie launch racer<em> Fast Fusion</em>. Expectations are also markedly higher for exclusives featuring first-party characters in the Switch 2 era, though <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a joint venture between Sakurai’s studio and Bandai Namco.</p> <p>The upcoming game is supposed to round out Nintendo’s holiday release lineup, though we’re still waiting on the release date for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, a game that was originally teased back during the first years of the Switch 1’s life cycle. A <em>Kirby</em> Direct probably wasn’t on most fans’ bingo cards for August, but hopefully a big Nintendo Direct that helps define the longer-term roadmap for the Switch 2 will still be coming soon.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is taking center stage at the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, announced for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Due for release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year, Kirby Air Riders is the first new game in the franchise since 2022’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land and is one of the big remaining Switch 2 launches this year.</p>



<p>The latest Nintendo Direct continues the approach of focusing on a single game rather than several titles, an approach already seen this year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-revealed-during-mario-kart-world-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-by-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and plenty of details are set to be revealed.</p>

<p>In a social media <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1957427985625088145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo announced the Kirby Air Raiders Direct would take place on August 19 at 6am PT/8am CT/9am ET/2pm BST/11pm AEST.</p>



<p>The announcement stated the livestream presentation will “last 45 minutes” and provides an “in-depth look” at the title, releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>A social media <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a> for Kirby Air Riders then went live, which will share the “latest announcements and updates” for the title, which will likely be extremely active following the Nintendo Direct showcase.</p>



<p>Details on exactly what will be shown are unknown, though it’s highly likely that a release date will be provided given we’re approaching the latter end of 2025 and details so far have not been shared.</p>



<p>Further reveals from Nintendo for Switch 2 could be on the cards this week at Gamescom, where the company’s attendance is confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," claims modder.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A modder has created a solution for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</u></a> PC players unhappy with the recent changes introduced in Patch 1.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, developer Leenzee Games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-wuchang-fallen-feathers-dev-admits-performance-issues-should-never-have-occurred"><u>promised fans</u></a> that a number of performance and optimization issues plaguing the game since launch were on the way. And while Patch 1.5 does address many of these issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-performance-patch-makes-drastic-changes-to-enemies-and-story-and-players-arent-happy"><u>it also made sweeping, and unexpected, changes to many of the game's enemies, dialogue, and story</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explained at the time, prior to the patch, you were able to target and kill certain human NPCs you encountered throughout the game. These characters were passive and didn't attack you, but murdering them affected your character's "madness" mechanic. That's no longer the case, however — the NPCs are untargetable and unkillable, effectively removing the ability to choose to interact with the madness mechanic in that specific way, and you cannot kill boss enemies any longer, but only "exhaust" them into surrendering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the changes have not been well received, and many players have taken to Steam's discussion forums and user review section to share their disappointment. And within days of 1.5's release, a modder has already created a mod that rolls back the changes wholesale, be they for the better or worse, to version 1.4.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience - Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story-advancing dialog from the original game," the modder <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "Basically, patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod creator themselves admitted it's a "fairly complex mod that modifies game files," and as it also undoes some of the QoL improvements introduced in Patch 1.5, they point some players who want to rollback the story changes but keep QoL changes to additional mods like <a href="https://https//www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/136" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Vertical Traversal</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Improved Recovery</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/124" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Item Pick Up</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses. Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
