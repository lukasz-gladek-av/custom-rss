<p>Prime Video is shaping up to receive another banger of a live-action adaptation later this year, with the sudden announcement that a Like a Dragon: Yakuza series is heading to the platform in October. This reveal came out of nowhere, shocking fans worldwide and drawing an immediate sentiment of anticipation, given the recent success of the series and Prime’s adaptations thus far (I’m looking at you, Fallout).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sudden-strike">Sudden Strike</h2>



<p>RGG Studio took to social media to share an image promoting the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series for the first time with almost nothing in the way of a preface. It was a simple drop that stunned audiences, with RGG offering a date and a platform – October 24 on Prime Video.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make the choice to take the next step. Like a Dragon: Yakuza comes to Prime Video October 24. <a href="https://t.co/Pn2gKQzqlK">pic.twitter.com/Pn2gKQzqlK</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1797826081166184839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s a live-action adaptation starring Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, the iconic lead of the series and one of gaming’s suavest and most capable fighters. Takeuchi is best known for his voice work and live-action roles in productions hailing almost exclusively from Japan, and his career thus far has been contained almost solely to a string of television shows.</p>



<p>Fans have had a mixed reception to the casting, but many agree that they’ll wait and see Takeuchi in the role of Kiryu before they pass judgment.</p>

Made in Japan, the series stars the hugely popular Japanese drama and stage actor Ryoma Takeuchi in the role of Kazuma Kiryu. </p><p>Like a Dragon: Yakuza will be available on Amazon Prime in over 240 countries and territories worldwide, released in two batches on October 25 and November 1, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><h2>A new story loosely based on the original Yakuza</h2><p>The live-action crime-suspense series is based on an original screenplay loosely inspired by the first game in the series, 2005’s Yakuza. It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005. </p><p>Similar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show’s press release as a “fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity”, and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include “​​intense fighting scenes”, alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.</p><p>The series was announced today at a press conference at the picturesque Hotel Gajoen Tokyo. At the event, Takeuchi and Take discussed the process of adapting the acclaimed game series for a live-action drama. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/yakuza-show-1717470220217.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Director Masaharu Take and actor Ryoma Takeuchi at today's announcement.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of the tattoo on his back and sculpting his body for the role, as seen in the key visual image released today, Takeuchi said, “You can’t play Kiryu Kazuma without getting into shape, so I knew I had to throw myself into it. This was a job not only for me but also for the costume and makeup teams. It took two and a half hours just to prepare for this shot.”</p><p>He added, “It’s partly Kiryu Kazuma and it’s partly me. I got so close to the part that it was hard to distinguish where he ended and I began. That included getting into shape for the part, the costume and so on. Rather than acting the part of Kiryu, I feel like he became part of the family.”</p><p>Director Take said, “Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.”</p><p>Of Kiryu’s place in the story, Take said, “In 1995, the protagonist is still young and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he gets out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.”</p><p>Taking their positions in front of a golden folding screen emblazoned with a dragon reminiscent of the tattoo on Kiryu’s back, the actor and director made a symbolic prayer for the show’s success.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/img-8734-1717470697624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ryoma Takeuchi will star as iconic Yakuza character Kiryu Kazuma in the upcoming series.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Meet the new Kazuka Kiryu</h2><p>Takeuchi broke through with his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in multiple Kamen Rider projects. His credits include a cameo in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review">2019’s Detective Pikachu movie adaptation as a Pokémon trainer</a>, as well as providing the voice for Justice Smith’s character Tim Goodman in the Japanese dub. He also has a successful career in stage acting, and before that was a budding soccer player.</p><p>In a press release, Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and executive producer of the new drama series, said, “While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show.”</p><p>The Like a Dragon game series is developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega. The first game, upon which the Amazon series will be partly based, was released in 2006 in the West, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/06/yakuza-review"><u>with IGN praising its story and awarding it 8.2/10</u></a>. The game spawned a globally successful franchise, with multiple sequels and spinoffs, a movie adaptation directed by Takashi Miike in 2007, and a remake of the first game titled Yakuza Kiwami in 2016. </p><p>The series was renamed Like a Dragon in 2022, and the most recent entry, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, was released globally in January 2024, receiving 9/10 scores from both IGN and IGN Japan.</p><p><em>Daniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

Directed by the critically acclaimed Masaharu Take, the series will feature Ryoma Takeuchi as the lead character, Kazuma Kiryu. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> is the latest addition to the Prime membership. Prime members in Japan enjoy savings, convenience, and entertainment, all in a single membership.</p><p>Released in 2005 by SEGA, the <em>Yakuza</em> game series was positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience. The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamurocho, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward’s Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. The much-loved game has captured the attention and hearts of fans not only in Japan but also internationally and will now be adapted, developed, and streamed worldwide on Prime Video. </p><p>In 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time-periods, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, an original <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>■ Cast and Staff Comments</strong></p><p><strong>Ryoma Takeuchi, Kazuma Kiryu Actor</strong></p><p>“I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series. I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. Audience will enjoy the show’s human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look Kiryu’s intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.”</p><p><strong>Masaharu Take, Director</strong></p><p>“I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>. The unbridled passion, talent, and countless hours of efforts from the entire team have helped bring this spectacular story to life in the form of a riveting series that will be launched this year, the year of the dragon. Please look forward to Kazuma Kiryu, played by Ryoma Takeuchi.”</p><p><strong>James Farrell, Head of International Originals, Amazon MGM Studios</strong></p><p>“We are thrilled and extremely excited to announce the Amazon Original action-drama <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, based on the popular Japanese game series. The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch. We are committed to augmenting our content library and are confident that <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will strike a chord with audiences all over the world.”</p><p><strong><a title="People > Masayoshi Yokoyama [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/people/masayoshi-yokoyama">Masayoshi Yokoyama</a>, Producer and Studio Head, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</strong></p><p>“Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original <em>Yakuza</em>‘s script, I’ve never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It’s because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I’d want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could—and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will become another landmark release for the <em>Like a Dragon</em> series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I’m sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I’d love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world—experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="7e50o5">Many moons ago, Hariyama was pretty relevant to the meta as a fighting-type Pokémon, but it has since been overtaken by Pokémon like Lucario, Conkeldurr, Terrakion, and others. However, Hariyama is still pretty good if you have a shadow Hariyama, so if you have a shadow Makuhita, you should consider holding on to it and powering it up.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Makuhita in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Makuhita is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>

                <p>NZXT revealed some new components at Computex 2024 this week. These include a fresh incarnation of its highly popular H7 Flow mid-tower case, single-frame fans designed with ease-of-use in mind, and a new generation of ATX 3.1 power supplies.</p><p dir="ltr">The NZXT single-frame fans are designed as an alternative to multiple fan cables, serving as two or three fan arrays in one eight-pin cable that has both PWM and RGB. However, you may need a splitter for it to work on a traditional motherboard fan port, as it also comes with 5V ARGB. NZXT plans to roll out a "control hub" that will directly manage these fans with ease in Q3 of 2024.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312127" data-ratio="1" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312127"></a><figcaption>The revamped H7 Flow layout prioritizes airflow to the GPU, and it's also easier to get into without using a screwdriver.  </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4312127-h52.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Finally, NZXT is introducing the C-Series Gold and Platinum PSUs, which are available in 850W, 1000W, and 1200W variations. They have been redesigned to maximize airflow and reduce noise, and they're also available in white for those of you who like to match up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just three months after releasing its first gaming handheld PC to damning reviews — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">here’s mine</a> — MSI is already announcing a likely replacement. The “MSI Claw 8 AI Plus” swaps its lackluster Intel Meteor Lake chip for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">the brand-new Lunar Lake ones</a>, while replacing its 7-inch, 1080p 120Hz variable resolution rate screen for a larger 8-inch one.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, it will boast up to an 80 watt-hour battery, MSI tells<em> The Verge</em> — tying it with the recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">Asus ROG Ally X</a> for biggest battery in a PC gaming handheld. Despite the larger screen, it’ll still offer a smooth 120Hz refresh rate with VRR, writes MSI marketing specialist Anne Lee. </p><p>The Claw will also offer a second USB-C port with Thunderbolt 4 capabilities, just like the Asus, will come with a wall-mounted charger instead of the two-cord brick of the original, and will have enhanced “tactile feel of the LB/RB buttons.”</p><p>MSI didn’t provide any other details or a single image of the new handheld, only telling us that the company would release more info <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168856/computex-2024-convention-news-announcements">at Computex</a> — the PC show that’s currently underway in Taipei, Taiwan. But we know as of today that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">Intel’s Lunar Lake has up to 50 percent more GPU performance</a> than Meteor Lake and its Xe2 GPU needs less power for the same performance — though Intel doesn’t label its chart axes, so we have no clue how much.</p><div><figcaption><em>“Meteor Lake H” is the chip that was in the original MSI Claw.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>MSI did announce <em>another</em> version of the Claw today: a limited-edition <em>Fallout</em> version that looks a tad like the game’s Pip-Boy wrist computers, but is unfortunately based on the original 7-inch MSI Claw with Meteor Lake, not Lunar Lake. So unless there’s a lot of utterly diehard<em> Fallout</em> + Claw fans, I expect that one will be similarly dead on arrival. Still, MSI’s press release says it will have “the largest battery in the industry,” so maybe it’ll have a surprise or two inside?</p><p>In case you’re wondering, yes, I have been retesting the original MSI Claw with the newest BIOS and sets of drivers, and I’m not yet finding enough of a performance boost to change my recommendation at all.</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 4th: </strong>Jacob Roach of Digital Trends </em><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/"><em>has pics of the Lunar Lake version</em></a><em> — and it’s a complete redesign with an M.2 2280 slot for longer SSDs that’s coming in September. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-monolith-troubled-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amongst the list of major upcoming AAA titles, few are more mysterious than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman title</a> in the works at Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/monolith-productions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions</a>. The game was first announced back in 2021, and since then, we’ve heard very little about it. With “E3” season ramping up, some might be hoping we’ll finally get a real look at the game, but according to a new rumor, that’s unlikely.</p>
<p>This rumor comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2kJQjUgT_QY?si=YyVMNSSzLBCp75a0&amp;t=2539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courtesy of Kinda Funny’s Greg Miller</a>, who doesn’t usually do the insider thing, but is unquestionably a well-connected figure in the industry. Per Miller, he’s heard from an insider that the Wonder Woman game is “troubled,” and probably isn’t going to be seen anytime too soon, as he doesn’t believe it’s “ready for prime time.”</p>
<p><em>“In the past year, because I'll leave it ambiguous, I've talked to an insider, who was, like, "this game's troubled." That's all I'll say. So, I don't hold out hope that it's in a place to show something. [...] I think it's not where they want it to be, I don't think it's ready for prime time.”</em></p>
<p>The premise of a Wonder Woman game built by Monolith using their trademark Nemesis System has always felt a bit odd, so it’s not too hard to believe development may be troubled. That said, as always with rumors, take them with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Last year, following rumors the Wonder Woman game would be a live service title, Warner Bros. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-is-a-single-player-game-not-designed-for-live-service-says-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified it would be a single-player adventure</a>, providing the following brief description…</p>
<p><em>“Wonder Woman is a single-player action-adventure game set in a dynamic open world. This third-person experience will allow players to become Diana of Themyscira and introduce an original story set in the DC Universe while also featuring the Nemesis System. Wonder Woman is not being designed as a live service.”</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release window for Wonder Woman have yet to be announced. What do you think? Can Monolith pull a worthy Wonder Woman game together?</p>

                <p>Last month, on May 14,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-names-two-playstation-ceos-says-ps5-growth-is-likely-over/1100-6523439/"> Sony named Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst</a> the new CEOs of PlayStation. Recently, both Nishino and Hulst shared why they believe having two CEOs is the best move for PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Their statement came from an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-exciting-future-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SIE blog post</a>. In it, they explain that the "PlayStation community is at the heart of everything" the company does. The two go on to explain how they plan on operating going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">"We believe it's never been more important for the leadership at SIE to step back, review our business holistically, and move forward with a new structure designed to bring out the best in the organization and deliver increasingly incredible experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">As the post continued, Nishino and Hulst shared an email to Sony employees. Near the end of it, the two give their opinion on why having both on board is the best move going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">"While having two CEOs is a new structure for SIE, we know this will foster greater creativity and innovation as we look for new ways to grow the business, always keeping our community at the forefront.

		<p>Geoff Keighley’s Summer Games fest kicks on on June 7th and ahead of the show he took to Twitch for a Q &amp; A session, during which he tempered expectations for the show. “There will be, definitely, new announcements,” he said, “but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.”</p>
<p>“There definitely are things that are being announced but this is not a show that has a lot of like ‘coming in 2026’ or ‘2027’, or teasers for games that are years and years out… That’s generally what I would say in terms of expectation setting.”</p>


<p>So lets start with some of what will be shown. Metaphor: Refantazio and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wild/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> are confirmed, along with indie games made “single devs”. Also in the show will be Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance and a trailer for some “cool DLC.”.&nbsp; Batman: Arkham VR from Camoflaj is also confirmed along with Dragon Ball Sparking ZERO and a trailer for the Among Us animated show.</p>
<p>He confirmed the following titles will not be present: Beyond Good and Evil 2 , Five Nights At Freddy’s, Grand Theft Auto 6, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Kingdom Hearts 4, Wolf Among Us 2, Judas, or Metal Gear Solid Delta. There will also be no Muppets (boo!) and no music acts (yay!).</p>

<p>The show will begin at 10pm BST on June 7th and run for two hours, it will be followed by the day of Devs indie show for an hour, then the always wacky Devolver show at 1am,</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like PlayStation VR2 is having quite the same success as its predecessor, which was a runaway hit at a moment when public curiosity and investment in VR were at an all-time high. Nonetheless, it's one of the most advanced VR headsets available—tied to a tiny library on the PS5.</p>
<p>That's about to change, as Sony has confirmed its plans to launch a PC adapter for the headset on August 7. It will cost $60, and it will, at a minimum, let PSVR2 owners play a large library of SteamVR titles, provided their PCs meet the minimum specifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">Sony's blog post</a> about the adapter says players will need a Steam account, so it's unclear how or whether you can use the headset to dive into PC VR experiences through various channels besides Steam.</p>
<p>In addition to the PSVR2 headset, its controllers, and the new adapter, you'll need a DisplayPort 1.4-compatible cable and the following PC specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or 11 64-bit</li>
<li>Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 or later</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 or later, or Nvidia RTX series, or AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later, or AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li>
<li>RTX 3060 or later or RX 6000XT or later are recommended "for the best performance"</li>
<li>Bluetooth 4.0 or later.</li>
</ul>                                            
                                                        
<p>Users will have to install SteamVR, and there will be a PlayStation VR2 app as well.</p>
<p>All that sounds exciting if you bought a PSVR2 but are really feeling the dearth of content on the PlayStation platform. (PSVR2 isn't compatible with the large library of PSVR1 games, and several flagship VR titles still haven't been updated for it.)</p>
<p>But a lot of the cool features that make PSVR2 so great won't actually work on PC, Sony says. That includes "HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble)."</p>
<p>That's rather frustrating, because some of those features have shown up in the highest-end PC VR headsets that have been announced.
</p><p>Sony notes that "the high-fidelity and sensory immersion features of PS VR2 are supported, including 4K visuals (2000×2040 per eye), 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, and see-through view, as well as foveated rendering (without eye tracking) and 3D Audio in supported games."</p>
<p>All told, it's still a relatively strong offering, superior to the numerous Oculus Rift S headsets that are still circulating out there. We'll have to wait and see what barriers exist to running non-Steam content when it arrives later this summer.</p>

		<p>Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/">Little Nightmares III</a> will no longer be released this year and has been delayed until an unspecified date in 2025.</p>
<p>“As much as we can’t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way,” reads a statement posted on Twitter.</p>


<p>“We’ll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.”</p>

<p>Supermassive Games have taken over development duties from Tarsier Studios for this third instalment. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first to games it is set in a completely different location, Nightmares 1 and 2 were set in The Maw.</p>

<p>The game will be playable from end to end in online co-op mode, or if you prefer you can play solo and have an AI companion help you out.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Little Nightmares II review, I said,<em> “It’s rather obvious, but if enjoyed the first Little Nightmares then you will enjoy the Little Nightmares II. While some new elements have been added it is more of a next chapter to the story than a full blown sequel. The attention detail is incredible, bringing the story to life without a single spoken word. It’s unsettling, creepy, darkly amusing, and at times a little frustrating, but immensely enjoyable. Another little, slime covered gem from Tarsier Studios.”</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III is coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

This has added to concerns over the kind of access Google employees have to videos before they go live, an issue highlighted in recent reports from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/"><em>Insider Gaming</em>’s Tom Henderson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1796298547647635940"><em>404 Media</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>One incident, as noted by Henderson, occurred in 2022 when KSI attempted to give away over $10,000 in Amazon gift cards. However, <a href="https://x.com/KSI/status/1596643151980134405">KSI later realized</a> that all of the gift card codes had been redeemed before the video was posted, sparking an internal investigation at YouTube. The company reportedly started a similar investigation after the trailer for <em>GTA VI</em> leaked, but it’s not clear whether it’s related.</p><p>All of this ties into what seems like an ongoing problem at Google. On Monday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/"><em>404 Media</em> published reports</a> based on Google’s internal database records, and it found that a <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/">Google contractor was behind</a> the 2017 Nintendo leak that offered an early look at <em>Yoshi’s Crafted World</em>.</p><p>At the time, a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe">Reddit shared an image</a> of the trailer just before its reveal at E3. The image contained an “admin.youtube.com” URL in the address bar, suggesting that an employee accessed the private version of the video.</p><p>Google confirmed that an employee accessed the information in a database entry viewed by <em>404 Media</em>. “Google employee deliberately leaked private Nintendo information,” the entry said. “Former TVC [temporary vendor contractor] download video with admin account, and shared unreleased Nintendo feature with friend.” The entry also reportedly said the incident was “non-intentional.”</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Google spokesperson Matt Bryant says every flag reported by <em>404 Media</em> “was reviewed and resolved at that time.” However, the company didn’t elaborate on what it does to prevent employees from accessing and leaking content early.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s the basic premise of <em>Turbo Trip.</em> You are Tiny Terry and after lying to get a job with a taxi company, you get a car. It’s now your job to go around collecting junk and cash to help you upgrade your taxi cab and make it go faster and faster. If you upgrade it all the way, you can drive it up a giant building and into space. Probably. That’s the plan, at least. And that’s your goal in <em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip.</em>&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, to get all the junk and cash needed to max out your taxi and reach outer space, you’ll need to explore a delightfully colorful and zany open-world filled with characters to help and collectibles to find. Right away, <em>Turbo Trip</em>’s cartoon visuals impressed me. Even on a Steam Deck, the game looks marvelous, like a trippy, vivid Saturday morning cartoon directed by Weird Al.<br></p><p>Each character I met in this odd world was a misshapen lump of bright color and limbs. Even better, they all made me laugh, often because they didn’t know how to react to Tiny Terry. His bizarre antics and dedication to being the weirdest one in the room lead to some of the best awkward pauses I’ve ever experienced in a video game.<br></p><p>I also appreciated that, for as weird and wild as <em>Turbo Trip </em>gets, it never feels like it’s doing things just to be random. It still feels like a (somewhat) real world with genuine people living in it. Even Terry has his moments of genuine growth and care. This all helps the game avoid the trap of being a collection of internet memes and bad jokes haphazardly stitched together, something other comedy games can often feel like. There’s depth here.<br></p><p>But great writing, colorful visuals, silly antics, and a nice lead character aren’t enough to make a great game. You also need to have fun playing it, and <em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em> excels at that, too.</p><p>It feels lazy, but the best way to describe this game is: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run"><em>Simpsons: Hit And Run</em></a></span>, but without the copyrighted characters. Like <em>Hit and Run</em>, in <em>Turbo Trip</em> you explore a large but not massive open world filled with random junk (in this case, literal junk) to collect. Sometimes the junk is just sitting around. Other times it’s hidden in out-of-the-way locations. Like <em>Hit And Run</em>, you do light platforming to reach these places while also completing silly quests for townsfolk which often involve driving and jumping around the city. Also like <em>Hit And Run</em>, you can hop into any NPC’s car and ride about town as a passenger.<br></p><p><em>Turbo Trip</em> actually expands on <em>Hit And Run</em> by adding more upgrades you can unlock as you play, like a glider and different weapons. (Oh, don’t worry, there’s no combat in this game. You just use weapons to break open boxes or annoy random NPCs.) I also greatly prefer running and driving in <em>Turbo Trip</em> as platforming genuinely feels nice and is super responsive compared to the stiffer controls in<em> Hit And Run</em> and even some other big open-world games out there. (Looking at you <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>…)<br></p><p><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em> will likely take you less than four hours to complete, though if you try to do and collect everything it might take closer to six. Either way, you’re in for an awesome and funny open-world comedy game that <em>actually </em>made me laugh a lot and which is a dream to play. It might not be<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958"><em>Hit And Run 2</em></a></span><em>,</em> but it’s a damn fine game on its own. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Tactical Hologram bosses are the most difficult content you can tackle in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. There are four bosses total, so if you’re looking to tackle them from easiest to hardest, here they all are ranked.</p> <h2 id="h-all-tactical-hologram-bosses-ranked-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">All Tactical Hologram Bosses Ranked in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Right before I jump into the ranking process, understand that the difficulty of boss encounters in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> depends on several factors, with one of the largest being personal skill. As such, this ranking is based entirely on my own skill level, which may be lesser or greater than yours. For a little context, I am currently on Difficulty 6 on every one of the Tactical Hologram bosses so far, so the rankings will be based on Level 5. I believe this still pretty much paints the same picture, however. Disclaimer over. The following ranks are from <strong>easiest to hardest</strong>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-impermanence-heron" data-injectable="false">Impermanence Heron</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Tactical-Hologram-Ranked-Heron.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">This deranged death bird is the easiest of the Tactical Hologram bosses because its patterns are simple to understand. There is little complication to any of the Impermanence Heron’s attacks, and if you die to it, you very clearly get why. Its attacks have massively obvious tells (minus a certain sidestep wing sweep move) making it easy to read for counterplay. </p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">Additionally, this overgrown bird is quite slow, allowing you plenty of time to react to it. It has very few parry windows that matter, and each one is easy to land once you’ve got the timing down for them. Overall, an easy boss. Most people shouldn’t struggle too much up to about Difficulty 4, but that’s only because all of the Tactical Hologram bosses get much harder then.</p> <h3 id="h-feilian-beringal" data-injectable="false"><strong>Feilian Beringal</strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wuthering-Waves-Tactical-Hologram-Ranked-Feilian.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">This giant ape is a bit harder than the Impermance Heron, due to being faster and more relentless with its continuous attacks. However, for most people, Feilian Berginal’s speed won’t be much of an issue due to how telegraphed its attacks are. All of them have large wind-ups, so you have plenty of time to react, and they’re often so large that they straight-up miss you if you don’t do anything. </p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">What puts this ape over the Heron in difficulty is its seemingly large health pool and log-spin attack. First, Feilian Beringal has a lot of health to burn through to beat the timer, meaning you need to be fishing for counterattacks every chance you get, especially at lower gear levels. Early on, I found this aspect of the monkey to be the hardest part to deal with. </p> <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true">However, Feilian Beringal also has a special attack he performs on occasion when he gets access to his log. He will begin to spin around rapidly for about ten seconds, in which, during this time <strong>he can one-shot you if any portion of it hits you.</strong> What makes this move particularly dangerous is that the animation of the spin does not match the actual hurt-box that can, well, hurt you, meaning you can die to an attack you cannot see. The best counter for this is to literally spam dodge during the spin attack, and counterattack after each one. The extended i-frames from the counter will allow you to survive the entire animation, and you get more damage out of it.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mourning-aix" data-injectable="false">Mourning Aix</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="788" data-injectable="true">Oof. I have a lot to say about this boss. Rough around the edges doesn’t even begin to describe it, because this monstrosity has so many glitches, camera bugs, and one-shot mechanics that, when all combined together, make this one of the hardest bosses in the entire game. Mourning Aix is no joke even without all the bugs, as everything it does is just generally annoying. This monster constantly mixes slow, easy-to-spot attacks with lightning-fast ones that catch you off guard. </p>
 <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Worse, this beast spams a cyclonic blade swarm attack that requires you to <strong>memorize which</strong> <strong>attack it used before it</strong>, to understand how many times you need to press your dodge button, otherwise you die. Not joking. It literally uses different variants of this move depending on that. Generally speaking, you want to parry <strong>every single one of its parry-able attacks</strong>, as it reduces the frequency of cyclonic blade swarms you’ll have to deal with. Trust me when I say, it’s worth the trouble. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more important those parry windows become.</p>
 <h3 id="h-thundering-mephis" data-injectable="false">Thundering Mephis</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Thundering Mephis is easily the most difficult boss in <em>Wuthering Waves </em>as a hologram. This boss is extremely fast, and constantly barrages you with kill moves that require very fast reaction times to avoid. On top of this, the boss disappears constantly, reducing your overall DPS on him unless you parry his attacks on an equally consistent basis. I’d say that this boss is nearly impossible to kill in time if you don’t parry most of his moves, currently.</p>
 <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">What truly makes this boss a nightmare is its infuriating clone that it spawns at random while attacking you. The clone can appear at a moment’s notice, and attack with lightning speed. It can appear off the edge of your screen and blast you while you focus on the main body. It can unleash Thunder Mephis’s mass AoE instant kill move, while the main body blasts you from off-screen. There are just so many combination attacks that clutter the scene that it’s often hard to tell what even happening. You’re dealing with this <strong>while dealing with relentless attacks of Thunder Mephis, constantly.</strong> Everything both the main body and clone do can one-shot you. All it takes is one tap, and you’re done. </p>
 <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">If this wasn’t enough for you, then know that you can parry the clone’s attacks. Normally, you’re rewarded for doing this, but if you manage to pull off this feat, even by accident <strong>you’re frozen in place, camera and all, and are unable to dodge, swap characters,</strong> or<strong> generally defend yourself</strong> for about one second. This is enough time for Thundering Mephis to outright kill you. Part of me thinks this is another bug, but, honestly, I’m not even sure.</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">What I am sure of, though, is that there is no more difficult boss than this monster in <em>Wuthering Waves.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-dev-reveals-must-use-vector-loadout-to-dominate-lobbies.888708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-dev-reveals-must-use-vector-loadout-to-dominate-lobbies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-dev-reveals-must-use-vector-loadout-to-dominate-lobbies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Out of the four SMGs currently available in <em>XDefiant</em>, public perception leans toward the MP7 being the best option. However, <em>XDefiant </em>developer ACHES pointed out the Vector as his favorite and provided a set of attachments that will help you elevate your game to another level. </p> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">During <em>XDefiant’s </em>three-year development period, few people have had more time playing the free-to-play title than ACHES, who joined Ubisoft as a game developer to help finish the project. The former <em>Call of Duty</em> world champion is no stranger to dominating FPS titles, and he has an inside scoop on which weapons perform best. Consensus highlights the MP7 as the best SMG in <em>XDefiant</em>, but statistics tell a different story. </p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">According to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the Vector has the fastest time-to-kill speed among all SMGS up to 13 meters at 300 milliseconds. In comparison, the MP7 clocks in at 345 ms. In saying that, the Vector does suffer a major drop-off after the first initial 13 meters, while the other SMGs remain relatively consistent. But for anything after that first damage range you are better off using an AR anyways, so this knock shouldn’t be too much of a deterrent. </p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Another downside is the Vector’s relatively small magazine size, which holds 25 rounds. In comparison, the P90 can hold 50 rounds but does kill slightly slower. To compensate for that deficiency, ACHES upped that ammo count and made a few other modifications that make this SMG lethal in any short-range engagement. </p> <h2 id="h-best-vector-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best Vector loadout in XDefiant </h2> <p data-characters="138" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">XDefiant posted ACHES’ Vector loadout on <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1797704813238534428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, and the loadout received a warm reception from players with similar class setups. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Legend says that in order to play like the pros, you have to use their build. 🧙‍♂️</p><p>Well, our resident pro ACHES gave us a sneak peak at his build to get you all those juicy 20-bombs. <a href="https://t.co/8hO4XzAIVF">pic.twitter.com/8hO4XzAIVF</a></p></div>— XDefiant (@PlayXDefiant) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1797704813238534428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Chrome Lined</li> <li><strong>Front Rail:</strong> Superlight </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Extended Mag</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Quick Draw</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Lightweight </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Extended Mag</strong> is arguably the most important attachment, as it increases the magazine size from 25 rounds to 40. Next, the <strong>Chrome Lined barrel </strong>improves short—and long-range damage at the cost of ADS time and sprint speed. To compensate for that mobility loss, the <strong>Quick Draw Grip </strong>improves ADS time and sprint to fire time. In addition, the <strong>Lightweight rear grip</strong> helps recoup lost sprint and ADS movement speed. And then to round off the loadout, the <strong>Superlight</strong> grip also improves ADS time and sprint speed to lean into the weapon’s short-range strengths. </p>

<p data-characters="158" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Rumors alleged that <em>XDefiant </em>movement mechanics could be hindered in Season 1, but Ubisoft’s Mark Rubin quickly stepped in and put those claims to bed. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Landon Apollo <a href="https://x.com/ApollosMission/status/1797667601323319647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that mid-air directional movement and strafing would be removed from <em>XDefiant</em> Season 1, along with a nerf to bunny hopping. Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1797669418321031374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “I’m pretty sure that’s not true. And I know a guy on the inside.” </p> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm pretty sure that's not true. And I know a guy on the inside.</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1797669418321031374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">That isn’t to say there won’t aren’t any movement changes coming down the pipeline. <em>XDefiant</em> developer ACHES <a href="https://x.com/ACHES/status/1794809866155970682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the team intends to punish players for repeated jumps and crouches by adding aiming sway. Ubisoft doesn’t want to restrict players from using any of the free-to-play shooters’ mechanics, but ACHES argued that there is a sweet spot between intended use and spam. As for when this update will go live, On May 25, the <em>XDefiant</em> developer <a href="https://x.com/ACHES/status/1794560550061359177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> fans that the update would be added in soon. </p>
 <p data-characters="672" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">If players had a chance to play the <em>XDefiant</em> close beta in 2023, they would have had an opportunity to see the aim sway penalty in action. If a player jumped consecutively too many times in a row, their weapon would shake back and forth, making it hard to quickly line up a shot on an enemy. So even though there won’t be any substantial movement changes coming, players will have to readjust their plans once this patch goes out. Currently, most players like to use their momentum from a slide into a jump to catch an enemy off guard. Once jumping gets nerfed, players will have to be more cautious about the movement feature and pick their spots with more intent. </p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Movement speed is always a contentious topic in FPS titles, and there will inevitably be a frustrated segment of the player base, regardless of how much of a difference this impending change makes. But if you are sick of getting killed by enemies jumping around you, there is at least a little bit of relief coming, even if it isn’t wide-sweeping.</p>

<p data-characters="194" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We finally have a preview of the newest character coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em>: Emilie, a perfumist from Fontaine. Here’s everything we know about Emilie so far, from her element to her backstory.</p> <h2 id="h-emilie-s-element-and-details" data-injectable="false">Emilie’s element and details</h2> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">Emilie is a Dendro character from Fontaine. Her Vision shape tells us that she has a Pneuma alignment. We can’t see her weapon or rarity from her character art, so we’ll have to wait for her kit details before we find out.</p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Emilie’s Constellation is called Pomum de Ambra, which is Latin for “apple of amber.” This is another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomander" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pomanders</a> – accessories used during the Middle Ages and Renaissance for carrying perfumes.</p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">As a perfumist, Emilie creates a dazzling variety of perfumes for Fontanians to wear. <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/29444651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Neuvillette</a>, these scents aren’t purely for aesthetics. Some of them have aroma-therapeutic properties and can help regulate mood.</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">Oddly enough, Emilie’s drip marketing preview also includes mention of a “forensic cleaner.” It’s unclear if Emilie is actually a forensic cleaner as well as a perfumist. It may simply be a reference to how Emilie helps eradicate bad smells by covering them up with pleasant ones.</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">While we haven’t met Emilie before in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, she’s been mentioned in the past. Lyney, Lynette, and Wriothesley have voice lines about Emilie, and Chevreuse has mentioned being friends with Emilie during previous in-game events.</p> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-emilie-coming-to-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">When is Emilie coming to <em>Genshin Impact</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Given the timing of her announcement, we can expect Emilie to make her debut during <em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 4.8. If <em>Genshin’s</em> current <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-roadmap-and-update-schedule-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update schedule</a> holds, Version 4.8 should drop on <strong>July 17</strong>, with more character information being revealed in the weeks leading up to that date.</p> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="false">While we patiently wait for Emilie, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-version-4-7-release-date-new-characters-primogem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Version 4.7</a> has plenty of new characters and events to keep us occupied, including a brand new game mode.</p>

  <p id="iaRPM6"><em>Digital Combat Simulator World</em>, also known as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/24/21080712/flight-simulation-shmup-dcs-warthog-bullet-hell"><em>DCS World</em></a>, is the reigning champion of combat flight simulation software. From the P-51 Mustang to the beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/2/21499259/dcs-warthog-a-10c-2-early-access-release-date-price-upgrade">A-10 Warthog</a>, the platform is full to bursting with top-tier interpretations of famous airframes — many that simply can’t be flown elsewhere digitally. And while developer Eagle Dynamics’ attention to detail has gotten them in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/15/18623545/eagle-dynamics-f-16-manual-conspiracy-smuggling-russia">hot water</a> before, its first- and third-party developers routinely deliver the goods. Its latest, <em>DCS: F-4E Phantom II</em> by partners <a href="https://store.heatblur.com/">Heatblur Simulations</a>, looks absolutely amazing — especially considering it plays best as a two-player cooperative experience.</p>
<p id="ZgWs07">I’ll admit that I’m a bit of a fanboy of the F-4. I even have a vintage Remove Before Flight tag from a United States Air Force Phantom hanging here in my office. But I’ve never actually flown the airplane before on PC. Looking over the initial launch video, which officially came out on May 22, I was absolutely intimidated. Not for the reason that you’re probably thinking of — I’m pretty sure I could get it off the ground and make it perform. But it’s a two-seater airplane. That means I’d be flying with the game’s AI sitting in the back seat, and be forced to communicate with them through the game’s interface. That added complexity — on top of learning to start-up and fly a Cold War-era jet — was a bridge too far for me.</p>
<p id="ENzaAx">Well, it turns out you can pass control of that second seat to another human player. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OperatorDrewski/videos">OperatorDrewski</a> shows how in a video published late last week. Together, he and a friend grapple with the unusual airplane and actually log a few kills... before starting a conga line of enemy MIGs that chases them all the way back to a friendly airbase for refueling.</p>

<p id="IlwOg1">Even if you’re not way into flight simulation, the video is action-packed and charming. The pair have great chemistry in the cockpit, and by the end it feels more like an outtake from an aborted <em>Iron Eagle</em>-style comedy then a let’s-play video.</p>
<p id="oKZT6p"><em>DCS World </em>is free to download, which you can do from Eagle Dynamics’ own website or on Steam. <em>DCS: F-4E Phantom II</em>, however, will set you back $79.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24170558/extreme-trials-unlock-mounts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="MLwmZC"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a><em> </em>has tons of fights in varying difficulties, including <strong>extreme trials</strong>, which are easier than savage raids, but harder than the story trials players will encounter.</p>
<p id="Cy55UF">Below, we explain everything you need to know about extreme trials in <em>FFXIV</em>, as well as where to unlock each extreme trial in each expansion.</p>

<hr id="3UhKav">
<h2 id="HXHw56"><strong>Extreme trials in FFXIV, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="5649tF">Extreme trials are harder versions of existing trials that reward high-level gear (at the time of its launch) and other rewards like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14/22382215/mount-unlock-chocobo-flying-level-requirement">mounts</a>, crafting materials, and orchestrions.</p>
<p id="Wz6VRL">At the time of their respective releases, extreme trials are difficult and require a party that’s willing to communicate positions and patterns to complete (unlike a normal trial, which you can just queue into and defeat). Rather than using the duty finder to find a group to clear extreme fights with, you’ll need to revert to using <strong>party finder</strong>.</p>
<p id="VDQK0h">Once a new expansion drops, you can <strong>unsync </strong>the trials from the previous expansion, so you can fight it without your gear being synced down to the level of the boss. For example, after <em>Shadowbringers</em> launched, you could then unsync Byakko, beating him down quickly with a higher level and better gear. This allows you to farm out a mount or gear without having to pay <em>too</em> much attention to the usually complex mechanics.</p>
<p id="dRXzbc">Clearing the extreme trial will reward one of the boss’ weapons as well as a chance to drop the other aforementioned loot. Each clear will also reward you with a <strong>totem </strong>for that boss (except for the extreme trials in<em> A Realm Reborn,</em> which do not utilize totems). Some lengthier fights will even reward two totems, like Hades or Barbariccia. You can trade totems to merchants to get specific weapons you may want at a 10:1 ratio or the mount at a 99:1 ratio, if you’ve been unlucky with your loot rolls.</p>
<p id="Vv4ptF">All extreme trials require you to complete the normal version of the trial first before you can unlock it, so if you haven’t unlocked all the trials yet (especially since some are optional), you should do that first.</p>
<hr id="iwZmd7">
<h2 id="C1FNYi"><strong>Where to unlock A Realm Reborn extreme trials</strong></h2>
<p id="zrSktR"><em>ARR</em>’s extreme trials are the only ones that have a somewhat convoluted method to unlock them. Most of the trials (<strong>Garuda</strong>, <strong>Titan</strong>, <strong>Ifrit</strong>, <strong>Good King Moggle Mog XII</strong>, <strong>Leviathan</strong>, <strong>Ramuh</strong>, and <strong>Shiva</strong>) are unlocked via talking to <strong>Urianger in the Waking Sands</strong> (in Western Thanalan):</p>

<p id="AsMOtB">He’ll give you a quest chain starting with “Primal Nature,” and as you complete each quest, you’ll move along in the story, unlocking the next quest to unlock the next extreme.</p>
<p id="QS0lmU">Unfortunately, you have to unlock them in order, as they are part of an actual quest chain. Luckily, these fights can be completed quickly with unsynced settings, if you’re at about level 70 and above (with appropriately leveled gear). If not, you can always make a party finder group and say it’s for a first clear — veteran players will come help you, as they get <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24125345/tomestones-poetics-what-to-spend-cap">Poetics</a> and <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Wondrous_Tails">Wondrous Tails</a> retries as a reward.</p>
<p id="wlefjJ">The extreme version of <strong>Ultimate Weapon</strong>, titled “The Minstrel’s Ballad: Ultima’s Bane,’’ is actually unlocked from a different NPC. Talk to <strong>Alys in Mor Dhona</strong> to start the quest “The Ultimate Ballad” and unlock it:</p>

<p id="6ZzxKh">The mounts dropped as a reward for <em>A Realm Reborn</em> extreme trials are based off of <strong>horses</strong>, with each trial giving a unique colored glowing horse. Garuda, Titan, and Ifrit also have a chance to drop a special black unicorn mount, called the <strong>Nightmare</strong>. Good King Moggle Mog XII doesn’t drop a mount whistle. Collecting all six horse mounts (not including Nightmare) allows you to unlock the <strong>Kirin </strong>mount through the quest “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/b1a689f6489">A Legend for a Legend</a>.”</p>

<p id="ogFC1g">Unlike the <em>ARR </em>quests, you can accept any of the <em>Heavensward</em> quests in any order, allowing you to unlock the extreme trials in whatever order you want. The quests and their respective unlock are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="gBPS1W">“The Diabolical Bismarck” — “The Limitless Blue (Extreme)” (<strong>Bismarck</strong>)</li>
<li id="4Eux6L">“Thok Around the Clock” — “Thok ast Thok (Extreme)” (<strong>Ravana</strong>)</li>
<li id="nzyMRl">“A Fiendish Likeness” — “Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)” (<strong>Sephirot</strong>)</li>
<li id="QRiJbi">“A Deific Simulacrum” — “Containment Bay P1T6 (Extreme)” (<strong>Sophia</strong>)</li>
<li id="w5kqUd">“A Demonic Duplicate” — “Containment Bay Z1T9 (Extreme)” (<strong>Zurvan</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p id="9A8Qcm">Two of the <em>Heavensward</em> extremes are locked behind quests given by Alys in Mor Dhona again:</p>
<ul>
<li id="g29dsU">“Thordan’s Reign” — “The Minstrel’s Ballad: Thordan’s Reign” (<strong>King Thordan</strong>)</li>
<li id="sRoCxg">“Nidhogg’s Rage” — “The Minstrel’s Ballad: Nidhogg’s Rage” (<strong>Nidhogg</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p id="QyRn0V">You can trade your <em>Heavensward </em>totems to <strong>Bertana in Idyllshire</strong> or the <strong>Rowena’s Representative in Ishgard</strong> for loot.</p>
<p id="s8g3F6">The mounts in <em>Heavensward</em> are colorful glowing birds called <strong>lanners</strong>. Getting all seven lanners will allow you to unlock the <strong>Firebird </strong>mount via the quest “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/ee552b1c76e/">Fiery Wings, Fiery Hearts</a>.”</p>

<p id="FuZC66">The extreme version of Rathalos does drop a <strong>Rathalos mount</strong> and rather than totems, it rewards “Rathalos Scale+.” You can trade in the Rathalos Scale+ for armor, a Poogie minion, a Monster Hunter orchestrion roll, or the Rathalos mount to the Smithy in Kugane (next to the Hearty Hunter). You’ll need 50 Rathalos Scale+ to get the mount.</p>

Instead of asking who and what Waffle House is, as he did at the end of March, Harada asked his X (formerly Twitter) followers why fights happen so often at Waffle House to warrant its unrelated fame as the unofficial American battleground.</p><p>"Why do fights like this between waitstaff and customers happen so often in the restaurant? I have never seen plates and chairs flying around like this, especially in Japan (and the composition is not customer vs. customer, but customer vs. waiter),” Harada wrote in a quote retweet of a Waffle House fight video. on X. “I don't think it is simply because it is ‘open 24 hours and there are many drunks.’ What kind of culture is this?"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Why do fights like this between waitstaff and customers happen so often in the restaurant?</p></div><p>Harada went on to voice his stream-of-consciousness thoughts on Waffle House as the unofficial American fighting battleground by admitting he wouldn’t be able to grasp its status in America even if he took 70 business trips to the States. </p><p>"I need to learn more about American society," Harada wrote. </p><p>For more Tekken 8 news, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review">our Tekken 8 review</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/tekken-8-official-lidia-sobieska-gameplay-trailer">new gameplay trailer for  Lidia Sobiesk</a>, its second DLC character due later this summer.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

This is for the Champion Edition as well, so you're getting Street Fighter V, 24 characters, and every piece of add-on content released for the game. In its complete state, it's a heck of a great fighting game and a significant entry in the series.</p><p>Speaking of animated characters throwing hands, <strong>River City Girls 2</strong> is a brilliant beat-'em-up adventure packed with new abilities, enemies, allies, locations, and more. It features the return of Misako, Kyoko, Kunio, and Riki--as well as new faces Marian and Provie--and its combat is deeper than ever. If you'd prefer something more thought-provoking, <strong>A Space for the Unbound</strong> is a fascinating slice-of-life adventure game with beautiful pixel art set in the late '90s of rural Indonesia. The game tells the story of overcoming anxiety, dealing with depression, and the relationship of a boy and a girl with supernatural powers.</p><p><strong>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</strong> is pure metroidvania magic crafted in the gothic dark fantasy style of Castlevania. It was produced by Koji Igarashi, a former development lead on the Castlevania series. If you're a Castlevania fan, Bloodstained is a spiritual successor that's worth your time. You can also pick up <strong>Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</strong>, a collection of six classic Capcom games from the GBA and DS era: Mega Man Zero 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as Mega Man ZX, and ZX Advent.</p><p>Other highlights include the baseball-inspired platformer <strong>Bat Boy</strong>, <strong>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</strong>, and <strong>Nexomon: Extinction</strong>, an RPG heavily inspired by Pokemon. And if you're in a metroidvania mood, you can pair Bloodstained with <strong>Afterimage</strong> and <strong>The Knight Witch</strong>, two solid metroidvanias that scratch a similar itch.</p><p>For more, you can see the full list below of what you can grab from this Fanatical bundle.</p><h2><span>Fanatical Build Your Own Bento Deluxe Box Sale</span></h2><ul><li>Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>ANNO: Mutationem (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>A Space for the Unbound (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>River City Girls 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Shantae and the Seven Sirens (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dream Tactics</li><li>Astria Ascending (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Bat Boy (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Affogato (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Rabi-Ribi (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Nexomon: Extinction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Street Fighter V: Champion Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Yangyang Mobile Double Pack</li><li>MAMIYA (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Puzzles For Clef (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Mahokenshi - The Samurai Deckbuilder (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Tiny Life (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers</li><li>Afterimage (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>The Knight Witch (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>RWBY: Arrowfell</li></ul><p><em>Disclaimer: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The exclusive <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-5-star-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-Star characters</a> are among <em>Wuthering Waves</em>‘ most sought-after Resonators<em>. </em>In particular, the botanist Verina can be an essential asset to your team, providing you have the right gear. In this guide, we’ll go over the best Verina builds in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, including weapons, Echoes, and team compositions.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-verina-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best weapons for Verina in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The <strong>4-Star Variation</strong> is the best weapon to use for Verina in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-guide-crystal-locations-and-puzzle-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. It perfectly complements her robust healing abilities and offers a decent amount of Energy Regeneration. The Ceaseless Aria also restores Concerto Energy once a Resonance Skill has been released.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"><strong>Cosmic Ripples</strong> is an excellent alternative if you’re looking for a 5-Star weapon. This Recitifier can help with Verina’s Energy Regeneration, but it is slightly less than the Variation weapon. That said, it may be best to stick with Variation, especially since it may be easier to get ahold of.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-verina-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Verina in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Given that Verina plays a support role, it’s essential to equip gear that caters to this category. The <strong>Bell-Borne Geochelone</strong> is the best main Echo option for her, as it dramatically reduces damage reduction. It also offers a 10 percent DMG boost to enhance your offense.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">In addition to the Bell-Borne Geochelone, the Sonata Effect, <strong>Rejuvenating Glow (5 pieces), </strong>aims to boost Verina’s performance even more<strong>. </strong>It provides an additional 10 percent healing boost, which will help keep your teammates alive for longer periods. Plus, the ability increases the ATK of all party members by 15 percent for 30 seconds upon healing.</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Stonewall Bracer and Moonlit Clouds</strong> are another fantastic alternative for Verina’s main Echo and Sonata sets. It’s great for beginner players who may not have unlocked the Bell-Borne Geochelone set yet.</p> <figure data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Use the Echo to turn into a Stonewall Bracer, offering a charge-forward attack. If the Moonlit Clouds are active, Energy Regeneration and ATK will increase. The more these stats are increased, the better your chances of healing the entire team.</p> <h2 id="h-best-team-comps-for-verina-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best team comps for Verina in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Verina works well with almost any Rovers due to her dynamic support role. For beginner players, you can pair her with <strong>Rover (Spectro) and Yangyang. </strong>Anytime these characters attack a target, her Resonance Liberation deals Spectro DMG and heals all team members gradually.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you’ve unlocked characters with higher DPS, consider pairing Verina with <strong>Calcharo and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan</a></strong>. While Resonators with the best attack stats are the most suitable for Verina, she’s versatile enough to work with any fighter, giving you the freedom to experiment with different team compositions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inworld-and-nvidia-demonstrate-on-device-ai-character-behavior/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Computex 2024, Inworld AI and NVIDIA have presented an updated version of the Covert Protocol demo (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-presents-covert-protocol-demo-powered-by-inworld-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously seen at GDC 2024</a>) that runs partially on local devices rather than via cloud.</p>
<p>It is a necessary development that I had already discussed with Inworld AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-inworld-ai-qa-everyone-in-gaming-sees-the-potential-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my recent interview with Product Manager Nathan Yu</a>. Keeping everything working via the cloud would maintain costs too high to be viable in most cases. In the exclusive Wccftech Q&amp;A, Yu said:</p>
<p><em>Absolutely. Yes. we'll definitely get there. We saw a lot of exciting announcements even at GTC for dedicated hardware in the future for AI versus rendering today.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a lot of questions, like, if we do move to on devices, will that impact graphics rendering? That becomes a nonstarter conversation for a lot of studios. But at Inworld we do support hybrid as well. Some services could run locally, some services run on cloud inferencing, and that can short-term optimize costs and latency. But in the future, I think we can all agree that it's going to get there. It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time. I'm excited to see that as well.</em></p>
<p>This crucial step forward came even sooner than I thought. Today, Inworld's Nathan Yu <a href="https://www.inworld.ai/blog/nvidia-inworld-ai-demo-on-device-capabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on the official blog:</p>
<p><em>At Inworld, we recognize that implementing sophisticated AI in games poses not only technical but also economic challenges. Traditionally, offloading AI processing to remote servers can be costly and may introduce latency that disrupts the player experience. While the Inworld Engine is optimized for real-time and cost efficiency, we also recognize the importance of giving developers control and flexibility over their games' performance and user experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Covert Protocol is just one example of how developers can take advantage of hybrid deployments to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their games. As more powerful multimodal and language models become smaller and more efficient, the future of on-device AI for developers feels not just promising, but inevitable.</em></p>
<p><em>In a world where AI agents go beyond dialogue and NPCs to shape procedural content, manage complex physics simulations, and adaptively adjust gameplay, on-device deployments become even more critical.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA &amp; Inworld AI demo on-device capabilities for AI agents in video games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6UF6j9LwZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Specifically, Inworld worked with NVIDIA to switch the Audio2Face facial animation system and Riva ASR (automatic speech recognition) to local devices. When it comes to Inworld's technology, the NPC's Emotion parameters can be synced to client-side animations. However, voices are still synthesized at runtime via the Inworld cloud.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that voices are not required for Inworld's NPC AI engine. As discussed in the aforementioned interview, it is only an optional feature that game developers may or may not enable, depending on their design and immersion goals.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/game-reward-ending-shut-down/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-reward-ending-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>GAME, the United Kingdom’s biggest video game retailer, continues down a dark path of no return as news surfaces that the firm is <strong>ending </strong>its ‘GAME Reward’ scheme that has been running for more than two decades. It’s also bringing to a close the GAME Elite membership that was kicked off in 2017, offering consumers additional benefits in exchange for a £36-a-year subscription fee.</p>



<p>In a press release and email circulation, GAME advised customers that it will be shutting down GAME Reward and GAME Elite as of July 31, 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falling-further">Falling Further</h2>



<p>Recently, news surfaced that GAME was preparing to make layoffs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-redundancies-contracts/">was putting staff on zero-hour contracts</a>. Before that, the firm confirmed it was stopping the sale and purchase of pre-owned tech and software, marking the end of an era for the iconic high street staple. </p>



<p>In this latest twist, the retailer has <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/reward/">revealed plans to shut down GAME Reward</a>, which over the last two decades or so saw customers earning points on their purchases that they could then spend on future purchases online or in-store. With a GAME Reward card, consumers could also make pre-orders and get special in-store offers on an exclusive basis.</p>



<p>On July 15, customers will <strong>stop </strong>earning points on their purchases, and everyone has until July 31 to redeem any outstanding points. The problem is that most GAME stores (which are now concessions inside Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores) can’t process a transaction using a GAME Reward card as a payment option. The best course of action is to spend any outstanding credit on the website.</p>



<p>Closing GAME Elite means that monthly prize draws, exclusive promotions, and boosted points-based rewards will also be shut down as of July 31. That marks the end of one of the sole reasons to still shop in a GAME store.</p>



<p>Many anticipate that within a year or so, GAME will be confined solely to an online storefront, and that’s a sad thing for UK-based gamers – especially those prone to nostalgia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-released-by-games-workshop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, Games Workshop announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Fourth Edition</em></a>. Naturally, the arrival of an update to a beloved tabletop miniatures game includes changes. To help bring new players up to speed, GW has even made a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> How To Play video.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/21/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-faction-focus-stormcast-eternals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop highlights what the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video covers. As expected, the video covers every aspect of an Age of Sigmar match. What you need to play. How to build your army. The structure of a Battle Round and the phases of combat. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-miniature-screenshots.jpg?itok=xmM4QWQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-how-to-play-video-miniature-screenshots.jpg?itok=vq9mzfKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Need to know the difference between ranged phase and charging phase? Watch this.</figcaption></figure><p>The video also highlights the changes being introduced in <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> <em>Fourth Edition</em>. This includes the more flexible <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-preview-introduces-modularity">modularity</a> of assembling an army as well as various changes to melee combat, spellcasting, and prayers.</p>

<p>As for the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video itself, it covers a lot of ground. GW's own Lewis' narration is supplemented by clear visuals illustrating rules, abilities, and the logistics of dice rolls.</p>

<p>The video even acts as an extended preview. It shows off several new models and units for the Skaven and Stormcast Eternals armies, providing established fans a glimpse what is in store.</p>

<p>At eight minutes and thirty seconds, the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> How To Play video only covers the basics of play. It does not go into further detail on more unique abilities held by certain armies. Neither does it stray into specific edge cases. In that regard, the video ends encouraging players to read the core rulebook to learn more.</p>

<p>Emphasizing this glimpse into further complexity, the post links to ten different articles focusing on other armies in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>.</p>

<p>It showcases notable tactics and units for the Stormcast Eternals, Skaven, Gloomspite Gitz, Nighthaunt, Cities of Sigmar, Kharadon Overlords, Disicples of Tzeentch, Ogor Mawtribes, Flesh-Eater Courts, and the Fyreslayers. An eleventh article on the Idoneth Deepkin is set to release soon.</p>

Plus, some of the most useful stuff to snag from foes are items, which means you can’t use them in Hard mode (<em>Rebirth</em>’s end-game difficulty that locks you out of using things like potions, ethers, offensive items like grenades, and more).</p><h3 id="h98692"><a id=""></a>Celeris is one of the most abundantly stealable items (and it’s very useful)</h3><p>Celeris lets you cast Haste on a target. This speeds up your attack speed. While you can cast this as a spell with Time materia, using an item doesn’t drain MP. You can steal Celeris from the following enemies (the Fiend Intel enemies are the most farmable):</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Aggrevrikon</strong>: Fiend Intel 5 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Bandit</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 3 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Beck</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Burke</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Butch</strong>: Fought during Phenomenon Intel 4 in Grasslands</p><p><strong>Levridon</strong>: Fought during the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-best-sidequests-1851320689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ff7-best-sidequests-1851320689">O Chicken, Where Art Thou” side-quest</a></span></p><p><strong>Levrikon</strong>: Found roaming in the Grasslands</p></blockquote><h3 id="h98693"><a id=""></a>You can steal crafting components from enemies</h3><p>There are a few items worth using this materia for.

You can steal these from Devil Riders, which appear during the “Hustle and Grind” side-quest. Mega-potions aren’t as good (they only restore 1,500 HP), but they’re still good to have.

                <p dir="ltr">In celebration of Minecraft's 15th anniversary, Lego is releasing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRX64YFN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new diorama kit based on the Minecraft Crafting Table</a> that players are sure to recognize. The kit is packed with references from the game, including customizable landscape scenes and a collection of new microfigures based on Minecraft characters, NPCs, and enemies. The set launches later this year, but preorders are already available online.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lego Minecraft Crafting Table is a 1,195-piece kit that, naturally, resembles the in-game crafting table, but with two open sides and a removable top that reveals an interior landscape diorama. The inner diorama includes 12 mini scenes based on the game's many biomes, including overworld zones like the Plains, Forest, and Cherry Grove, and underground sections like Dripstone Cave, Deep Dark, and more. The model assembles into a cube that stands 5.5 inches tall, six inches wide, and six inches deep.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4312152-minecraftdioramahero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312152" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4312152-minecraftdioramahero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4312152"></a><figcaption>Lego Minecraft Crafting Table</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4312152-minecraftdioramahero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To fit with the set's compact size, the Lego Minecraft Crafting Table comes with eight "microfigures," which are even tinier versions of the iconic Lego minifigures. The eight microfigures for this set include the Minecraft mascots Steve and Alex, in-game monsters like the Creeper, skeleton, and witch, and friendly NPCs the villager, cow, and pig. There is also a selection of swappable display bricks featuring famous phrases from the game, like "Create New World," "You Are The Player 1," and the Minecraft logo that you can place on designated panels on the outside of the diorama. The official description also promises Easter Eggs and references hidden throughout the set, so this sounds like it'll be a fun build for long-time fans of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lego Minecraft Crafting Table set launches on August 1 for $90.

<p data-characters="374" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed killer Vecna, The Lich, has officially come to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Despite early reports that Vecna was a rather weak killer compared to others, players have discovered some specific builds that can really take advantage of the four spells Vecna has it his disposal. Here is the best Vecna, The Lich build in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> as of patch 8.0.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-vecna-the-lich-builds" data-injectable="false">Best Vecna, The Lich builds</h2> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">In the early part of the Public Test Server for Vecna, The Lich, players felt as though the new D&amp;D killer was a bit on the weaker side. However, after players got more time to learn him and discover his strengths and weaknesses, alongside a launch day buff specifically for Vecna, he’s shaping up to be one of the stronger killers in the game when paired with the right build. Here are all of the best Vecna, The Lich builds in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>:</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-handy-lich-build" data-injectable="false">The Handy Lich Build</h3> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons: </strong>Potion of Speed and Ring of Telekinesis</p> <p data-characters="7" data-current-count="55" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks: </strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false"> <li>Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance</li> <li>Scourge Hook: Floods of Rage</li> <li>Make Your Choice</li> <li>Friends ‘Til The End</li> </ul> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true"><strong>About this Build:</strong> One of the hardest killer counters in the meta of <em>Dead by Daylight</em> is the crafty use of pallet dropping. Vecna has the perfect kit to counter this with his Mage Hand spell that allows him to punish Survivors for making the decision to drop pallets. With this build, you’re able to quickly catch up to survivors thanks to the Potion of Speed and punish Survivors for dropping a pallet via the increased pallet lift speed of Mage Hand thanks to Ring of Telekinesis.</p>
 <h3 id="h-vecna-master-of-bleeds-build" data-injectable="false">Vecna, Master of Bleeds Build</h3> <p data-characters="44" data-current-count="44" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons:</strong> Vorpal Sword and Dragontooth Dagger</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="50" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sloppy Butcher</li> <li>Scourge Hook: Gift of Pain</li> <li>Blood Echo</li> <li>Forced Penance</li> </ul> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><strong>About this Build:</strong> The Vecna Master of Bleeds build for The Lich focuses on utilizing the new Dragontooth Dagger Add-On to apply Hemmorhage and Mangled on Survivors hit with a basic attack while holding a Magic Item. While higher-level players can counter this build by not picking up Magic Items, the items themselves are often too strong to be passed up on and is really an easy way to typically enhance your chances against Vecna. </p>
 <h3 id="h-speedlich-build" data-injectable="false">SpeedLich Build</h3> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="49" data-injectable="false"><strong>Add-Ons:</strong> Boots of Speed and Ring of Spell Storing</p> <p data-characters="6" data-current-count="55" data-injectable="false"><strong>Perks:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false"> <li>Corrupt Intervention</li> <li>Bamboozle</li> <li>Deadlock</li> <li>Pop Goes the Weasel</li> </ul> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="false"><strong>About this Build:</strong> The SpeedLich build for Vecna focuses on the synergy between the two Add-Ons, Boots of Speed and Ring of Spell Storing. Boots of Speed increases the speed of Vecna by 5% for 2 seconds after casting Mage Hand, while Ring of Spell Storing reduces the cooldown on all your spells, including Mage Hand, by 4 seconds. This allows Vecna to essentially become a speed demon by using Mage Hand as much as possible to quickly traverse the map.</p>

These free cars are included in the game at no cost to players, or can be unlocked for free without spending any money. The relevant detail is that these free cars tend to feature large windshields, making it much easier to shoot the driver inside the car. </p><p>Meanwhile, most premium cars—some of them based on real-life vehicles—have smaller windshields. As a result, it’s much, much harder to shoot players in these cars. </p><p>This has set off a firestorm online as players feel like this directly contradicts Epic’s claim that cosmetics offered in <em>Fortnite’s </em>item shop don’t provide any kind of advantage during gameplay. I’ll also add that in my experience playing the new season, I have a harder time hitting drivers using “paid cars.” </p><p><strong>Updated: 06/4/2024, 5:35 p.m. ET: </strong>Epic sent this short comment over to <em>Kotaku </em>about the situation:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re aware of the issue and have a fix planned for an upcoming build.</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, this isn’t the first time car skins have been accused of offering players an advantage. When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/race-without-limits-in-rocket-racing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/race-without-limits-in-rocket-racing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosmetic car skins were added to <em>Fortnite </em>in 2023</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/18e8zsh/vehicle_cosmetics_change_the_hitbox_of_cars&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/18e8zsh/vehicle_cosmetics_change_the_hitbox_of_cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players documented</a></span> that some skins had different hitboxes, which could offer a slight advantage in certain situations. </p><p>However, this latest discovery involving windshields seems much worse, and in a season so heavily focused on car combat, it seems like a bad design choice that will punish players unable or unwilling to spend money on pricey in-game cars.</p><p>&nbsp; .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
