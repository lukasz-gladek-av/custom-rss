In the past 14 years, Perry has been having trouble finding relevance in a pop space where she was once dominant, and that could not be more clear after today, July 12, as she released her new single “Woman’s World.” The “anthemic” pop song is getting raked across the coals online. It has me thinking back on one of her career highlights of the past decade: the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-teams-with-pokemon-for-some-sort-of-25th-ann-1846050105&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-teams-with-pokemon-for-some-sort-of-25th-ann-1846050105"><em>Pokémon</em> 25th anniversary single and music video “Electric.”</a></span> “Woman’s World” is so bad I can’t help but feel like she’s embarrassing her friend Pikachu, and wonder where was the little electric rat to stop her friend from putting out this monstrosity.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>To catch up with those who aren’t tuned into pop music, Perry’s new single “Woman’s World” was under fire long before it was released today. When she released a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@katyperry/video/7381503148105501994?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katyperry/video/7381503148105501994?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip of the song on June 17</a></span>, its lyrics were roasted for sounding like the kind of thing you sing to your dog when no one is home. It’s meant to be empowering, and it mostly just ends up being Perry saying a bunch of adjectives and platitudes. It’s a toothless, juvenile song that only got worse as the truth of its creation was revealed. When it came out that Dr. Luke, the same man who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.as.com/entertainment/katy-perry-to-release-new-song-womans-world-lyrics-and-comments-about-dr-luke-collaboration-n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of assaulting women like fellow pop star Kesha</a></span> and being misogynistic and predatory toward women in the industry, was a writer and producer for the song, the entire pro-woman anthem became a laughing stock of the internet. There are six writers on “Woman’s World” and four of them are men.</p><p>The music video that also launched today is pretty nonsensical. “Woman’s World” is the kind of shit you’ll hear on women’s razor commercials, but when it’s not cashing in on the most cliched and generic feminist imagery, it’s leaning into a strange, absurdism like Perry filling her ass with unleaded gas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.themarysue.com/who-is-trisha-paytas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Controversial YouTuber Trisha Paytas</a></span> is here, for some reason and drives Perry around in a monster truck, then the singer is airlifted out of a random girl’s backyard by a helicopter as the onlooker just screams “who are you” at her. Apt.</p><p>Perry told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a61572041/katy-perry-womans-world-lyrics-meaning/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a61572041/katy-perry-womans-world-lyrics-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elle</em></a></span><em> </em>that she knows a lot of people associate her music with empowering messages. In fairness, that’s true, if you look at songs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Firework”</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Roar,”</a></span> but those songs were far more effective thanks to their specificity. “Firework” was a queer anthem in the 2010s because it spoke specifically to finding the light inside oneself despite hardship. “Roar” works when it’s speaking to how power dynamics in relationships can make us small and about reclaiming your space. “Woman’s World” essentially boils down to “women exist,” while also propping up one of the most prominent known abusers in the music industry.</p><p>But “Electric,” the 2021 <em>Pokémon</em> anthemic pop song, was all of those things.</p><p>I’m a total mark because while some might call the song cheesy, I get a little choked up listening to it and watching the music video with Perry and her partner Pikachu. The two time travel to an earlier point in their lives when Perry was younger and trying to make it in music, though her Pikachu was a Pichu at the time. The duo helps their younger selves get past a rut in their respective careers. It’s all very sweet, actually. It would’ve been great for a future version of her and Pikachu to have stopped the sequence of events that had her collaborating with a known abuser and putting out the most half-hearted swing at a feminist anthem as she attempts a comeback.<br></p><p>We reached out to Perry’s Pikachu for comment and she said, “Pika, piiiiiiikaaaa” with a bewildered expression.</p><p>But that disappointment is how I feel listening to most of Perry’s music. <em>Teenage Dream </em>is legitimately one of the most important pop records of the modern era and the falloff has been disastrous to watch unfold. Her next album, <em>143</em>, launches on September 20. Hopefully, there is something to redeem it after this shitshow.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is expected to be launching its GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card this year, and rumors are starting to circulate about just how powerful these GPUs will be. And the latest involves the base clock speed of the flagship 5000 series GPU.</p>



<p>According to a known leaker on the Chiphell forums (h/t to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/rumor-geforce-rtx-5090-base-clock-nears-2-9-ghz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>), the RTX 5090 will have a base clock of nearly 2.9 GHz. That’s a 30% increase from the 2.23 GHz of the RTX 4090. It even beats out the RTX 4090’s boost speed of 2.52 GHz.</p>



<p>There was no mention of a potential boost clock for the GPU. </p>



<p>In addition to the base clock claims, the RTX 5090 is rumored to feature a 448-bit memory bus with a bandwidth of 1568 GB/s and 28GB of GDDR7 memory. </p>

<p>Nvidia has yet to confirm any of these rumors regarding the RTX 5090, and refuse to comment on any “rumor or speculation”. The RTX 5000 series is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2024/04/09/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-expected-to-launch-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly on tap</a> to start launching in late 2024.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99re-all-lucky-joe-biden-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-to-say-video-game-titles.926172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-titles-same<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I missed Joe Biden’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-news-conference-reelection-age-0d9f4936484ff71295e2b088e5c525dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press conference</a> last night because I was doing the much more enjoyable activity of riding my bike, but apparently he mixed up several names, calling Vice President Kamala Harris “Vice President Trump” (erg) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “President Putin” (<em>erg</em>). None of these are particularly out of character for him, which you might either see as an increasingly bad sign, or as a sign of business as usual, which might also be bad. People have been using this as an excuse to make video games jokes, which are very funny. But more importantly, they pave the way for me to write a blog I’ve been meaning to write for years, about video games that have the same name.</p><p>First, the memes: “JUST IN: Biden reportedly confused THE OUTER WORLDS for THE OUTER WILDS!!” wrote <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1811583174637437120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter user Radec</a>, in a widely-reposted tweet. Other good jokes include Biden imaginarily mixing up “<a href="https://x.com/TheofficialJugg/status/1811755355816227035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> and <em>Fire Emblem: Three Heroes</em></a>,” “<a href="https://x.com/airbagged/status/1811747633217593489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Grow Home</em></a>,” and “<a href="https://x.com/siegmeyer161/status/1811702494097031528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> and <em>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</em></a>.”</p><p>Now, let’s undertake the more important task of making this historical moment about me. Ever since <em>Outer Worlds</em> came out a few months after <em>Outer Wilds</em>, part of my job as an editor at Kotaku became find-replacing the words “wilds” or “worlds” in everyone’s blogs about one or the other game. The games couldn’t be more different, but it’s impossible not to mix these two titles up. I was even amused to see that Google suggests “people also search for <em>The Outer Worlds</em>” when I Googled <em>Outer Wilds</em>. (I literally mixed them up writing that last sentence!)</p><p>After <em>Outer Worlds</em>, I started keeping a list of other video games that have the same title. That list is sadly lost to failing to save it from my Kotaku docs when I left, but here’s what I can recreate of it from memory, as well as some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/16fve4m/what_video_game_titles_do_you_always_confuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggestions</a> from Reddit:</p><ul><li><span><em>Warframe</em> and <em>Warface</em></span></li><li><span><em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Battlefront</em></span></li><li><span><em>Gloomhaven</em> and <em>Gloomwood</em></span></li><li><span><em>Deadlight</em>, <em>Dead by Daylight,</em> and <em>Dying Light</em></span></li><li><span><em>God of War</em> and <em>Gears of War</em></span></li><li><span>The fact that there are two <em>Star Wars Battlefronts</em> and once when writing a blog mentioning them I used a picture of the wrong one and the commenters tore me to shreds</span></li><li><span>“AC” being either <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> or <em>Animal Crossing</em> (or <em>Armored Core</em>)</span></li><li><span>“DS” being either <em>Death Stranding</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>, or <em>Dark Souls</em></span></li></ul><p>This is all to say nothing of the games that you mix up based on looks, plot, or vibes. I can’t draw any grand conclusion about video games (or politics) from this; lots of games are about the same thing, and there are only so many words you can put into a title, though lord knows video games love to make you say nonsense words out loud when you’re looking for them at the store.&nbsp;</p><p>I tend to find Biden’s verbal stumbles largely harmless, especially for someone who struggles with stuttering, but I’m with my pals at <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/the-president-does-not-deserve-our" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discourse Blog</a> that we are not under any obligation to cut him some slack here–while everybody ages, everybody is not the President. I have been putting off calling my ride-or-die Democrat mom ever since the debate, but this is a good reminder that I should do that. Please put your favorite video game title mixups in the comments so I’ll have something to laugh about after she and I get into a fight.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Though Yars Rising pays tribute to its Atari roots with arcade-style hacking games, puzzles, action-packed gameplay, and anime-style character art help the game establish a new, modern identity.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Okay, I'll admit it: Outside of my brief love affair with Galaga and the small bit of Frogger I played as a child, I've never meaningfully engaged with the vast majority of arcade games. It's my weakest area in terms of video game genres I'm knowledgeable in and as such, I walked into my appointment to play Yars Rising only minimally aware of its first entry and the impact it had at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon its release in 1982, Yars' Revenge--the first entry in the Yars series--became the highest-grossing original title for the Atari 2600. It's been included in more than a few Atari classics collections, a handful "Greatest Games of All-Time'' lists, and a display on video game history at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Though part of its popularity was due to Atari's status as a video game powerhouse at the time--thus giving the studio the necessary resources to actually promote Yars' Revenge and build "hype,'' as we'd call it here in the year 2024--it was also just an incredibly solid sci-fi shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, despite its success, a follow-up to Yars' Revenge (a rail-shooter called Yar's Revenge) didn't emerge for nearly three decades and was largely met with disdain--<a href="https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____153#google_vignette" rel="nofollow ">even from series creator Howard Scott Warshaw</a>. But after <em>another</em> decade--and another stab at regniting the Yars fandom with Yars: Recharged--Atari has recruited a new studio, Shantae and River City Girls developer WayForward, to help revitalize the series. The first challenge for WayForward? Steering Yars away from flies and aliens and into a new, flashier direction. And based on my time spent with the upcoming reiteration, I feel confident that it's going to nail it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732"></a><figcaption>Emi takes on a robot lurking at QoTech.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rather than stick to Yars' arcade-shooter roots, Yars' Rising reimagines the game as a cyberpunk metroidvania. However, the game still honors its past by incorporating arcade games throughout the game via terminals that protagonist Emi "Yar" Kimura must hack in order to enhance her abilities and gain new powers. This creates the main gameplay loop as well as that metroidvania feel, as new powers mean access to new locations that were previously just out of reach.</p><p dir="ltr">It becomes very easy to feel like Samus Aran herself as you traverse the futuristic QoTech laboratory--crouching, wall-jumping, and blasting your way through obstacles and enemies--although I'd say, from what I saw, Yars lacks the same tension, complex puzzles, and hyper-satisfying sense of progression and traversal as many other titles in the genre, for better or worse. In many ways, it feels like a great starting point for people who are newer to the genre: You have fast-paced arcade minigames that require decent reflexes and add challenge (particularly for those of us who grew up after their time), some light 2D platforming and combat, and that sense of accomplishment of unlocking a new power and knowing precisely what to do with it. But where Yars Rising truly shines is in its overall aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">It comes as little surprise that WayForward knows how to make a game feel stylish and lively, and this is what chiefly sets the game apart from other 2D action-adventure games. Yars Rising kicks off with a comic-style opening--an homage to the Yars comic series that was released shortly after the original game--in which our Ramona Flowers-esque protagonist, Emi, frantically dresses and leaves her house to work at a job she hates. It's easy to adore Emi immediately, with her spunky attitude and outfit to match, but she's not the only lovable character in Yars Rising.</p><p dir="ltr">During the 40 or so minutes I played, I met several cute, anime-inspired characters that I am positive others will thirst for; I myself was not immune to Mrs. Davidson's good looks, pink hair, and arrogant attitude. Nearly all the game's characters boast colorful hair, stylish techwear, and bold personalities, and alongside the game's neon-lit levels and bouncy techno-pop music, this creates an overall peppy and energetic-feeling to the game. Considering your main goal is to take down a corrupt and oppressive company, it feels like a fun and very conscious choice to keep things a bit more light-hearted and anime-esque. So while the gameplay might be familiar, there was enough style and playful banter to give Yars Rising its own sense of identity and keep me engaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731"></a><figcaption>The world of Yars Rising</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yars Rising also implements a fun system that Nier Automata fans will automatically recognize and was a very intentional pull from the sci-fi action game, according to the developers I spoke with. Emi is able to Biohack herself and equip upgrades by inserting Tetris-like blocks--each one representing a different ability--into a slotted grid. Powers and upgrades will vary in size and shape, with more simplistic powers taking up one block of space whereas more complex powers are made up of multiple blocks in a more difficult-to-place shape. Something else I really enjoyed was how even small features--such as the ability to listen to music--were dependent upon equipping the right upgrade (in this case, Emi's Earbuds).</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I had a great time playing Yars Rising. While I didn't get the sense that it was anything particularly novel or challenging, it was a fun experience that left me wanting to see even more of Emi's world and the cute characters who inhabit it. Yars Rising is slated to come to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on September 10, 2024.</p>

            <p>
80s movie favourite The Karate Kid is being turned into a 16-bit-style side-scrolling beat-'em-up, and it's heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 20th September this year.
</p>
<p>
The Karate Kid: Street Rumble comes from GameMill Entertainment, the publisher behind Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and is firmly setting its sights on the 80s era of Karate Kid rather than Netflix's Cobra Kai continuation - which has already spawned two games itself.
</p>
<p>
Street Rumble is, somewhat surprisingly, only the second game to be directly based on the 80s movie series (the first, Atlus' NES action game The Karate Kid, arrived in 1987) and promises to feature a whole bunch of familiar faces as its 80s-set mulitplayer action unfolds.

<p>
As per Street Rumble's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-karate-kid-street-rumble-a-pixel-art-beat-em-up-announced-for-pc-and-consoles">IGN reveal</a>, Daniel Russo, Mr. Miyagi, Kumiko, and Ali Mills are all playable across the game's 12 belt-scrolling-style stages, for instance, while the likes of Johnny Lawrence, John Kreese, and Terry Silver will feature as foes.
</p>
<p>
There's not a lot else to report at present, but The Karate Kid: Street Rumble is scheduled to release for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 20th September - and you'll find some gamplay footage in the reveal trailer above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-team-reconsiders-seasons-2-0s-seasonal-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Division 2 team recently uploaded a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1811751120508764170/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update to X</a> in which they discuss their plans for Seasons 2.0 and the addition of Seasonal Characters. This comes after the broad feedback they received from the gaming community.</p>
<p>This comes after they received heavy backlash after announcing that they planned for everyone's character to reset to level 1 with each new season. Ubisoft commented that this was so that it felt like there was still a challenge to the game and that they wouldn't be able to steamroll through new content.</p>
<p>However, the community did not enjoy this prospect. As a result, Ubisoft Massive has reverted its original plan, opting to go forward <em>without</em> seasonal characters, a massive change for The Division 2 community. The developers have assured fans that "this change will not affect Year 6 plans, but it will require us to assess the changes necessary to the new Seasonal Experience."</p>
<p>While unsure what changes they will make to make Seasons 2.0 successful, they promise to return with news once they have ironed out the details. Once they have the information, a live stream and public test server (PTS) will be available for players to check out to get thorough research and feedback on their changes.</p>
<p>The response to the X post has been positive. The audience is mainly happy that they have decided to remove the changes they planned to implement. Currently, there are no concrete details as to what changes Ubisoft has made, but it sounds like players can keep their characters between seasons and can steamroll through the content if that is what they desire.</p>
<p>For the vast majority, the players are happy with the fact that they have reversed this decision. However, some players remain on tenterhooks while waiting for information from Ubisoft regarding what changes will be coming next. Will they be able to have fresh characters for each season and their main character, or will they be locked strictly into using their main character for the season?</p>
<p>At the moment, the community has many unanswered questions regarding the changes for Seasons 2.0 and seasonal characters. However, six years on, The Division 2 is still going strong and has a solid community, and even drastic changes cannot deter them from continuing to play the game and invest hours into it. The journey for Ubisoft hasn't been easy in creating content for this game, and trying to keep a live service game fun and fresh for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/">six years</a> is impressive. We eagerly await what changes Ubisoft will bring for the next season.</p>

One big complaint is that shaders or paints for cosmetics must be bought over and over for each new skin and character.

However, the particular details for the Olympic Esports Games, such as its city, date, qualifications for prospective players, and game titles, have yet to be hashed out.</p><p>“As a ‘first’ ever Esports Olympic Games, obviously there is still much to consider and plan with the IOC, but we are committed to hosting a special event that respects and celebrates the Olympic values while boldly seizing the momentum to drive esports forward with the international platform the sport and its athletes deserve,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, president of the Saudi Arabian Olympic and Paralympic Committee said. “The world will have an open invitation to join us in 2025 and celebrate this moment together.“</p><p>“We are very fortunate to be able to work with the Saudi NOC on the Olympic Esports Games, because it has great – if not unique – expertise in the field of esports with all its stakeholders. The Olympic Esports Games will greatly benefit from this experience,” IOC President Thomas Bach wrote. “By partnering with the Saudi NOC we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/gssnmb-waaarlng-1720805563099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Inagural Olympic Esports Games will take place in Saudi Arabia in 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In its announcement, the IOC also revealed plans for the International Federation and the National Olympic Committees’ “e-version” of sports to include in the Olympic Esports Games.

<!-- cache hit 36:single/related:70f9439d1b877eaae195c050e3aace95 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Analogue has released multiple variations of the Analogue Pocket, its Game Boy-style handheld console that can play old cartridges and game ROMs using its FPGA chip. But until now, all of those designs have been riffs on the regular Pocket’s black (or white) plastic shell.</p>
<p>The company’s latest Pocket iteration might appeal more to people who prefer the solidity and durability of anodized aluminum to the cheap practicality of plastic. <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1811777618447888740">On July 15</a>, the company will release <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">a limited run of all-aluminum Analogue Pocket consoles</a> in four different colors: white, gray, black, and a Game Boy Advance-esque indigo. The company says that "every single piece" of these consoles is "entirely CNC'd from aluminum," including not just the frame but also all of the buttons.</p>
<p>The new material will cost you, though: Each aluminum Pocket sells for $500, over twice as much as the $220 price of a regular plastic Pocket.</p>
<p>The aluminum versions of the Pocket will run the exact same software as the standard plastic ones and will be compatible with all the same cartridges and accessories. Analogue's site doesn't compare the weight of the aluminum and plastic Pocket consoles, though intuitively we'd expect the metal one to be heavier. The aluminum consoles begin shipping on July 17.</p>

<p>When the Pocket first launched in late 2021, ongoing supply chain disruptions and high demand led to monthslong wait times for the initial models. Things have gotten slightly better since then—you can't simply open Analogue's store on any given day and just buy one, but the basic black and white plastic models restock with some regularity. Analogue has also released multiple special edition runs of the handheld, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/analogues-supercharged-modern-day-game-boy-now-glows-in-the-dark/">one made of glow-in-the-dark plastic</a> and <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1725544375134921084">a colorful series of models</a> that recall <a href="https://gameboy.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Play_it_Loud_campaign">Nintendo's mid-'90s "Play It Loud!" hardware refresh</a> for the original Game Boy.</p>
<p>As much as we liked the Pocket in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">our original review</a>, the hardware has gotten much more capable thanks to a series of post-launch firmware updates. In the summer of 2022, Analogue added OpenFPGA support to the pocket, allowing its FPGA chip to emulate consoles like the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and others aside from the portable systems that the Pocket was designed to emulate. Updates toward the end of 2023 allowed those third-party emulation cores to use their own display filters, replicating the look of classic CRT TVs and other displays.</p>
<p>The updates have also fixed multiple bugs in the system. The latest update is version 2.2, released back in March, which primarily adds support for the Analogue Pocket Adapter Set that allows other kinds of vintage game cartridges to plug in to the Pocket's cartridge slot.</p>

			<p>NEXON's The First Descendant launched last week on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The free-to-play looter shooter game immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> Steam's Top 10 live chart (despite mixed reviews from users on Steam), and it looks like it has continued to perform well. Today, the official Twitter/X account of The First Descendant <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1811716560031215773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> reaching 10 million players across all platforms in the first week.</p>
<p>We don't have split numbers, of course. However, SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a concurrent player peak of 264K five days ago. Estimates of 'owners' on Valve's Steam range from 1.37 million players (<a href="https://vginsights.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to VG Insights</a>) to 3.19 million (<a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Gamalytic</a>).</p>
<p>NEXON's game also caused some controversy when it was found (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Forbes</a>) to have employed several skill icons that resembled those used by Bungie in Destiny 2. The development team has now shared a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN</a> addressing those allegations:</p>
<p><em>The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre. Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.</em></p>
<p>Regardless of the inspiration for the icons, there's no doubt that The First Descendant drew a lot from what is still the king of looter shooter games despite Bungie's many ups and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downs</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the developers deployed a hotfix (version 1.0.2) yesterday, adding the 'Start Public Operation' function (matchmaking) to Infiltration Operations (Hard). There's also a brief Director's comment on the changes:</p>
<p><em>The Dev Team acknowledges the community's concern about the monotonous patterns of Named Monsters and strives to enhance them. In particular, we've noted that the pattern involving breaking spheres in a specific order isn't appropriate for public matching and have decided to remove it immediately.</em><br>
<em>As new patterns are developed, we will soon update the patterns of existing Named Monsters one by one. As Named Monsters frequently appear in Hard difficulty and Special Operations, we will continue working towards diversifying their patterns.</em></p>
<p>On the optimization front, the developers at NEXON improved the stability of the shader preparation process by reducing the CPU load during shader generation. They also reduced GPU memory usage when set to&nbsp;High or higher quality.</p>
<p>Today, NEXON also announced the permanent ban of 3481 users from The First Descendant, with a publicly available list <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2601613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. These users either created, distributed, or used unauthorized software (e.g., cheats and hacks).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-is-the-latest-dev-to-issue-a-return-to-office-order.926064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been reported by a Polish news outlet that Techland has issued a ‘return to office’ order ‘suddenly and without consultation’, requesting that remote working staff change their operating model and head back into bricks-and-mortar offices. The report claims that anonymous sources close to the company voiced their fair share of concerns about the move, citing inadequate office facilities, amongst other things.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-old-school">Going Old School</h2>



<p>COVID-19 forced a work-from-home revolution that saw hundreds of millions of people worldwide start logging into their workplaces from their living rooms and home offices. It was a prominent move for developers, with some games being built by fully remote teams – which at the time was an amazing thing. </p>



<p>However, now that times have changed, major developers are pushing their employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-return-to-office-mandates-are-about-control-and-nothing-else/">back into the office</a>. Months ago, Rockstar issued a return-to-office order, stating that security was the driving reason for the change. Ubisoft also requested that employees head back into the many offices located around the world.</p>



<p>As financial concerns rose for some developers, the lack of workers in the office meant that many studios and locations were shut down, with companies opting to scrap offices to recoup some losses rather than force employees back into them.</p>



<p>In a new report, it has been explained that Techland is bringing employees back into the office with a few caveats. This report was published <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-moving-most-roles-to-on-site-or-hybrid-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesIndustry</a>, with Techland explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While remote work remains an option, we’re transitioning most roles to either an on-site or hybrid model. Employees who live near our offices will be asked to work from the office three days a week. For those working remotely from abroad, we’re asking them to come to the office regularly to foster stronger connections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was claimed in <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/techland-konczy-z-praca-zdalna-pracownicy-zmiana-wprowadzona-nagle-i-bez-konsultacji" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the initial report</a> that access to videoconferencing facilities and even toilets are restricted in Techland’s offices, especially when ‘too many’ staff are working on-site. Presently, Techland’s teams are working on an open-world fantasy RPG that’s yet to be revealed in full, but the company is best known for Dying Light, a post-apocalyptic, zombie-slashing series that debuted in 2015.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The First Descendant Racked Up 10 Million Players in One Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-10-million-players/</link>

<p>The First Descendant, a free-to-play ‘looter shooter’ from Nexon, was released on July 2 to mixed reviews. For many, it felt like it was a rehash of some other titles, namely Destiny and Warframe, and the most recent topic of debate is circulating around whether or not Nexon simply flipped assets or plagiarised Bungie’s sci-fi shooter in a few ways while creating The First Descendant.</p>



<p>Despite the meddling controversies, it seems The First Descendant has been a whopping success. Nexon recently revealed that 10 million players found their way into the game across all platforms in just one week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-it-free-and-that-ll-happen">Make It Free and That’ll Happen</h2>



<p>Much of the success of The First Descendant can be attributed to the fact that the game doesn’t cost a penny to play. That alone will entice millions of players. The real test is keeping those players engaged – you can bet your last dollar that the player count will crash after just a couple of weeks on the market.</p>



<p>In a post on X, Nexon wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached 10 million Descendants in just 7 days! Thank you all for your tremendous support and love. It means everything to us. We will do our best to bring you great experiences. Can’t wait to continue this journey together!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free-to-play, live-service title has had some teething issues, with players issuing mixed reviews across the board. It’s no big secret that The First Descendant operates a fairly expansive monetisation model that has packed the game to the brim with microtransactions, but by now, that’s part and parcel of the free-to-play life. </p>



<p>Plenty of comments have also been made regarding some of the character designs in The First Descendant. Instead of a solid story or satisfying quests, Nexon opted to include beautiful character models, some of which boast revealing outfits that rival Stellar Blade’s Eve. It takes more than an attractive group of playable characters to pull the wool over the eyes of the gaming community these days.</p>
