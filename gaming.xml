			<p>The new DLC for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, Mask of Darkness, is pure evil. Sadistic even. Without doubt it has proven to be one of the most challenging, most arduous, most masochistic video game experiences of my life. Thrilling in places, deeply frustrating in others, I certainly didn’t enjoy every moment of it, but what I can say is that I survived it and was immensely satisfied in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown - Mask of Darkness |DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVZirQWSlD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For all those who didn’t find the brilliant Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown challenging enough – what is wrong with you? That last boss almost broke me – then the Mask of Darkness DLC is undoubtedly for you. Accessible from a few hours into the main game, this DLC takes the form of an optional side quest. Sargon is tasked with hunting down the mysterious masked Immortal Radjen. Unfortunately, our hapless hero is tricked and ends up trapped in Radjen’s mind palace, an entirely separate map, cut off from the labyrinthian environment of Mount Qaf that we have all grown so familiar with.</p>


<p>The player is immediately stripped of the majority of Sargon’s abilities and health boosts. Essentially, you end up with the bog-standard vanilla version of the protagonist. Two exceptions remain: a dash and the teleport. It took some time to adjust to not having a double jump anymore; Sargon plunging to his death on more occasions than I care to recount due to my muscle memory kicking in. On the plus side, entirely new amulets can be found and returned with to the main game. One notable example, with which your Chakram is turned into a vampire, absorbing health from enemies to return to the player, is an unbelievably handy addition.</p>


<p>With Sargon thoroughly debuffed, what follows is one of the most brutal, yet finely honed, platforming challenges I’ve ever encountered. From the first stretch, where Sargon is chased by a giant evil eye that will instant kill him on contact, this DLC is clearly a very different beast from the original game. You should prepare to die. A lot. The precision platforming required can often feel overwhelming, yet, due to the thorough and immaculate design work, there is always a way through. A way that often surprises you with its ease to implement once you see it. Yet, before that, there is a lot of trial and error – particularly when it comes to those irritating platforms that only disappear after you leave their surface – and that certainly won’t be to everyone’s taste.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, Radjen’s mind palace stands out from the varied biomes of Mount Qaf. This is a far darker, eminently sinister, environment. One with huge symbiote-like tendrils infecting it, twisting and suffocating each vast landscape you encounter. There are some new baddies to bash, of course. Most enjoyable are the mechanical spinning blade drones that you can deflect into the unsuspecting faces of other foes, most satisfying indeed.<br>
</p>
<p>There are also supposedly four bosses to be killed by, though that number is rather disingenuous, as one of the four is little more than a powered-up regular warrior with a life bar. Radjen though, proves to offer a phenomenal, if disparagingly difficult, final challenge. One which will test your reflexes like nothing else in the main game. You also unlock a further boss battle upon completion of the mind Palace. Suffice to say it’s a great ultimate smackdown against an old mentor.</p>
<p>Despite the hugely difficult challenge that Mark of Darkness offers, it is entirely doable thanks to Ubisoft’s generous suite of accessibility options. Nearly ever facet of the game can be tinkered with. From being able to summon portals to instantly navigate nasty platforming sections or by reducing enemy attack damage to virtually nothing. So effective are these gameplay easers, that even this aged and slightly inept gamer was able to see things through to completion.</p>
<p>For under a fiver and with around five to six hours of content, the Mask of Darkness is practically an essential addition for fans of The Lost Crown. Offering an intense experience; as well as a surprisingly compelling story that fills in many of the blanks from the original game. Recommended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni have announced that Assetto Corsa EVO will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Early Access</a> as of January 16, 2025. This game is the latest evolution in the iconic Assetto Corsa series and is said to represent a major leap forward in the universe by offering a "significantly enriched sim-racing experience."&nbsp; Much like previous games in the franchise, Assetto Corsa EVO will include cars from different classes, showcasing years of motoring history. These cars will include road cars, classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>Using KUNOS Simulazioni's new proprietary engine, the feeling of driving these cars in-game will be able to more accurately simulate the mechanical, electronic and aerodynamic feel of driving a car at high speeds, helping to provide a new sense of realism to the franchise.</p>
<p>This game in particular will be supporting a full 24-hr race cycle, with new cutting-edge lighting, dynamic weather, track conditions and photorealistic visuals, which are all boosted using the new engine created by KUNOS.</p>
<p>"We know you've been eagerly awaiting news on Assetto Corsa EVO launch and trust us<em> —&nbsp;</em>we've been working hard to make sure everything meets our high standards. Here at KUNOS, we believe in taking the time to get things just right, and that's why the Early Access for Assetto Corsa EVO will officially begin on January 16, 2025," said Marco Massarutto, KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder and Executive Manager.</p>
<p>To support the news of Assetto Corsa EVO's Early Access launch, the developers released a new trailer, which features in-game footage for the first time. The trailer is just under two minutes long, and it credits companies such as Porsche, Alfa Romeo, Rseat, and Bell Helmets in the description, as they are partnered up with KUNOS Simulazioni to be able to create Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uOkigs9hnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, there is no price given for how much Assetto Corsa EVO will cost when it launches, but based off of previous launches of games in the Assetto Corsa franchise, it's expected it'll be around the 40 to 50 dollar mark, but that could be subject to change, especially once the game leaves Early Access. It isn't stated how long they are planning on the game being in Early Access, but hopefully, the feedback during that time will be beneficial in giving players the best sim-racing experience.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a sale on the<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-added-to-assetto-corsa-thanks-to-csp-mod/"> Assetto Corsa</a> games across multiple platforms, including all of the DLCs for the games. Assetto Corsa Competizione, the most recent game to be released on Steam in the franchise is currently available for $11.99, which is a huge 70% discount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sabotage Studio has announced the release date for the upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>Dawn of Equinox update, which is bringing three-player local co-op, new combat systems, and more.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the update, which lands on November 12th across all platforms, is distinct from the game's upcoming free&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>DLC, which we got to learn about during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct shows</a>.</p>
<p>Like that DLC, however, this update is completely free. The first major feature it's bringing is local three-player co-op, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-darling-rpg-sea-of-stars-achieves-5-million-players-couch-co-op-revealed">first revealed for the game back in March</a> (when we also learned&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>had hit the five million player count).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=x3knLc99 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-update-combat.jpg?itok=y2SR2Oed 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>will soon support three-player co-op.</figcaption></figure><p>The new multiplayer mode will not only let you traverse the world with your friends, but will also introduce a new Co-op Timed Hits mechanic, which will need you and your friends to be on your toes in combat.</p>
<p>As well as multiplayer, you're also getting new Mystery Locks in combat, which will need to be revealed in order to figure out which abilities you should use against certain foes. Combo Points will no longer be lost after battle, either, allowing you to experiment with new ways to approach different encounters.</p>
<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' prologue has been revamped as well; it no longer plays out in flashback, instead opening directly on the heroes' childhood in order to get you into the action more quickly.</p>
<p>A number of other new features have also been included as part of the Dawn of Equinox update, including new difficulty presets, improvements to the Parrot relic, and a bonus cinematic to "accentuate a pivotal moment in the original adventure".</p>

<p><em>Sea of Stars</em>' Dawn of Equinox update arrives ahead of&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em>, a free DLC intended for release in 2025. Said DLC will add a new playable character, a new storyline, and more, and is intended to serve as an "encore" to the original game.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sea-of-stars/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sea-of-stars/9NLLTTJZH40L" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sea-of-stars-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>The long-running chief of the Tekken series, Katsuhiro Harada, once tried to convince KFC to let him use Colonel Sanders as a character in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a>, according to an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/">TheGamer</a>. "[They] weren't very open to the idea," added game designer Michael Murray, who sat in on the interview. "[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them."</p>
<p>Never mind, Harada. Here's a few other corporate characters you could try to squeeze into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>.</p>

<h2>Gritty</h2>

<p>The wide-eyed mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3TENrrlOyw">no stranger to violence</a>. He is agile, powerful, and fully media trained. There really is no reason why this could not happen.</p>
<h2>Mr Muscle</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-2-mr-muscle.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>Ah, but which incarnation of the bleach-but-not-blond hero would best fit the Tekken mould? The modern CGI gym bro in orange spandex is the obvious choice, since it fits in with the game's narrow range of body types. But the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tquSbZEP-g">boxer-wearing beanpole of the 1990s</a> may offer variety. Yes, the Mr Muscle of today is a reboot. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but for toilet cleaner.  </p>
<h2>The Annoying Singer From The Go Compare Ads</h2>
<figure>

<p>In lieu of oversized biffer Bob, this may be a good fit. He is appropriately zany, kooky, <em>and</em> wacky. He can sing his jingle at the start and end of every fight, earning Bandai Namco literally dozens of British pounds in advertising revenue. What's not to like?</p>
<h2>The Monopoly Man</h2>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tekken-8-kfc-mascots-list-3-monopoly.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>God, I'd love to punch him.

<p>Her laugh will make an excellent mid-game taunt, and her fondness for showing off her earrings (cheese) puts her firmly into the Tekken developer's archetypal realm of "women wot punch and like fashion". Her bovine body may prove a challenge. But this is a series that has had a bear, a dinosaur, a kangaroo, and another, smaller dinosaur. I'm sure they can manage. </p>
<h2>Clippy</h2>

<p>Lots of room for puns in the post-game gloat with this guy. "I'm going to batter you!" or "I can weather any wave-dash!" or "King of the Iron <em>Fish</em> Tournament? That's me!" He could have a farcical side story with Kuma, all about the Captain's salmon stock going missing. Oh, Kuma! You big silly, greedy bear.</p>
<h2>The Andrex Puppy</h2>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kimberly-Clark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A literal underdog, the Andrex Puppy would need to be redesigned from the ground up to be viable in the meta. A ranged attack where he throws endless rolls of shit tickets at opponents. Several powerful unblockable charge attacks. This is all surely achievable from a legal and corporate perspective. Surely. </p>
<h2>Quaker Oats Guy</h2>

<p>Look at him. Look at all that repressed rage. He is not coming out of the ring until you are fully dead. </p>
<h2>Julius Pringles</h2>

<p>Hang on a minute... Julius!? This guy has a name and it is <em>Julius</em>? Also, hey! This is just the Monopoly man's younger brother! That family's got their fingers in everything. Disgusting. Another condemnation of capitalism's salty, powdery excess. I'm done with this stupid list.</p>

Developed by Yustas and published by Wall World and Beholder outfit Alawar, it casts you as an AI mayor, Iris, who is trying to create the perfect city in a world of social and economic calamity. A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.</p>

<p>Iris is both helped and hindered in this endeavour by four human factions - "capitalists, aristocrats, politicians, and the common people". I hail from the UK, where aristocrats tend also to be capitalists and politicians, so I'm tempted to reword this as "the common people, plus a bunch of grasping, untrustworthy bastards". Technotopia is out 16th October, and I've got a trailer full of soothing background music for you, below.</p>

<p>You'll sculpt your metropolis by means of playing cards, using them to grow skyscrapers, parks, residential districts and transport highways from spectral, unfurnished map tiles. The presentation here reminds me slightly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries Of Titan</a>, though it doesn't look like you can tunnel inside buildings to rearrange the fittings.</p>
<p>While dealing from and upgrading your deck, you'll manage sets of coloured resources and field dialogue requests from faction members and other characters - these include "hackers, oligarchs, criminals and inventors". Some of the problems you'll face appear systemic in nature, while others are story beats triggered by certain conditions. Here's a rundown of the features, lifted from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825110/Technotopia/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>    • 4 faction-driven questlines: Each with its own unique story, shaping the city's destiny.</p>
<p>    • 100+ unique buildings: Each structure offers distinct bonuses, influencing the balance of power within the city.</p>
<p>    • 4 building combinations: Discover new ways to strategically combine city blocks for maximum impact. </p>
<p>    • 50+ dynamic events: Every event is influenced by your decisions, with outcomes that ripple throughout the city. </p>
<p>    • Factions' influence: Every choice you make shifts the power dynamics, affecting how events unfold and who controls the city.</p>
<p>    • Criminal activity: As crime levels rise, new challenges and unique events appear, forcing you to make tough, high-stakes choices. </p>
<p>    • City news: Stay informed on how your actions are shaping the city and its people in real time. </p>
<p>    • Memory cubes: Scattered across the city, collecting these will unlock bonuses and insights that aid your journey.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I must confess, when I first saw this I had it confused with Arcen Games's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/">Heart Of The Machine</a>, a turn-based sci-fi 4X published by the always-dependable Hooded Horse. It has broadly the same premise, but is a lot more complex and fiddly, with the option to *squints* "unleash a pack of genetically modified velociraptors upon the rich". Yeah, I'm pretty sure Frostpunk 2 doesn't have that either. I guess we'll post about Heart Of The Machine too at some stage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/aew-strongly-considering-new-partner-for-future-video-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The future of AEW video games currently hangs in the balance.</p>



<p>Multiple sources have told me that the decision makers at AEW are “strongly considering” finding a new development partner moving forward. This comes after numerous issues surrounding the game’s development.</p>



<p>“They [AEW] knows that things didn’t go the way they expected,” one source said. “The game was over-budget and it under delivered when it came out. It has AEW strongly considering moving to a new developer for their games.”</p>



<p>AEW Fight Forever launched in June 2023 to mixed response. While the gameplay was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/aew-fight-forever-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun and easy to pick up</a>, the lack of depth and various bugs was a turnoff for many players. In April 2024, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/aew-fight-forever-delayed-further-budget-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was told that there was pressure</a> on the developers to “deliver something faster than what it should’ve been”.</p>



<p>Now, AEW is trying to figure out where to go with their games. The original contract with Yuke’s called for one year of post launch updates which came in the form of four season passes that added wrestlers, moves, game modes, and venues. The last DLC pack game out in July, adding Jay White to the roster. There have been talks for releasing recently signed wrestlers Will Ospreay, Kazuchika Okada, and Mercedes Mone to the game’s roster, but it’s unclear where those talks between AEW and Yuke’s stand.</p>



<p>The sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity say that the primary focus is around the gaming future as a whole. </p>



<p>“Everything is on the table,” Insider Gaming was told. “There were some positives with the Yuke’s relationship, and some feel that with a foundation in place, another game could make things better rather than giving up after one attempt. But you can’t argue that there are concerns with how things went in the final year of the game’s development.” </p>



<h2 id="h-issues-from-the-start">Issues From The Start</h2>



<p>Issues with Yuke’s and AEW date back to before Fight Forever was released. There was a lot of <a href="https://www.sportsgamersonline.com/games/aew-yukes-butting-heads-over-aew-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">butting heads between</a> both sides, including involving AEW executive vice president Kenny Omega. At one point, I was told Omega was frustrated to the point of “hating” working with Yuke’s while others felt that Yuke’s was trying to “take advantage” of Omega due to his inexperience around helping with game development. </p>



<p>“No one was really happy when the game came out,” a source said. “Even before launch, internal talks started about whether to continue with the game with Yuke’s, bring it over to a new developer and either build on what’s been done or start from scratch, or leave the console market and continue to focus on mobile.</p>



<p>“A lot of people in the company want another shot with a console game, but it only matters if the one signing the checks wants to trust them again.”</p>



<p>When asked where that sits, I was told, “No one knows.”</p>



<p>AEW owns the engine used for Fight Forever, and can bring it over to a new developer if they wanted to build on top of what was made. It’s unlikely that, after Fight Forever went well over budget and didn’t turn a profit, the company would look to have another game built from scratch. But that comes down to the kind of deal made with a new partner.</p>



<p>It’s important to clarify that these are currently in the discussions stage. No final decision has been made by AEW regarding a new partner or if there will even be a new game any time soon. </p>



<p>“There are feelers out to some of the larger developers in the space, including some obvious ones, to see what the interest in wrestling games are,” it was said. “They are doing their due diligence before any decision is made.”</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for AEW video games? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/621/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

"So, I asked to use Colonel Sanders and go to the head office in Japan."</p><p>Unfortunately, Harada’s pitch was turned down with a "bad look.” Since then, Colonel Sanders actually did appear in a video game: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/i-love-you-colonel-sanders-a-finger-lickin-good-dating-simulator">I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin' Good Dating Simulator</a>, a dating sim commissioned by KFC and released for free on Steam on September 24, 2019 as a bizarre promo for the fast food chain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"[Harada] went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and tried to get Colonel Sanders," game designer Michael Murray added. "They weren't very open to the idea.</p><p>"[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them. But it just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are."</p><p>So, no Colonel Sanders. But what about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">that Waffle House stage Tekken fans are desperate for</a>? "It's not something that we can accomplish on our own," Harada said, pointing to the need for Waffle House’s unlikely approval for such a DLC.</p><p>Still, Tekken 8 fans do have the game’s third DLC character, Heihachi Mishima, to look forward to. The once-dead fighting veteran joins the roster as part of the upcoming free story expansion for Tekken 8, titled <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-unforgotten-echoes-and-heihachi-mishima-hands-on-impressions">Unforgotten Echoes</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Have you ever fallen into a black hole?”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via indie.io:</p><blockquote><p>Players will step into the space suit of an astronaut on the Silver Globe, embarking on an epic interstellar first-person shooter adventure when it turns out that there is more on the Moon than just rocks and resources. </p><p><em>Moon Mystery</em> starts at humanity’s crowning achievement, a research outpost on the surface of the Moon, and the first step towards traveling across the Solar System and further among the stars, realizing humanity’s age-old ambition. Players step into the high-tech suit of an astro-geologist researching exotic materials on the Moon’s surface that could make this dream a reality, assisted by TOBY (Technical-Overseer-Bionically-Improved). The adventure starts when something goes terribly wrong and all contact with Earth is lost.</p><p>Stranded on the lunar surface, players will have to use their wits to survive the most hostile environment visited by human beings, crossing vast landscapes and exploring abandoned facilities left behind by previous missions to the Moon. But merely surviving and exploring will not be enough: Soon, the adventure will take them across vast interstellar spaces, where no man has gone before. Players will face technology gone rogue, master controllable vehicles from tiny RC cars to spaceships and even submarines, and adapt to evolving environments. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Moon Mystery</em> starts on the silver globe, but will end far away from humanity’s home. Each new environment offers new challenges: New vehicles to master, new enemies to overcome, and of course, ever-evolving environmental puzzles and platforming sequences that will require the players to constantly adapt to new twists and turns in the experience.</p><p>Cosmoscouts is an independent Polish studio headquartered in Warsaw, founded to bring <em>Moon Mystery</em> to the players. What originated as one man’s after-hours hobby in 2022 blossomed into a full-size game with a small, but passionate group of developers creating the kind of adventure they always wanted to play. This passion was recognized on Kickstarter, where it was featured as a Project [Kickstarter] Loves and exceeded its initial funding goal.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Moon Mystery - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySbkiIjxLRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next project from the Horizon studio Guerrilla Games is reportedly an online game, and the third single-player entry in the series is still a while away.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/R0A0ZEJ8dYE?si=38Xf2P_h_w9gEoUj&amp;t=3323" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spawn Wave podcast</a>, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier said, "Horizon Online is [Guerrilla's] next project, not whatever the third single-player game looks like. So that one might be a ways off." Schreier also said that PlayStation's live-service initiative was "no joke" and that this Horizon online project is one of the few ones that hasn't been already canceled or flopped like Concord did.</p><p>Sony is leaning into the Horizon franchise heavily with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-get-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-for-20-if-youre-a-new-player/1100-6526779/" data-ref-id="1100-6526779">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-631814">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. The former adds visual fidelity on par with the PS5's capabilities as well as accessibility options. The latter is a family-friendly version of the game with an emphasis on co-op. It's also the first PlayStation Studios game to get a release on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Sony's live-service initiative has been a mixed bag so far.

<p>"The update represents Sabotage Studio's fully realised vision for Sea of Stars' spectacular adventure," the studio wrote in a post accompanying today's announcement.</p>
<p>Dawn of Equinox is set to arrive across PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on 12th November. More details can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the update's release, Sabotage Studio is hosting a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sabotagestudio">Twitch livestream</a> tomorrow, 1st October, at 2pm ET. That's 7pm UK. It will offer an "in-depth look" at all the new bits and pieces of content coming to Sea of Stars.</p>

<p>In addition to Dawn of Equinox, Sabotage Studio has a Sea of Stars DLC in the pipeline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Throes of the Watchmaker</a>, as it's known, will be released across all platforms in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>"Throes of the Watchmaker will find Sea of Stars' leading heroes Valere and Zale venturing into a magical miniature clockwork world threatened by a cursed carnival, which forces the Solstice Warriors to adapt to unfamiliar rules to fully master their Sun and Moon powers," the DLC's official blurb reads.</p>
<p>For more, our Ed spoke with composer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">Eric W. Brown and director Thierry Boulanger about composing the game's nostalgic, retro score</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is going to get an early access release KUNOS Simulazioni and 505 Games has announced, but it will just be missing out a 2024 release window. Instead, Assetto Corsa EVO will be available on Steam Early Access from January 16th, 2025, and you can wishlist it right now by going clicking on the link, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/">Assetto Corsa EVO on Steam</a>. An announcement trailer for the game has also been released.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/assetto-corsa-evo-aims-to-redefine/">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> was actually revealed back in June, with KUNOS Simulazioni confirming that it would be moving to a similar format to the original Assetto Corsa.</p>
<p><em>“We know you’ve been eagerly awaiting news on&nbsp;Assetto Corsa EVOlaunch, and trust us —we’ve been working hard to make sure everything meets our high standards. Here at KUNOS, we believe in taking the time to get things just right, and that’s why the Early Access for Assetto Corsa EVO will officially begin on January 16, 2025.”</em> said Marco Massarutto, KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder and Executive Manager.<em>&nbsp;“Our goal is to ensure the quality that all sim racing enthusiasts rightfully expect from a title like Assetto Corsa EVO. We would like to express our sincere gratitude for the continuous and extraordinary support received from our community. We look&nbsp; forward to sharing more exciting news on the project soon!”</em></p>
<p>The game will include cars from multiple classes and so will include road cars, classics, hypercars, prototypes and racing cars. The game will also feature 24 hour cycles with dynamic weather which will impact track conditions and car performance. Assetto Corsa EVO will also be created in new proprietary engine that will allow for photorealistic graphics. From the original announcement, some of the tracks that were seen included &nbsp;Imola, Nurburgring Nordschleife and Brands Hatch. The cars that were spotted included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alpine A110</li>
<li>Alpine A290_β</li>
<li>Hyundai N Vision 74</li>
<li>Hyundai i20 N</li>
<li>Hyundai i30 N</li>
<li><span>Lamborghini Huracán STO</span></li>

<p>In our Assetto Corsa Competizione review, Stefan said, “Where the original console release of Assetto Corsa Competizione had some huge caveats hanging over it, the game’s release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S brings it up to spec, effectively matching the PC version. It still has some weaknesses in presentation and structure for new players in particular, but once you get into the groove, it’s one of the best sim racers you can buy right now.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest installment of the management sim series is hitting PC and consoles in November.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-launching-november-26" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will arrive first on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 on November 26th, and that a mobile version of the game, namely&nbsp;<em>FM25 Mobile</em>, will arrive via Netflix Games on the same day.</p>
<p><em>FM25 Touch</em>, a version of the game for the Nintendo Switch, will then follow on December 3rd, and Sports Interactive and Sega say they'll reveal more information about&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>Touch "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=0Tq6ZarL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-release-date-players.jpg?itok=qsG-RgfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will feature a fully-licensed Premier League for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>As has been previously revealed,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will be the first game in the series to feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">full licensing for the Premier League</a>, so you won't need to spend hours editing your favorite teams anymore.</p>
<p>It's also making a switch to the Unity engine, which Sports Interactive says will power "the new era for football management", creating "a deeper, more authentic football universe". I'll be using "football" rather than "soccer" here, by the way. Blame my Britishness.</p>
<p>However, this newest installment will also lack the Create-a-Club feature, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">several other core franchise features</a>, including Touchline Shouts and the Data Chalkboard.</p>
<p>A number of new features will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>, however, including the debut of women's football, overhauled tactics, and "a complete revamp of the way to set up your manager", which Sports Interactive says will lead to "more customized, unique stories".</p>

<p>In the weeks between now and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>'s release, Sega and Sports Interactive will be <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/roadmap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drip-feeding new information</a> about the game, including info about key features, new additions, and more.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will appear seem a little confusing. On its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/buy-fm25?game=fm25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order page</a>, the game appears to be available for "Xbox", which seemingly includes Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, its <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/games/football-manager-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> simply shows images of the Xbox Series X and the PS5 under the console heading, so if you're looking to play the game on Xbox One, you may want to hold off pre-ordering. It's definitely not coming to PS4, though. Sorry, PS4 players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is returning for its third season on Amazon Prime. Ahead of its release TechRaptor, along with a number of other outlets, had a chance to sit down and ask the core cast of Critical Role about the experience of revisiting Vox Machina once more and the task of adapting the campaign further into the TV show.</p>
<p><strong>While there are no direct spoilers a number of features about Season 3 are teased related to locations and plot, if you want to go into this season completely blind then be sure to bookmark this article and return once <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 has completely released by October 24th.</strong></p>
<h2>What Fans of<em> The Legend of Vox Machina</em> S3 Can Look Forward To</h2>
<p>To begin Matthew Mercer, CCO and Dungeon Master at Critical Role, took a moment to explain the premise of the upcoming third season. "Vox Machina are still rallying against the Chroma Conclave, they managed to fell one of their numbers but others exist. There's a possible dubious conversation with one of them, there's all sorts of weird mingled stuff there, but as the search for these Vestigaes continues, part of it leads them to hell."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=-_97dQpi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell.jpg?itok=yQWOpiW- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking further about Vox Machina's travels to hell Mercer expanded, "It was part of the campaign to a degree and we've been able to expand upon that in some really fun and unique and surprising ways. We've gotten to spotlight some of the non-Vox Machina characters and spend more time with them."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For those not familiar with the campaign there will be a lot of really cool familiar moments and some very unique and surprising ones" - Matthew Mercer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excited for what fans, new and old, are going to see, Liam O'Brien talked a bit about the anticipation that the cast is feeling. "There are massive moments that are going to sideswipe the audience and we're just waiting in the wings for it to slide onto stage," he gestured with his hands, something coming into frame. "You're not going to be disappointed."</p>
<p>A bit of a more direct tease, Taliesin Jaffe jumped in to say "I'm excited for the cleverest thing for Laura Bailey has said in Campaign One and that's all I'm going to say." As I, and I'm sure others in the room, began scrambling through their memories of what he could be referencing Sam Riegal asked "Is it a poop joke?", Jaffe quickly swatted away that idea. While we still can't be too sure what moment Jaffe was thinking of we at least know it's not that.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=kzNX0a3M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy.jpg?itok=r87-s7PT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Lot Of The Same, But Also New</h2>
<p>Talking deeper about the changes that some fans of the original campaign may recognize, Willingham explained that "Season Three is a big divergence for our characters. I think part of it, as we were considering story beats and how we want the show to approach this culmination with the Chroma Conclave we're always looking for ways to improve or economize, or even put a new shine on some moments now that we have a second chance at telling them, but we're also trying to tee things up for down the road, not just in this show but also in the Mighty Nein. We've had years and years of gameplay since these episodes were played the very first time and so we're always trying to go back and seed things early if we can and provide something new for an audience that thinks they know what to expect, we can unsettle them just a bit."</p>
<p>When asking the cast who felt they had the largest divergence Marisha Ray volunteered Johnson's character Pike Trickfoot. "We definitely did a lot of adjusting to Pike and I think that continues throughout the rest of the shows." During the original campaign due to scheduling conflicts with Johnson's work on Blindspot Pike would frequently come in and out of story arcs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know personally I'm so excited to just retroactively have more Ashley Johnson" - Marisha Ray</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson talked about how she was excited that there are so many moment now "specifically with Pike. Getting to see where we could have gone with the story had I been at the table. Also where we are going with the story in the animated series and how Pike can sort of fit in there. We looked for ways in a series with hundreds of hours that we have to truncate into an episode or 12 episodes and it feels really cool because I feel like I get to do things I really didn't get to do at the table and to get to go to places. I get to go to hell which is going to be really fun."</p>

<p>"I think that the character we got to alter the most is Vox Machina as a group," Riegel began "from the campaign to the screen we go to different places in different orders, we split up in different ways that we didn't do in the campaign, we reunite in different ways and so really the whole linear arc of the season differs from the campaign a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Also characters that aren't main Vox Machina characters like Kima and Allura, we focus on them in ways this season that they never got that spotlight in the campaign and it's really fun to look at these characters, beloved characters, that didn't get their own campaign episode but now they get their own episode in the animated series."</p>
<h2>Recording Trials, Tribulations, and Tomfoolery From A Decade Ago</h2>
<p>"We get to pick and choose where we want to go and the moments we get to highlight," Jaffe began to explain on the topic of time in the recording booth. He highlighted just how different the situation was when they were roleplaying at a table making decisions on the fly and with the show they're able to revisit every moment and dial it up for drama.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-keyleth.jpg?itok=DodDV3Au 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-keyleth.jpg?itok=60EnOsb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"It is this delight going in there and having that memory of the first time we were pulling this out of our butts, now allowing it to become drama, and comedy, and knowing that when we actually see it on screen it's somehow always better than it was in my head, other than in my head Vex is always hotter" Jaffe added, playing on the romance between his character, Percy de Rolo, and Bailey's character, Vex'ahlia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's really amazing to be able to give these moments to artists and then just watch it blossom"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the experience in the booth, reliving emotions from years ago Ray jumped into the discussion "I think at the table too, when we're in these moments all of these emotions are real. We're acting in real-time so going back and revisiting them it's still just as emotionally impactful and it is not uncommon to cry… a lot… and then you're exhausted for the rest of the day because you cried in your morning session. It's still so emotionally palpable ten years later almost."</p>
<p>Bailey remarked that she believes that when they were playing this game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons a decade ago they didn't realize just how much emotion they could bring to the story. "We were a little timid about fully going there emotionally, it's so wonderful in the animated series to allow ourselves to dive in to those really deep moments."</p>
<p>As each cast member became quite introspective of the emotions that each of their characters had gone through and the effort it took to portray that O'Brien also highlighted the time in the recording booth that they were able to spend together. "We have so many responsibilities too, we're organizing so much and tracking so much and writing and producing, the time we get together with a ring of microphones and we get to make each other laugh and cry is a playspace, a place of dream and imagination. I'm so excited the mornings I get to wake up and we're heading off to the studios, I don't ever want it to end, I love being in the Holodeck."</p>

<p>What you see on the screen of Season 3 continues to push the envelope in terms of adult animation. Speaking on their collaboration with Titmouse – whose work includes not only <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, but also Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Boys Presents: Diabolical – Willingham made sure to point out all of the incredible work being done.</p>
<p>"We have amazing partners with Titmouse Animation and it's been important to us form the beginning to really push what this Adult animated show can be so we have incredible episodic directors, board artists, supervising producers that come in and help us push the envelope at every turn. Even when we think we write something that's un-producable or un-animatable they kinda look back and say 'bet' and just blow us away."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak-flames.jpg?itok=_pVnWSiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak-flames.jpg?itok=aeUGgJ8k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ray added a note based on not only how violent the show is, but how the relationships between different characters begin to bloom this season "The romance was there in the original, we just couldn't show it because of Twitch ToS"</p>
<p>The cast burst into laughter making jokes about how without the ToS there would have been constant 30 minute romance scenes.</p>
<p>"I think it was heavily implied that Vex and Percy were doing so much boning." Ray continued "So now we just get to show it!"</p>
<p>Talking more about the core of the relationships, and a bit further away from the boning Jaffe brought up that he and Bailey had talked about their character's relationships at the time and were proud because "it's rare in television to see what feels like a real relationship and this is something I'm really proud of in what we're doing. These feel, at least to me, a lot more honest in the sorts of things that people talk about and deal with in especially stressful relationships."</p>
<h2>The Music Of <em>Vox Machina</em></h2>
<p>From music's original tie to <em>Vox Machina</em>, in Scanlan's bardic performances we've seen hit songs like "The Legend of Vox Machina", "Scanlan's Sphinx Song", and "Pull My Beads of Love" come out of each season of the show.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what the process was like for identifying where a song should be added and what the process was like to create them. Sam Reigel, Scanlan's creator and voice actor, explained "In season 3 we're going to continue what we've done in prior seasons where there are fun songs that help to carry the vibe and there are some important songs that deal with plot and are integral and this season we actually rely on Matt Mercer more to provide us with some vocals this season in two key moments in the Season. One you might not even recognize that it's Matt's voice but it's in a pivotal emotionally gutting moment in the season and Matt sings a song that will, I hope, break your heart and then he gets to sing in character also in a totally different episode so I'm excited. I'm always excited when we get songs from characters that are not me, although I love me I also love these guys and they're so talented."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo.jpg?itok=s6skTqmz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo.jpg?itok=6pcgLHNl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A few chuckles were heard from other members of the cast including Ashley Johnson and Travis Willingham as Reigel professed his love for himself.</p>
<p>Mercer added that from his perspective "A lot of it was just playful banter in the writers room about what moments could be musical. The majority of it was Sam and the folks from production…" Mercer trailed off for a moment before doubling back "Mostly Sam and Peter basically coming up with ridiculous ideas of where to fit songs both mid-episode versus end-credit bits."</p>
<h2><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Isn't Too Far Away</h2>
<p>While the conversation mostly focused on <em>Vox Machina</em> the cast of Critical Role wasn't going to get away without a further hint about the upcoming Mighty Nein TV Show, also coming to Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>After releasing an early animatic earlier this year when asked if any more news could be given about it's release Bailey and O'Brien deflected into playful banter between their characters Jester Lavorre and Caleb Widogast about how many dick jokes there will be.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=SPa34SaF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mighty-nein.jpg?itok=lqkAxryP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Locking in for a more serious answer O'Brien rattled off a few themes for the season including "Spy thriller, grief, thick action, budding love." From that Bailey added that "it's a story from a different perspective, that we didn't get to see in the campaign."</p>
<p>Willingham also added "One of the things we love about <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is that we get to spend so much time with our antagonists, more than maybe what we did during the live stream. One of the things we're looking forward to the most is seeing some of these villains that we will come to learn and to hate, to meet and maybe even love in some cases. As we've teased before we're visiting these characters from more of a session zero perspective which is how they've all started, come together as a group, and what it is that keeps them together. For some of the audience this will be entirely new material. Some things they may have heard of but never seen before. We're really excited to bring that to the screen for the first time."</p>

As someone whose favourite game is <em>Wind Waker</em>--and whose favourite bits of <em>Wind Waker </em>are the little chores you can perform on perfectly-formed little islands--this game feels like it was made just for me.</p><p>But what really struck me about <em>Caravan Sandwitch </em>is that it knows its scale and its scope. It's a sandbox game that is fully aware of the limitations of what that genre is increasingly known for--tedium and bloat, mostly--and ducks out on them altogether.</p><p><em>Caravan Sandwitch's</em> world is fully explorable, but it's a pretty small space. It has a cast of characters to chat with and run errands for, but not many; over the course of its six or so hours you'll get to know everyone. It has a few puzzles but not enough to overwhelm, some platforming that never frustrates and a lot of driving, but it's never too far.</p><p>It doesn't even have combat. Not a single punch or shot. This is an open world that's so uninterested in using fighting as a solution to problems--or a motivation for its story--that it doesn't feature hostiles, you don't have a health bar and can't die, not even if you fall from its highest peak.</p><p>This <em>could </em>feel reductive, like we're only playing parts of a game, but this isn't trying to be anything bigger. <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> is more interested in putting exploration and story in the spotlight, so that's what we get. The game is long enough to make us care about those things but short enough to stop it from feeling limited. By the time I was done with the game it had felt like the perfect little diversion. I'd been whisked away to a beautiful make-believe world, met some people, helped them out then rolled some credits, never once feeling stuck or cheated along the way.</p><figure></figure><p>Too many sandbox games these days feel like a sprawl, like you're drowning in tedium and empty space for the sake of a marketing bullet point boasting about the size of a map. Here, it feels weird to even call <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> a sandbox game at all. This feels more like a snowglobe, an approximation of something bigger, perfectly formed in miniature.</p><p>I don't want to sound like I'm reducing everything else here that's so good about this game, all its wonderful writing and visual craft, to a simple matter of me enjoying its scale and pacing, but that was just so important here! Because nobody outstayed (and nothing outplayed) their welcome, my memories of <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> are nothing but fond ones; I'll genuinely miss my little frog friends, the rooftop cafe, the whine of my busted old van that became my best friend over the course of my explorations.</p><p>I'll also miss the sweeping visuals, the beautiful countryside, the surprisingly slick soundtrack. Now that I'm done I'll just...miss everything about you, <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>. We parted on the very best of terms, and it's very rare I can say that about a video game, no matter its size or budget.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/football-manager-25-release-date-set-for-november-26th/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Football Manager 25 is going to be released on November 26th, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced today. The release of Football Manager 25 will be the start of new era for the series, with the game now running in Unity, and an overhaul of the user interface along with some omissions from the current games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sports Interactive’s Miles Jacobson said, “It’s a great honour today to be confirming the forthcoming release of Football Manager 25. As I’ve mentioned in interviews and development updates, the FM25 cycle has been challenging for the entire SI team. FM25 is just the starting point for the studio’s next 20, 30 years. It’s also the point where the world gets to see two of our multi-year projects come to fruition: the switch to the Unity engine and the introduction of Women’s Football. It gives us a real sense of achievement to begin sharing our hard work with you and we’re really looking forward to showing you more of the game in the weeks before the game’s release.”</p>
<p>One of the new features in Football Manager 25 include the Premier League license, and for the first ever time women’s teams can be managed. There are other major changes too. The matchday information screen has been redesigned with it&nbsp; showing the pitch taking centre stage, with both team tactical line ups on either side of it. Below these are the match stats, match events, and other match scores from around the league. Under all of that is the team line up with player condition. The new Portal system, has replaced the Inbox, which was seen as outdated and has been consigned to history. With the Portal you will have an Agenda list showing tasks that need to be completed, news from the football world, the calendar, and messages from everyone you interact with. Player form screens will show how an individual player has been performing, and their contributions in the last five matches.</p>

<p>While there are a lot of changes to how Football Manager 25 will run, there have also been major elements taken out. This includes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Fantasy Draft will be made available in Football Manager 25, but not at launch. Football Manager 25 Console edition will be be available for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 26th too, with the game coming to Game Pass day one. Football Manager 25 Mobile will also launch on November 26th, but as a Netflix exclusive, and Football Manager 25 Touch will be released for Nintendo Switch on December 3rd.</p>

		<p>Neon Blood, the neo-noir cyberpunk RPG, has been set a release date of November 26th, developer ChaoticBrain Studios and publisher Meridiem have confirmed. Alongside the release date news, Meridiem has also revealed that there will be a physical release for Neon Blood though this is limited to PS5 and Nintendo Switch.

<p>The story of Neon Blood is set in the year 2053 following World War Three, in which much of the world has been abandoned with people now living in a huge metropolis called Viridis, which itself is made up of two cities. There is Bright City, home to the upper echelons of society, and Blind City, where the poorer and downtrodden live. The main character is Axel McCoin, a detective from Blind City, who after seeing so many injustices is ready to rebel against the societal divide and lead a revolution. He will find allies who want to see the cause succeed, along with enemies who want to see it fail. One of those enemies is Ruby Emerald, who is introduced in the above trailer.</p>
<p>Neon Blood is an RPG which will feature puzzles to solve, conversations to navigate, and scenarios to investigate, all in the interest of bringing about revolution to Viridis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframes-koumei-the-five-fates-update-releasing-october-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As showcased at the Tokyo Game Show, the Warframe Devstream showcases the 58th playable namesake as well as a new game mode. Those watching the devstream were also notified of the hands-on demo for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/">Warframe: 1999</a>, which is launching October 16. In the live stream, Digital Extremes gave players a glance at the upcoming namesake warrior, Koumei the dice-maiden. This update will be debuting on all platforms as of October 2, where players will get to try out Koumei in-game. Koumei has an RNG inspired ability kit, and to develop her, Digital Extremes partnered up with Sumo Digital to create her and her abilities. In addition to Koumei, Sumo Digital also helped them develop a new Shrine Defense mission, which is an Infested mini-boss, Infested Oni, and a slew of quality-of-life improvements. This update comes with deluxe cosmetics for players to enjoy if they want to spruce up their aesthetics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Koumei &amp; the Five Fates Official Gameplay Trailer (Japanese Version ft. Kenjiro Tsuda)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6iblGunMnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"It was so surreal to be back in Tokyo to reveal a new Warframe to our Japanese community and our players around the world tuning in virtually. Traveling the glove this year to meet Tenno in person has been rejuvenating for the soul of our team as we trek on our path towards Warframe: 1999 this year. Until then, we hope everyone enjoys Koumei and optimizing her high skill-ceiling gameplay," says Megan Everett, Community Director.</p>
<p>Koumei has a six-sided dice that can be used in conjunction with her abilities. This includes the ability to thread together Kumihimo traps, which can inflict damage and random status ailments to the enemy based on the dice rolls. Koumei can also predict the future using Omikuji, which gives her a special buff.</p>
<p>As a defensive capability, she can summon Omamori charms which orbit her and can randomly convert damage into extra health or shields. Her ultimate ability is called Bunraku and it allows her to turn her enemies into marionettes and puppeteer them with status effects.</p>
<p>Added in conjunction with Koumei's release is the Shrine Defense, where players will have to gather shrine offerings and fight off Invested enemies until the Infested Oni shows up. During this mission, you'll be able to grab Koumei's crafting parts to add her to the Arsenal with her weaponry: A "gunbrella" called Higasa and a Naginata style polearm named Amanata.</p>
<p>Those who play Warframe will be able to get a <a href="https://www.warframe.com/1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on teaser demo</a> of Warframe: 1999, which will lead to a Protokol Longsword Skin for those who complete the chapter.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-blizzard-devs-horror-game-the-oily-depths-looks-like-single-player-lethal-company.996318/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Blizzard and Ubisoft staffer Ryan R. Burns has announced&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>, his debut project as a solo indie developer, and if you're into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>, you'll probably enjoy this one.</p>
<p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a "short horror game" set on a deep-sea submarine, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246512641903312897/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Burns' announcement</a>. Your goal is to locate oil deposits and drill for them, and if you don't do a satisfactory job, "your corporate overlords will stop your supply of oxygen".</p>
<p>There's something delightfully poetic about Burns, who's worked for both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">Ubisoft</a>, creating a game about how corporations will crush you without a second thought if you don't perform well enough for them, but perhaps I shouldn't read too much into that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-oily-depths-horror-submarine.jpg?itok=OqBsM2Oy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-oily-depths-horror-submarine.jpg?itok=zBPtD0BN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a horror game set aboard a deep-sea submarine.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>employs a lo-fi art style that's very similar to&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>'s, and it has similar themes of corporate indifference in the face of looming monstrous horror.</p>
<p>The difference, though - and it's a pretty big difference at that - is that&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>is a single-player experience, so you won't need to recruit any of your friends to enjoy this one with you.</p>
<p>You will, however, need to gain mastery over the tools at your disposal. Burns says you'll need to "flip levers, grab tools, set locking-arms, and more" if you want to escape from the deep-sea abyss with oil (and, more importantly, your sanity).</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>, which gives a good idea of what the game's atmosphere will be like, right here.</p>

<p>By the looks of things, you won't just be operating your sub and drilling for oil in&nbsp;<em>The Oily Depths</em>; you may also have to deal with monstrous creatures trying to sabotage your machines, so keep your wits about you.</p>
<p><em>The Oily Depths&nbsp;</em>can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlisted right now via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

On the subject of missing bots from <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, and<em> Nier</em>, Doucet was diplomatic about why they didn’t end up in the game. “It’s difficult to comment on that,” he said. “We really respect the choice of each publisher.” Other missing bots, like<em> Twisted Metal</em>’s psychopathic clown Sweet Tooth, were at Team Asobi’s discretion. “They advised us—they didn’t force us—and we agreed that it was better to leave this character out,” Doucet said citing conversations with former<em> Twisted Metal</em> devs. “Because, if you’re playing with your kids, we don’t want you to have to explain what this character does.”</p><p>Team Asobi recently revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690?_gl=1*pkjcrg*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzcwMjk3Ni4xMDcuMS4xNzI3NzA1MDQ4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690?_gl=1*pkjcrg*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzcwMjk3Ni4xMDcuMS4xNzI3NzA1MDQ4LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Astro Bot</em>’s first free expansion</a></span> at last week’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-1851656575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-ghost-of-tsushima-2-yotei-1851656575">State of Play showcase,</a></span> which will include additional bots representing <em>Helldivers</em> and <em>Stellar Blade</em> among others, as well as new speedrunning challenge levels.

Project lead Victor Rubenstein and his studio peers haven't been slaving away for all that time—the game began life in 2019 as a 1v1 collectible card game with a science fiction theme, and was meant to just be a 6-month side project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2021, he and co-founder Mike Conaway decided to enter full production—but not as a multiplayer game (he called the idea of doing so with a 2-person team "insane"), beginning a three-year journey to launching in Early Access this month. They did so without any formal game development training, which isn't an unusual story in 2024, but it is notable that they did so after going to school for architecture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And beyond that, they pulled it off while operating from the Romanian city of Timișoara, where they're apparently the only game development studio in town.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rubenstein told us this tale at Gamescom 2024, and explained how Edgeflow Studios explored a host of interesting design ideas to make its game stand out in a crowded genre.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Breachway"><span>Breachway</span> was made with "form follows function" in mind</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fair to compare </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to Mega Crit's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Both are run-based games where characters pick a "character" (a spaceship in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) with unique traits, then set out to traverse various nodes, encountering different obstacles and adding or removing cards to their deck along the way.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/what-the-heck-is-valve-doing-with-these-informal-deadlock-ndas-" target="_self">What the heck is Valve doing with these informal Deadlock NDAs?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also a bit of</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Subset Games' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FTL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cooked into the mix, with the physical assembly of the different ships impacting player decisions. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players load their ships with different weapons and equipment, which put different decks of cards in circulation. Those equipped objects are also displayed on the model of the ship, and can be targeted by enemies. The player also can target enemy upgrades, damaging or disabling them to secure victory. Which characters operate which systems also plays a major role.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s eye-catching ship models are a part of the appeal (the game's Next Fest demo racked up a number of players in advance of its recent Early Access launch). Robinson said he and the team wanted to go in a different direction than how many ships are designed in modern games, avoiding the all-white aesthetics of real-world spaceships but also refraining from the organic shapes of alien craft in other science fiction titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The SyFy and Amazon series The Expanse (adapted from the book series by James S.A. Corey) was a huge inspiration, with vessels like the Rocinante, the Donnager, and the Razorback looming in Robinson's mind. The ships are bulky and loaded with details meant to evoke "functionality," inviting the player to imagine how they might be used in real life.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-simplifies-social-media-linking-after-aggressive-api-updates" target="_self">Steam simplifies social media linking after aggressive API updates</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But The Expanse is just a tertiary inspiration. Robinson and the game's 3D artist are trained architects who graduated from the same school. "[Architecture] teaches you to always think within the human scale," he said. "So if you look really closely, our spaceships have doors, handrails... I was designing the art style that was like 'this is an object that people use.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said his education emphasized minimalism, on "form following function."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edgeflow's geographic isolation from the rest of the game development world raises interesting implications. In regions with more populous game development communities, developers regularly interact with each other and learn at overlapping institutions. They're often inspired by similar games (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and have to fight hard to create distinctive elements when competing in a space like say, deckbuilder-based roguelikes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But because Robinson and his team weren't so embedded in the same culture, they had a chance to enter the genre with fresh eyes—but also without the same foundational resources.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/windows-on-arm-is-not-ready-for-the-complexities-of-the-pc-gaming-landscape" target="_self">Windows on Arm is not ready for the complexities of the PC gaming landscape</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The lead developer of ">The lead developer of <span>Breachway</span> hadn't played <span>Slay the Spire</span> before starting development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Plenty of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sprung to life after the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The deckbuilding roguelike format is a great foundation for all kinds of games, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Train</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Griftlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inscryption</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all being shining, standout examples.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amusingly enough, Robinson said he hadn't heard of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> until he was well into developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Remember, the game started off as a 1v1 card game, and it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FTL</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that was the team's greater inspiration when they pivoted to single-player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe that's partly why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't approach deckbuilding the same way </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does. "We never saw </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as a deckbuilder, but rather a game with turn-based deckbuilder combat," he said. "If you want to make a deckbuilder, then you're automatically boxing yourself in to the standards of the genre. You have one resource type, you play the cards...they go on cooldown, etc."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> requires players to juggle three resource types, themed around attack, defense, and cargo energy (red, green, and blue). Cards are drawn and discarded, but they also have fixed cooldown periods that create different timing windows than milling a deck through the discard pile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The size of the player's deck was a particular sticking point for Robinson—one that led to the unique cooldown mechanic. "In most deckbuilders, having a thin deck is very powerful, so we had to come up with something to solve that issue. Instead of having cards go into a draw pile, each card has a cooldown period."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can have thin decks (they can go as low as five cards, as of this writing), but encouraging players to make their decks as small as possible doesn't feel as good in a spaceship combat game. "With spaceship games, you want to add a lot of cool weapons, and then you get more powerful. In a card game, you want to have as few cards as possible. Those two things clash with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fans of The Expanse can think of it this way: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game where players can build ships as lean as the Razorback or as chunky as a beefed-up Rocinante.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scuttling in sideways to the roguelike deckbuilder genre means Edgeflow has a slight...well, edge, on the competition, but it came at something of a cost. Romania is not a country with a large game development community, and as mentioned before, it's the only game studio in Timișoara.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So to learn how to make the game they wanted, the team had to lean on YouTube tutorials, game development forums, and GDC talks. Recruiting was also something of a challenge, since Timișoara is a city with a thriving software community, largely focused on information technology. A small independent team can't match the salaries of a company like local software firm Berg Software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Edgeflow pulled it off (with help from publisher Hooded Horse), and is now helping build out a small local community. But it can be difficult to talk about game design, Robinson said, because developers don't have the same "vocabulary." The internet helps (Robinson praised Tim Caine's YouTube channel as a great resource) but it's hard to kick imposter syndrome to the curb when you're learning all of game design from scratch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breachway</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a great accomplishment for a small team representing a growing region. Edgeflow's lateral maneuver into a popular genre is a strong case study for developers who want to make similar kinds of games.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review</a></h2>
<p>Now could be a good time to get into Final Fantasy XIV, as in our Dawntrail review, Miguel said, <em>“Although it admittedly doesn’t quite hit the heights of Shadowbringers, Dawntrail’s shift in narrative focus injects a vibrancy into Final Fantasy XIV with this more lighthearted romp, while still keeping track of a greater story. With an increase in challenge of the instances, a couple of excellent new Jobs, an introduction of new characters, and the development of existing ones, Dawntrail clearly shows there’s life after averting the end of the world and I – for one – wouldn’t change a damn thing.”</em></p>
