		<p>The Xbox Showcase has kicked off with a brand new game, Doom: The Dark Ages. The title explains all you need to know about the game, it’s Doom but medieval.</p>
<p>The big news is this a Bethesda game – so owned by Microsoft – but it is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox GamePass, Xbox Series X|S, PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you really need to know more, here’s a little from Bethesda:</p>
<p><em>Wage war as one man matched against Hell’s legions in a dark fantasy setting expanding the DOOM universe. Witness the origin of the Slayer’s rage and his rise from a kingdom’s last hope to Hell’s greatest fear in this pulse-pounding, cinematic prequel to DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal.</em></p>

<p>Go medieval on battalions of demons, made up of all-new threats as well as familiar foes reforged from DOOM’s classic bestiary. Bring their malicious forces to heel with heavy duty shooter combat in a heroic story of epic proportion, powered by the latest idTech engine.</p>
<p>Blast, bludgeon, bisect and break through the enemy ranks using the Slayer’s superhuman strength, lethal arsenal and unmet tenacity. Supplement your trusty Super Shotgun with The Dark Ages’ new weaponry, including the face-shattering Flail and revved-up, throwable Shield Saw.</p>
<p>Inspired by the original DOOM (19 93), players overcome the odds in The Dark Ages in firmly grounded, heavy-hitting clashes featuring destructible demons, vicious melee strikes and more. With the right combination of ranged bombardment &amp; melee aggression, anyone stepping into the Slayer’s boots will make Hell quiver in theirs.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ cosmic-scale conflict calls for the heaviest ordnance possible, and the Slayer heeds. Enter the cockpit of your Atlan – a daunting skyscraper-sized mech capable of toppling Hell’s behemoths with titanic metal fists – and reclaim the skies aboard the Slayer’s Mecha Dragon, strapped to the jaws with jet engines and overwhelming firepower.</p>

            <p>
Konami provided a fresh look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater at tonight's Xbox Games Showcase.
</p>
<p>
After snippets at previous showcases, this new trailer showed off plenty of gameplay of the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake.
</p>
<p>
However, there's still no release date. Take a look at the trailer below.

<p>

Dialogue is taken directly from the original and fans will recognise plenty of areas, cutscenes and set pieces, all with vastly improved graphics.
</p>
<p>
The sunny haze of the original is out and sharpened textures are in.
</p>
<p>
Plus, a first look at The Boss!

            <p>
Developer Undead Labs' State of Decay 3 - the reportedly troubled latest entry in its zombie survival series - has resurfaced after four years, courtesy of a moody cinematic trailer.
</p>
<p>
State of Decay 3 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-announced">initially announced</a> during Microsoft's 2020 Xbox showcase. Two years later, with the game still nowhere to be seen, reports began circulating alleging <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-report-details-troubled-development">sexism and mismanagement</a> at Undead Labs, with staff claiming the game had been announced too early, and at a time the studio "didn't even know what it was".
</p>
<p>
Now, however, State of Decay 3 has resurfaced, appropriately enough, during Microsoft's latest Xbox Games Showcase, albeit with not a second of gameplay in sight. Instead, Undead Labs has opted to reintroduce State of Decay 3 with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjL3a5ZOFNo">atmospheric cinematic trailer</a> focusing on the plight of some of the characters central to its story.
</p>

<p>
To accompany the trailer, studio head Philip Holt <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/">took to Xbox Wire</a> to tease some of the ideas driving State of Decay 3's development. "The first thing that I hope people pick up [from the trailer] is that there's four player characters we're highlighting," he explained, "three of them start in different places in the world — so we’re implying this idea of a shared world experience, not just a ride-along, and that the boundaries in which you can go off independently are going to be much, much greater than they were in State of Decay 2."
</p>
<p>
Undead Labs has apparently had help from Obsidian Entertainment, Gears studio The Coalition, Blind Squirrel Entertainment, and Wushu Studios to get State of Decay 3 to this point, and the goal is to create an experience featuring a heavy emphasis on more reactive co-op combat, more visceral zombie dismemberment, and more realistic enemy reactions, among other things.
</p>
<p>
That's not a lot to go on admittedly, and there's still no word on an arrival date, but when State of Decay 3 eventually shows up it will - like all Microsoft first-party titles - be a day one Game Pass release.

            <p>
Starfield is getting an update this evening as Bethesda shows off a first look at expansion Shattered Space.
</p>
<p>
As part of today's Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and Bethesda showed a trailer for the expansion, which is taking on a distinct space horror vibe.
</p>
<p>
There's still no release date though, it's simply slated for 2024.
</p>

<p>

It begins, as all good space horrors do, with a distress call of unknown origin. And something doesn't seem right.
</p>
<p>
The trailer features plenty of ghostly apparitions plus mentions of House Maroon and the great serpent. It feels a little Prey, too.
</p>
<p>
As for the update, it arrives tonight adding new gear, new bounties, and new custom content from Bethesda and various community content creators. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-out-in-autumn-city-map-stuff-due-soon">expansion's release was confirmed back in April</a>, though the lack of specific date will be frustrating for fans.

            <p>
Kicking off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">this evening's Xbox showcase</a>, we got a look at Doom: The Dark Ages, and oh my days, it looks awesome.
</p>
<p>
"Before he became a hero," the video begins, "he was the super weapon of gods and kings." And what a super weapon he was. But, don't let me tell you. You can check out Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal trailer for yourself below.

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages will serve as a prequel to 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal. It is described as a single-player action FPS that "tells the epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage", and of course, it is being developed by id Software.
</p>
<p>"You are the Doom Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages will be coming to Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam) and PS5. On its debut, it will be available day one on Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
We don't have a specific release date as yet, but the studio confirmed it will launch in 2025.

In the gameplay trailer we got a first look at Joanna Dark in a near-future Cairo setting. “Team <em>Perfect Dark</em> has pulled inspiration from elements of the first two games, but crafted an entirely new story and universe around them for this reboot,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-details-interview-xbox-games-showcase-2024/">says Xbox wire editor in chief Joe Skrebels</a>.</p><p><em>Perfect Dark</em> is the usual first-person secret agent shooter, and it will be a single-player experience with a set amount of missions. There will be choices in how you complete the missions, and there are gadgets available in the game as you’d expect. In the trailer there’s a tease of a gadget that analyzes NPC voices and creates deepfake ones to let you create distractions or bypass security systems.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t provided a release date or window for <em>Perfect Dark</em> yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft have published the very first trailer for EA and BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, formerly known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, at their summer Xbox Game Showcase. It accompanies the first details of this "immersive single player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" - pause for ecstatic applause from Anthem haters - "where you become the leader others believe in". Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

I was expecting a game in which you gather "a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories", but I wasn't expecting the presentation to be this, well, heisty. The trailer begins with old dwarf chum Varric taking part in a pub brawl and launches into a montage of the game's other characters which reminds me more of Ocean's Eleven than Dragon Age. Others in the trailer comments are comparing it to Fortnite, and on reflection, it does look a bit like a trailer for an emotes and costumes rollout. The final piece of the puzzle is, needless to say, your anonymous custom character, who ends the footage by dropping a chandelier on a bunch of hoodlums. 
</p>
<p>
I'm... cautious about this, but I also like that I've been caught off (Veil)guard. The fourth Dragon Age has been in the works for a while, amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-lays-off-around-50-employees-as-work-on-mass-effect-and-dragon-age-dreadwolf-continues">difficult times for BioWare</a>, so it needs to be something more than another straight-laced high fantasy offering. Still, I hope it's a bit more traditional in-game. I do not play Dragon Age for High Jinks and getaway music.
</p>
<p>
The characters are Harding, the Scout, Neve, the Detective, Emmrich, the Necromancer, Taash, the Dragon Hunter, Davrin, the Warden, Bellara, the Veil Jumper and Lucanis, the Mage Killer. All very "one last job". The plot pitches you up against corrupt gods who have escaped their centuries-old prison, demons and, of course, dragons. I guess I'm allowed to say that I'm seeing Dragon Age shortly - if you have questions, please fill the comments with them.

            <p>We've known for a while that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a> was getting its first expansion later this year, but tonight's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/xbox-game-showcase">Xbox Games Showcase</a> gave us its first trailer. My main takeaway? That Bethesda are leaning into cosmic horror, as the trailer features landscapes that look like they're on the other side of an Oblivion gate than anything I saw during my time with Starfield.

<p>"A mysterious power stirs in the city of Dazra on House Va'Ruun's hidden homeworld," says the blurb on the <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/shattered-space">Starfield site</a>. "Investigate a frightening cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and gear in this all-new adventure." 
</p>
<p>I think there's probably an inverse relationship between how interesting a piece of DLC is, and how quickly a description of it mentions new "gear". 
</p>
<p>The same reveal during the show also included mention of a new update for the base game, which releases later today. It includes a new questline, and a bundle of new items made by the Starfield creator community. It's not the update I was hoping for - the one that would finally add new vehicles to Starfield - but that one is still due to arrive sometime later this year.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> is the next Bethesda Doom game, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2016">DOOM 2016</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom: Eternal</a>. It takes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> series back to a more civilised medieval age, where men and demon solved their disputes with throwable chainsaw shields, massive dragons, and guns that grind skulls at silly speeds then fire out the bone chips.

<p>“Before he became a hero, he was the super weapon of Gods and Kings,” exclaims the trailer. While the world we're shown here looks like a different age for Doom, its certainly not lacking in technological advancement, with giant mechs that the Slayer can pilot for a light spot of demon stomping. There’s also some more decisively medieval melee combat options, like a chained mace. Also, the Slayer has a furry cape, which looks ridiculous with his space marine helmet.</p>
<p>The last shot we’re shown in the trailer is the Slayer flying over a huge city on the back of some kind of plasma wyvern.  Aerial vehicle combat in my DOOM? If I didn’t trust the team implicitly, I’d be worried.</p>
<p>There is, of course, one notable absence from the trailer, that being the music of Mick Gordon, following his departure from the series a few back after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-allege-doom-eternal-composer-mick-gordons-statement-was-one-sided-and-unjust">allegations of serious piss-taking</a> on Bethesda’s part. Still, it’s an exciting reveal, although any good will toward Xbox’s future line up is worth tempering with the reminder that they recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered the studios</a> that made Prey, Redfall and Hi-Fi Rush.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will release this October, including a day one launch on Game Pass, with an open beta on the way - and it’s certainly looking like a Call of Duty game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The shooter opened Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase tonight with a gameplay reveal trailer, interspersing live-action clips of Presidents Bush and Clinton with planes dropping bombs, burning oil wells, helicopters, exploding vehicles and lots of bullets whizzing about. The typically subtle reveal was backed by The Prodigy’s Firestarter</p>
<p>The trailer also confirmed that Black Ops 6 takes place in the nineties after the end of the Cold War. As well as the very Call of Duty-looking gunfights, there were some snippets of what looked to be more James Bond-esque espionage levels, with talk of a compromised agency, traitors, conspiracies, hidden truths and some kind of biohazard threat.</p>
<p>As well as the campaign, there’ll be the returning multiplayer - with a dozen six-on-six maps, plus four four smaller Strike maps - and Zombies modes, with the latter having two maps at launch.</p>

<p>In a clear dig at Call of Duty’s more recent console home on PlayStation, Xbox’s Phil Spencer highlighted that the showcase appearance was the first on-stage Xbox showing for a Call of Duty game in a decade, before confirming that the game’s upcoming beta, season expansions and updates will land simultaneously across all platforms.</p>
<p>Spencer went on to drop the tidbit that Call of Duty currently has over 100 million players - colour me personally surprised at the size of that sustained audience, honestly, even with Warzone taken into account - before reconfirming, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-announce-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-launch-alongside-teaser-trailer">as we already knew</a>, that Black Ops 6 will arrive in Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>That Day One will specifically be October 25th of this year, with an open beta arriving sometime before that. We’ll no doubt find out more shortly during the game’s own dedicated Direct after the Xbox showcase.</p>

<p>The official reveal trailer, which was shown during the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, provides the first look at the game's seven companions, who will all have some rather unique backstories.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>When corrupt gods break free from centuries of darkness, the odds will be stacked against you. You can't do this alone.</em></p>
<p><em>Rally a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend, and even fall in love with. Among them, an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective will each bring their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone; decide who to take into battle and together face down demons, dragons, and even ancient gods.</em></p>
<p><em>You'll fight alongside:</em></p>
<p><em>Harding: The Scout</em><br>
<em>Neve: The Detective</em><br>
<em>Emmrich: The Necromancer</em><br>
<em>Taash: The Dragon Hunter</em><br>
<em>Davrin: The Warden</em><br>
<em>Bellara: The Veil Jumper</em><br>
<em>Lucanis: The Mage Killer</em></p>
<p><em>Create memories with your team which will deepen your experiences and give you more to fight for. The world teeters on a knife's edge, but together you have the power to fight back.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, the Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't be the only look at the upcoming RPG by BioWare we're getting this week, as in two days, more than 15 minutes of gameplay will be shared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/state-of-decay-3-emerges-with-a-new-trailer-at-the-xbox-games-showcase.895518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24174830/state-of-decay-3-xbox-games-showcase-2024-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RGacrX"><em>State of Decay 3</em> was first revealed in 2020, with a brief teaser trailer showing a survivor hunting an infected animal in a winter environment. The game went back underground after that, and Undead Labs focused on regular updates and experimental patches for <em>State of Decay 2</em>. At Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase, we got to see a new trailer for <em>State of Decay 3</em>, and it shows a much larger look at the various heroes and zombies we’ll encounter.</p>
<p id="G7AASx">The State of Decay franchise is zombie survival games where the player has to build up a base, manage resources, secure fortifications, and reach out to other groups. Much of the gameplay in <em>State of Decay 2</em> is procedurally generated; the survivors who join your settlement arrive with their own past, pet peeves, and complications. It’s up to the player to roll with the punches and survive regardless — although that usually requires some of the player’s existing characters to perish dramatically.</p>
<p id="AjzTI1">It looks like the <em>State of Decay 3</em> trailer has leaned into this angle heavily, showing a heroic sacrifice and a shrine made up of curious trinkets and keepsakes left behind. The trailer also showed a healthy amount of combat, with survivors warding off the undead through the power of firearms and teamwork.</p>
<p id="GquLLO">There’s still no release date for <em>State of Decay 3</em>, but after a barebones teaser trailer and then years of silence, it’s good to see the project re-emerge. </p>

  <p id="XCdY0K">At Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase, BioWare premiered a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23151929/dragon-age-dread-wolf-title-bioware-da4-dreadwolf"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a> (formerly <em>Dreadwolf</em>), featuring something that fans of the storied role-playing game franchise have awaited for a decade: a release window. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will officially launch sometime this fall, on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p id="H1JXvh">The new trailer for the fourth mainline Dragon Age game was more of a tone-setter, introducing players to the adventurers they’ll fight alongside in <em>The Veilguard</em>. Those allies include:</p>
<ul>
<li id="rbmsfA">Harding: The Scout</li>
<li id="0Lhgep">Neve: The Detective</li>
<li id="FN5DVQ">Emmrich: The Necromancer</li>
<li id="MpnH1R">Taash: The Dragon Hunter</li>
<li id="dTWZFo">Davrin: The Warden</li>
<li id="5CGukb">Bellara: The Veil Jumper</li>
<li id="2gk6KY">Lucanis: The Mage Killer</li>
</ul>
<p id="HapKsb">BioWare promises those seven companions will have rich lives and deep backstories, and that you can befriend them, and even fall in love with them, over the course of the single-player narrative. Expect to learn more about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s companions and how they’ll play during a gameplay reveal livestream on June 11.</p>

<p id="a94Rli">Little has been revealed about the follow-up to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/12/31/7474647/polygons-games-of-the-year-2014-1-dragon-age-inquisition">Polygon’s 2014 game of the year</a> up to this point, other than that it will be set in several nations previously unexplored in a core Dragon Age game, and that it will continue the story of Solas, a rogue mage and companion character from <em>Inquisition</em> who inspired the legendary figure of the Dread Wolf and wants to tear reality apart. </p>
<p id="2lIZuy">However, BioWare shared in blog post last week, those behind the game felt like naming the game after the Dread Wolf felt a little off. “Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions — not your enemies — are the heart of this new experience.” </p>
<p id="hwb4zd"><em>Dragon Age</em> games are known for their rich companion characters, and <em>The Veilguard</em> boasts a collection of seven, with “deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives.” </p>
<p id="p2TCLv">It’s been a long and rocky road for <em>The Veilguard</em>, especially of late, with layoffs at BioWare, including all members of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23903782/dragon-age-dreadwolf-qa-workers-laid-off-keywords-studios">Canada’s first games industry union</a> in 2023, former employees <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23903033/bioware-severance-lawsuit-canada-dragon-age-dreadwolf">suing for inadequate severance</a>, and in general a high level of turnover among veteran Dragon Age staff and writers, including creative director Mike Laidlaw in 2017, producer Mark Darrah in 2020 (though he later returned as a consultant), and writer Mary Kirby in 2023. </p>
<p id="SN37aq">Only time will tell if <em>The Veilguard</em> can once again reach the heights of its predecessors. But now we know when that time is.</p>

  <p id="Ba30bE">Bethesda has finally revealed the launch date for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23852522/starfield-review-xbox-series-x-pc-exclusive-bethesda-microsoft"><em>Starfield’s</em></a><em> Shattered Space</em> DLC at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23937256">Summer Game Fest</a>. The inaugural piece of DLC for Bethesda’s latest open-world RPG, to be released in 2024, will introduce a new quest line centered around a mysterious Great Serpant in addition to a robust helping of new ship parts, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. <em>Shattered Space </em>was announced prior to <em>Starfield’s</em> launch, and was sold as part of the $99.99 Premium Edition of the game players purchased around nine months ago.</p>
<p id="dh93mL">The team announced new changes heading to the game on Sunday that will introduce new locations, gear, and bounties to the game. <em>Starfield</em> has enjoyed a myriad of changes and improvements from its dedicated modding community, but this DLC represents the most substantial official changes to <em>Starfield</em> since its launch back in September. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24146378/starfield-improved-maps-difficulty-options">Bethesda’s post-launch support</a> for the game has been limited to a handful of updates, which have largely focused on addressing bugs and performance issues.</p>
<p id="4ji8YZ">While a new storyline is always a welcome addition, personally, I’m more excited about the new customization options <em>Shattered Space</em> is promising, so I can build even crazier ships and settlements.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since fans have seen or heard anything about Fable from Microsoft, but the Xbox Summer Games Showcase 2024 decided to drop some new information about the upcoming reboot. It was also confirmed that the game is coming 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer gives a new look at the game’s hero as well as some gameplay.</p>







<p>“What does it mean to be a Hero? Humphry, once one of the greatest, will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence,” the new trailer’s description reads.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The reboot of Fable was first announced back in 2020. However, over the last four years, news had been few and far between. With this latest bit of information, though, fans could expect to see more news on the game come more frequently as the game’s 2025 release approaches.</p>

<p>As a daily player of Diablo 4, I’m beyond excited to get my hands on the upcoming expansion, Vessel of Hatred. Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long, as the official release date is October 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The full intro cinematic for the expansion offered a lot of unique story details.</p>

<p>Perfect Dark was just revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, with Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative unveiling the next iteration of this first-person shooter stunningly. It looks flawless at first blush, and it’s set to emerge a quarter of a century after the first game debuted way back in 2000. In the new trailer, we get a glimpse at the world of Perfect Dark and the intense capabilities of Agent Dark, the iconic protagonist.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perfect-showcase">Perfect Showcase</h2>



<p>In 2020, The Initiative revealed that it was working on a reboot for Perfect Dark, but until now, not much has been shown. In the background, the team at The Initiative and the squad at Crystal Dynamics have been <strong>cooking</strong>, producing a title that looks equal parts impressive and innovative.</p>



<p>Here’s the first trailer for Perfect Dark:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Perfect Dark - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Incredibly, the first Perfect Dark trailer reveals <strong>gameplay </strong>alongside CGI visuals, which is remarkable for a first-pass trailer. With fluid movement mechanics, multi-faceted combat sequences, and a stealth-laden campaign, Perfect Dark looks… Well, <strong>perfect</strong>.</p>

<p>The Steam’s description reads, “From the creators of Contrast and We Happy Few, South of Midnight is a spellbinding third-person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South.

<p>The Xbox Games Showcase is throwing out hit after hit with the announcement and reveal trailers, but one took me by surprise. Expedition 33, an upcoming RPG by developer Sandfall Interactive, shows promise. Here’s what we know so far!</p>



<hr>



<p>First and foremost, the reveal trailer for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 displays a world of mystery and magic, with otherworldly beings seemingly controlling the fate of an entire population. But the player, as part of Expedition 33, will fight back against this looming threat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDyqGZy78Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The gameplay, especially the combat, appears most similar to JRPGs. It’s action-packed yet relies on a turn-based system, with each character wielding unique weapons and abilities against various enemies.</p>



<p>We don’t have a release date just yet, but there is a release window for Expedition 33 in 2025!</p>

<p>Fallout 76 is getting a major update on June 12, and it’ll be bringing the first base map expansion to the game. Over the last couple of years, Bethesda Game Studios has crafted out-of-map ‘expeditions’, but this latest update will introduce Skyline Valley, the first new major region to be added to the Appalachian map since the game was released in 2018.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-life">Back to Life</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 was pretty abysmal at launch, but thanks to the dedication of Bethesda Game Studios and the ongoing support of a community of millions, the game has been turned around into something quite respectable.</p>



<p>Here’s the latest trailer that showcases Skyline Valley:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Skyline Valley will be added to the south of the existing map, bringing about a range of points of interest, new factions and NPCs to meet and greet, and a ‘cataclysmic’ weather system that promises to terrorise players to no end.</p>

                <p>The next game from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games will arrive in 2025. Additionally, Microsoft reiterated that South of Midnight will come on day one to Game Pass while also showing off the first gameplay trailer for the title at the Xbox Showcase.</p><p>The roughly four-minute video--seen below--begins with South of Midnight's protagonist Hazel riding on a talking catfish. She's apparently looking for her mother, who has gone missing after a Category 5 hurricane, according to an additional post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/south-of-midnight-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. Their search is interrupted, though, when they come across a giant gator named Two-Toed Tom.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4UHyaaWXuw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This leads Hazel into jumping off the catfish to go ring a church bell to distract the enormous albino alligator. From here, we see that South of Midnight is played from a third-person perspective as an action-adventure game. Hazel apparently has magical powers, with a spirit-like grapple hook.</p><p>Hazel also comes across an enemy called a Haint. She uses close-quarters combat and magic--called Weaving powers--to take on this nasty dark-energy creature. Hazel can quickly dodge attacks and is seen getting behind the foe to slash it up with what appears like magical daggers. After defeating the Haint, the area blossoms with flowers.</p><p>The South of Midnight gameplay trailer also displays three different Weaving powers in the top of the left-hand screen for Hazel. They are called Weave, Push, and Pull. The trio of abilities will be needed not just for combat, but exploration and puzzles, as well.</p><p>South of Midnight is being described as a wide-linear experience with chapters. The action-adventure game is coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and the cloud.</p>

The game was fully unveiled during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9, and we are very excited to return to Thedas.</p><p dir="ltr">Electronic Arts dropped a new story trailer for the game during the showcase, running through some of the companion characters you'll meet during the game and giving a little sense of what they're like and how they'll help you smash through enemies on your journey. The trailer gives a quick look at seven of them: Harding, the Scout; Neve, the Detective; Emmrich, the Necromancer; Taash, the Dragon Hunter; Davrin, the Wardin; Bellara, the Veil Jumper; and Lucanis, the Mage Killer. The trailer also ends with a huge dragon dropping into a massive battle, towering over the proceedings. It's pretty neat.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the trailer for yourself below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drVOCrvXHhE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/drVOCrvXHhE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We also got another important tidbit of information: Dragon Age: The Veilguard will launch in Fall 2024 for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the first new Dragon Age game since Dragon Age: Inquisition from 2014, which received numerous game-of-the-year honors at the time. Since its launch, developer BioWare has struggled with new projects, releasing Mass Effect: Andromeda to a mixed reception, followed by Anthem, which was a critical and commercial flop.</p>
