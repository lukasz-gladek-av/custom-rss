            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>

Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." Not exactly descriptive!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has come under fire for this, either. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">exact scenario played out back in February</a>, when Activision admitted that it had used generative AI in the development of Black Ops 6, including in a zombie Santa loading screen that angry fans referred to as "AI slop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">just this past August</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie clarified the team's stance on the technology further:</p><blockquote>“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools. I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</blockquote><blockquote>"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</blockquote><blockquote>“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, IGN asked why the zombie Santa and other generative AI images hadn't been removed from the game yet, to which Leslie said that was not his department, and that "the team is actively looking at that stuff." It is unclear if, why, or how Activision's stance on this has changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is out now. We've given the campaign a try and aren't totally crazy about it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">with our reviewer saying</a> it's " a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In a brief shot, we saw Mario and Luigi riding motorcycles across the desert in the outfits they're wearing above, before shooting off a sand dune and revealing the same Inverted Pyramid in a valley below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, that just seemed like one piece of a larger montage of areas the brothers might visit during their adventures across the galaxy. Dedicating an entire poster to it prompts questions as to whether or not The Super Mario Galaxy Movie might significantly feature components of Super Mario Odyssey's story. Will we see more kingdoms? Perhaps Cappy?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, both The Super Mario Bros. Movie and what we know of this new sequel do play fast and loose with what Mario games they borrow from. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was full of references and didn't really follow the loose plot (such as they are) of any game in particular, and we already know The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will feature Bowser Jr. as a prominent villain, complete with his Super Mario Sunshine paintbrush. We even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-spotted-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">suspect he's using Wonder abilities from Super Mario Bros.

                <p>Earlier this week, Embark Studios debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-arc-raiders-north-line-update-full-details/1100-6536145/" data-ref-id="1100-6536145">North Line</a>. It includes a new map called Stella Montis, which was locked behind a community event that had to be finished first. However, Arc Raiders players didn't waste any time and unlocked Stella Montis in under 38 hours.</p><p>To reach Stella Montis--a map located in the "cold pristine" part of the Rust Belt, players had to donate a sizable amount of resources to tunnel through to that location. On <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a>, Embark noted that it raised the requirements to enter Stella Montis because players were being more generous with resources than the studio anticipated. Despite that, players still powered through the goal.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - Stella Montis | New Map Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now that Stella Montis is open for exploration, players can visit the map and start earning XP there. The map's description calls the ruins in the map "eerily pristine," as well as "cold, sterile, and steeped in mystery." There are ARC enemies to battle there, and two new types have joined the game: The Matriarch and the Shredder.</p><p>In addition to the Stella Montis quests, players can get a new energy burst battle rifle, as well as a trio of quick-use items: an impulse mine, a timed mine, and a gas jump mine. The game is also introducing two new playstyles, Lone Wolf and Trailblazer.</p><p>Last weekend, Arc Raiders set a new benchmark for itself with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">462,488 concurrent players on Steam</a>.

But it morphed over time to become XDefiant, according to a new report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg story about AdHoc Studio</a>, the developers of workplace superhero comedy game Dispatch, which describes their journey from Telltale Games to Ubisoft to their own independent studio. The leadership of AdHoc began working together at Telltale Games, working on Tales from the Borderlands, before Nick Herma, Dennis Lenart, and Pierre Shorette departed for Ubisoft in 2017. There, the trio worked on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told Bloomberg. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, they explain that Ubisoft was beginning to push games as a service hard across its portfolio, and Splinter Cell didn't quite fit that mould. Over time, the Splinter Cell project transformed into what would become xDefiant, a free-to-play first-person shooter that launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review">middling reviews</a> last year and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">shut down just this past June, taking two entire studios with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trio eventually reunited with Michael Choung, another former colleague from Telltale, to start AdHoc Studio in 2018. While working on a version of what would eventually become Dispatch, they also took on a scriptwriting co-dev gig on The Wolf Among Us 2, only to pull out of the project after writing an 800-page script due to frustrations with a lack of creative control. That project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/telltale-games-has-allegedly-laid-off-most-of-its-workers">last we heard of it</a>, seemed similarly ill-fated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, though, the group was able to pull together the final version of Dispatch with the support of both a publisher and a number of well-known actors thanks to casting director Linda Lamontagne. A last-minute deal with Critical Role for another game helped get them across the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Splinter Cell, fans remain bereft of a new game, with the last new Splinter Cell title being Blacklist from way, way back in 2013. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-very-early-look-at-splinter-cell-remake">allegedly a remake of the original 2002 game in the works</a>, but Ubisoft has been so quiet about it since 2022 that it's hard to say whether or not it will ever fully emerge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, meanwhile, is excellent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> was supposed to be a bold new foundation for <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future</a>. Instead, it was the beginning of the decade-old sci-fi shooter’s most disappointing stretch yet. Back in September, Bungie promised a roadmap laying out the vision for the live-service MMO in the year ahead. Two months later, the plans are still in flux. Bungie now says it won’t be ready to reveal what <em>Destiny 2</em> looks like moving forward until early 2026. In the meantime, it’s scrambling to engineer a 180 with its upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>expansion.</p> <p>“As we continue to act on your feedback, we’re taking additional time to craft our long-term strategy for the future of <em>Destiny</em> before we share a full State of the Game and multi-year roadmap next year,” the studio revealed this week. It treated fans to what it’s called a new “Content Calendar” instead. No big ideas. No major overhauls. But it did preview everything fans can expect from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-star-wars-renegades-lightsaber-x-wing-ash-iron-2000624489">December 2 <em>Renegades</em> expansion</a> and its first significant update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Destiny 2: Renegades Content Calendar has been published.</p> <p>We need more time for the roadmap, plain and simple. Expect a true Roadmap, and State of the Game, next year.</p> <p>Again, many apologies. <a href="https://t.co/fw9R49MriX">https://t.co/fw9R49MriX</a> <a href="https://t.co/eKkSURkpjE">pic.twitter.com/eKkSURkpjE</a></p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1989091556884889623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The big takeaways? All players will be able to hit the new Power cap just by playing <em>Renegades</em> activities, vault capacity will go up to 1,000 slots to accommodate all the new loot, and all Exotic Armor ornaments can now be swapped between gear of the same class and slot, giving a big boost to <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s fashion meta. The seasonal Dawning, Iron Banner, and Call to Arms events will also be returning. Any lapsed players probably have no idea what to make of Bungie saying stuff like “Vanguard Alerts will bring back some Nightfall vibes,” but long story short: <em>Renegades</em> should hopefully cut a lot of the grindy bullshit <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">fans faced in <em>Edge of Fate</em> back in July</a>.</p>

 <p>Here’s Bungie’s brief postmortem on what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s least played, most panned expansion since launch:</p> <blockquote><p>With <em>Edge of Fate,</em> we presented a different vision for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards.</p> <p>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for <em>Destiny</em>.</p> <p>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing though throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of <em>Destiny</em>’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.</p></blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097">Bungie has taken</a> all of the negative feedback to heart. I imagine this has probably been one of the toughest stretches, purely in terms of morale, in the game’s post-launch life. But it remains to be seen if the studio can still engineer a way out of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s 2025 nosedive. The challenge, as ever, is in how you make doing the same stuff over and over again still feel fresh more than a decade later. Maybe you can’t. Or maybe<em> Destiny 2</em> just needs a humble back-to-basics reboot, at least for its progression and weekly grind. I’m still rooting for it.</p>

                <p>The Unexpected Initiative quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> sends you to the Buried City map in search of Fertilizer and a Water Pump. You'll need to visit two separate--though thankfully close by--locations to interact with and loot these items, so you may be here wanting to know precisely where. You're in luck because we're going to fill you in.</p><p>Note that the game will provide both Fertilizer and a Water Pump to you as part of this quest, but you can also find these in other places and turn them in from your own stash if you prefer. However, since the quest has to be done in a single Buried City raid to count, you do still have to visit both locations and loot them to check off the objectives either way. Either way, it's a good idea to bring in an augment with two safe pockets so that you keep both the Fertilizer and Water Pump you find, even if you don't manage to extract safely.</p><p>Let's dive into where to find the Fertilizer and Water Pump for the Unexpected Initiatives quest.</p><h2>Where to find Fertilizer at the Grandioso Apartments</h2><p>The Grandioso Apartments are located on the western side of the Buried City map. This is a large residential POI that is commonly visited by other raiders for its above-average loot. Keep an eye out for suspicious folks and be ready for a fight if absolutely necessary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602689" data-ratio="0.56276686592656" data-width="2342" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602689"></a><figcaption>Grandioso Apartments location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive, take the inner zipline up to the top floor, then take the nearby stairs up to the roof.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602712"></a><figcaption>Fertilizer location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg"></figure><p>Here, you'll find Fertilizer in some orange planting pots. Toss it in a safe pocket, then head to the Piazza Roma region for the next step.</p><h2>Where to find a Water Pump at the broken rooftop gardens at Piazza Roma</h2><p>Piazza Roma is just northeast of the Grandioso Apartments, making it only a short trek there after grabbing the Fertilizer. There are multiple buildings in this area, but you're headed for the building circled in the photo below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Concord</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam/"><u>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Firewalk Studios' Overwatch-like shooter</u></a>, was live for just two weeks before it was pulled offline. Though <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/448419/concord-gameplay-final-hours-close-servers-offline-time-date/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Concord</em> certainly had <em>some</em> dedicated players</u></a>, it didn't have many—which is why it may be surprising to hear that a group of players are reverse-engineering the game and its servers to bring it back to life.</p><p>Publisher Sony removed <em>Concord </em>from stores and digital marketplaces, automatically refunded some, and, later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shut down Firewalk Studios</u></a>. Two hundred or so people were laid off, and any hopes of <em>Concord</em>'s return were dashed. Poor sales—<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing?ref=aftermath.site"><u>estimated to be under 25,000 copies sold</u></a>—and low player numbers marred the release. Firewalk Studios' <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>game director Ryan Ellis said</u></a> in a blog post that pieces of the game "resonated with players," but "other aspects of the game and [<em>Concord</em>'s] initial launch didn't land the way [<em>Firewalk Studios</em>] intended."</p><p><em>Concord</em> wasn't a bad game, but it just didn't generate enough interest with enough players. Now, a group of three hobbyist reverse-engineers, who go by real, Red, and gwog online, are trying to make it playable again. They explained the process to Aftermath in an interview over Discord.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just like the virtual equivalent of taking things apart and putting them together," gwog said.</p><p>The group got a build of <em>Concord</em> running this week and posted a video of the match on YouTube. Red, who led a project to bring <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c42pwg/lawbreakers_is_playable_again_unofficially/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>LawBreakers</em> back online</u></a>, said it was the first time he'd played <em>Concord</em>. When Red heard the game had died, he sought it out.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make some explosive plays with Roka's Blast Dive! 💥 <a href="https://t.co/BD7gxAPBhC?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/BD7gxAPBhC</a></p>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1826650547312619635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>"I pretty much always do this when games die," he said. "There's also part of it that is due to the technical challenge that <em>Concord </em>brings with it, it's probably the most complex project I've worked on so far, and that really motivated me to keep going."</p><p>Red said there are two ways to reverse engineer a game like this and have it run on a server. He used a method that turned the game into its own server. Red said most games and game servers share code.</p><p>"Sometimes there's enough of the server left in the game, that we can 'activate' that code and make the game believe it's a server," Red said. "We do pretty much always need to fill in the gaps though, that involves a 'trying to find a needle in a haystack' approach of just trying to find something that doesn't exist, and recreating it. This is typically the most challenging part of these projects."</p><p><em>Concord</em> used an anti-tamper software to keep people from cheating, which also creates a problem for people reverse engineering. It's "nearly impossible" to crack, Red said, so the group didn't—they found an exploit to "forcefully decrypt the game's code" to "restore the game and start working on servers." Red said he started working on reverse engineering <em>Concord</em> as soon as the game went down, but the team was stuck for a long time on the anti-tamper software. Most of the progress, he said, took place over the past two months.</p><p>Real, who had never worked on a reverse engineering project before but recreated the backend API, said this work "feels like building something without the instructions."</p><p>"Sometimes you have a picture of what it's supposed to be," he said. "Sometimes you only have the pieces. You slowly (or sometimes if you get lucky, quickly) build it up until it looks exactly like (or close enough to) the metaphorical picture of what it's supposed to be. I worked on a lot of the backend server elements, think of them like save data. It contains stuff like what items you have unlocked, what level you are and how much XP you have."</p><p>Friday morning, a video of the playtest was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordGame/comments/1owxnp4/concord_is_now_running_on_custom_servers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>posted to the <em>Concord</em> Reddit page</u></a>. The Discord channel, where people can learn more about future private playtests has grown quickly; hundreds of people have joined for a chance to play <em>Concord</em> again. It's not open to the public, but people can sign up for future tests. Even former Firewalk Studios employees have joined the server. They're excited to see <em>Concord</em> come back to life, too, the developers said.&nbsp;</p><p>Red, who is passionate about game preservation <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and the Stop Killing Games movement</u></a>, said the next step is adding <em>Concord</em> to a platform he created to host dead games, <a href="https://ancify.io/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">called Ancify</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's intended to serve as a platform for dead games so that several games can share authentication, matchmaking, server deployment, and other such infrastructure to prevent us from having to put in duplicate work for each project," he said. <em>Radical Heights</em>, <em>Hyenas</em>, and <em>LawBreakers</em> are all on there now, in different states of functionality. There's no exact timeline for the addition of <em>Concord</em> but Red said to expect it “soon.”.</p><p>"I think a big part of [reverse engineering] is just being curious and motivated," Real said. "I'm very interested in '<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc/"><u>lost media</u></a>' and the like so I initially gravitated towards <em>Concord</em> because of the very large wave it made online as well as its incredibly short lifespan. Over the course of the project I began to respect a lot of the design choices I initially questioned and I think that also motivated me to keep working on it. I think part of it is wanting other people to see what I saw."</p><p>And for the people questioning why <em>Concord</em>, Red had a message.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just hope people can be respectful about this. Regardless of whether someone likes the game or not, there'll always be people liking a specific game, and you never know, the game you like might be the one dying next."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-guide-how-to-get-your-custom-loadout">Battlefield REDSEC Guide - How to Get Your Custom Loadout</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After two years, the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> lawsuit between Ravensburger and Upper Deck is coming to a close. Yet, after winning its cases, Ravensburger is pushing Upper Deck to pay the legal fees for its defense.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/11/08/ravensburger-pushes-for-upper-deck-to-pay-3-8m-legal-fees-it-racked-up-defeating-groundless-but-unrelenting-disney-lorcana-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, a US federal judge ruled in favor of Ravensburger in all of Upper Deck's claims against the company. Those claims included copyright infringement, fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, and unfair competition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-lawsuit-rush-of-ikorr-box-promo.jpg?itok=OfcN_kMN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-lawsuit-rush-of-ikorr-box-promo.jpg?itok=ROfxGsOm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The lawsuit began in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ravensburger-sued-by-upper-deck-over-disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summer of 2023</a>. Basically, Upper Deck sued&nbsp; <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana's</em></a> lead designer, Ryan Miller, and Ravensburger for allegedly stealing and repackaging one of their in-development card games, <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, into the popular Disney-themed TCG. These alleged copyright damages, according to Upper Deck's legal expert, were worth around $240 million.</p>

<p>Upper Deck argued that Miller was working for Upper Deck at the time, spending a year working on <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, and that Disney Lorcana had "remarkable, uncanny similarities" to that game..</p>

<p>In fact, Ravensburger stated that Upper Deck should pay Ravensburger's legal fees for wasting their time with the Disney Lorcana lawsuit, requesting $3.8 billion in legal fees. The claim states,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A complete defence verdict on an objectively meritless case warrants a full fee award.&nbsp;Upper Deck’s case was frivolous in conception, objectively unreasonable in prosecution and pursued in a manner that multiplied costs while consuming vast judicial resources."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, Upper Deck alleged copyright infringement on 43 separate game elements in Disney Lorcana. One of these mechanics included "taking alternate turns." The defense of these claims involved the exchange of 7,000 documents, and extended quizzing on all witnesses present for those 43 potentially infringing elements.</p>

<p>Given the fact that gameplay mechanics cannot be copyrighted, plus the extended procedures involved, Ravensburger's statements of this case being meritless does hold significance.</p>

<p>Upper Deck is continuing their legal fight against Ravensburger, filing an additional lawsuit in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-publishing-guide-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-releases-xbox-publishing-guide-online-for-free.1354309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has dropped its Xbox Games Publishing Guide for everyone to see. The guide, which was strictly under NDAs and such, is now fully available, coincidentally around the Steam Machine’s reveal.</p>







<p>For many indie developers, Steam has been a beacon for those who want to publish their first title. Via SteamDirect, one can, realistically, make a game, submit it, and it’ll be on the gaming platform in a little over a month. However, for other companies like PlayStation and Nintendo, it can be a bit more trickier to do. However, one company that has been a bit hard to tackle for indies is Microsoft. Despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox program</a>, many games are just not releasing on the consoles, with many citing the difficult process. Now, in the advent of the Steam Machine, Microsoft has decided to pull back the curtain and make the once-hidden guide available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-makes-xbox-games-publishing-guide-available-for-everyone">Microsoft Makes Xbox Games Publishing Guide Available for Everyone</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/11/unlocking-access-to-game-publishing-documentation-for-all-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Game Dev Blog</a>, Senior Program Manager at ID@Xbox, Ed Stewart, announced that <strong>the official Xbox Games Publishing Guide</strong> is <strong>available for free</strong> to everyone. The guide can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/game-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> for those interested. Speaking on the opening, Stewart said the following,</p>



<p>“<strong>By opening our Game Publishing Documentation, we’re removing barriers to learning and making it easier for teams of all sizes to understand what it takes to ship a game on Xbox</strong>,” Ed Stewart says in the blog. “<strong>Whether you’re a first-time independent developer or a seasoned publisher, you can now browse the guide freely, share it with your team, and reference it throughout development.</strong>“</p>



<p>The move does take a page right out of Steam’s playbook, which couldn’t be more convenient. The PC-only company recently announced it’s taking on the console market with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Its console will be able to play Steam games from your PC onto the TV. Microsoft is aware of it, as Xbox’s Phil Spencer congratulated the team. Perhaps this is the company wanting to become Steam or like them. Seeing as it’s putting exclusives like Halo and Gears of War on different consoles, it could be the future for Xbox.</p>







<p>What do you think of Microsoft releasing its Xbox Games Publishing Guide? Do you think more indies will make it onto Xbox? Think Microsoft wants to be Steam? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/821250/switch-2-update-third-party-dock-update-blocked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-recent-switch-2-update-blocks-some-third-party-docks-but-nintendo-isn%E2%80%99t-saying-why.1354300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently issued an update (21.0.0) for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2 console</a> that, in addition to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">some small changes</a>, has caused some third-party docks to stop working as intended. In the early weeks and months of the console’s availability this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">companies raced</a> to figure out the right commands, the right power draw, and the right chips to use in order to trick the Switch 2 into thinking it had connected to the real thing — Nintendo’s dock, which is included with every console. Now, some of them will have to figure out how to do it again.</p><p>You’re not alone if you think Nintendo did this on purpose. But did it? According to Nintendo, not exactly. Gaming site <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081"><em>Kotaku</em></a> published a new statement from the company that says it “does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility.” Read in one way, it seems like Nintendo didn’t intend to cause these issues with its latest update. Read another way, Nintendo has apparently established that there’s a legal and an illegal way to create a third-party Switch 2 dock, and a lot of the ones out there were made illegally, apparently.</p><p>The fact that some third-party Switch 2 docks still work makes this more confusing. I tried out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Viture’s Pro mobile dock</a> (one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware">early third-party docks to provide Switch 2 support</a>), for use with its Pro XR glasses, and it just works fine with the same firmware that’s been on it since I started testing it months ago. Antank’s rep Susie also tells us its S3 Max still works “because it uses a proprietary casting chip solution” whose “compatibility with Nintendo’s private protocol is higher than other third-party solutions on the market.”</p><p>Without more details from Nintendo, it’s tough to know what this spells for the future. Are more docks on the dock chopping block? Is it reconfiguring its proprietary Switch 2 dock handshake to leave third-party dock makers in a constant scramble? Will it develop (or has it already developed) something similar to the Apple MFi certification program to let companies pay a fee to promise support out of the box with its locked-down port?</p><p>Whatever the answers are, Nintendo will naturally want to push consumers towards using its pricey dock, and push third-party companies away from trying to engineer duplicative gadgets at a fraction of the cost. That spells an interesting next couple of months for third-party makers, including the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price">Genki</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/801096/you-can-leave-your-switch-2s-dock-at-home-with-this-40-charger">JSAUX</a>, which are both launching compact, power adapter-size docks later this year. Switch 2 support is on each of their feature lists, but we’ll see if it remains a selling point closer to their launches.</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 14th</strong>: Added Antank’s comment.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/821250/switch-2-update-third-party-dock-update-blocked]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is dense. That happens to be part of why I love it so much. But there’s no way around it: There’s a lot of stuff to keep track of in this game, from craftable materials, to weapon mods, to the weapons themselves, not to mention quick use items and your augments and shields. It feels endless sometimes–especially given that we so often interface with them one item at a time while we pick ‘em outta random bins or lockers we’ve broken into, or scavenge them from the innards of mechanical menaces we’ve shot down (or biological ones).</p> <p>That’s where cheat sheets and other resources come in. <i>Arc Raiders</i> has been out for a couple of weeks and already there are a bunch of fantastic user-made tools out there.</p> <p>Whether your preference is for images, spreadsheets, or websites, I’ve tracked down a few impressive and wildly useful resources to help you break down the game. Some of these address very specific parts of the sandbox of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ toys, while others are more comprehensive. Let’s take a look.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders </i>Database: The GOAT</h2> <p>Let’s kick things off with what I think is currently the best third-party resource for looking up info and tracking your progress as you collect your way to supremacy. Enter <a href="https://ardb.tools/"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Database</a>. Ardb.tools really is a one-stop shop for details on just about any item, map, and even enemy you’d need information about. Looking for a specific resource? Each item gets its own page, complete with all the info you need including locations on each map where you might be likely to find it. You can also directly compare the stats of guns and their various upgrade tiers. It rocks.</p>

 <p>There’s not much else I can say about it other than to encourage you to head on over and start clicking around. The tricky thing with these websites is that they’re only as good as their information is relevant, and as a live-service game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a moving target for these kinds of projects. But for now at least,</p>

 <p>this is perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough third-party resource for <i>Arc Raiders</i> thus far, and I also think its UI is very well done. Bookmark it; let it live on a second screen, or use it on your smartphone.</p> <h2>A more comprehensive weapon breakdown</h2> <p>As I said in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">my weapons overview</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is a tricky game to figure out metas for. There are so many ways to enter and leave a match, and so many ways to get into or out of trouble, that simple DPS or TTK stats only give you one part of the picture of an <i>Arc Raiders</i> gun battle.</p>

 <p>But if you want a deep dive, all the way down to headshot multipliers and how many shots it takes to kill someone, have a gander at <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/4c1e78b900b3bf5d/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9253d3f8-679e-4b41-90be-f4f0e67f74f8%7D&amp;action=default&amp;redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0VmalRVNUtlWjBGTGtMNzA4T1pfZFBnQmtXbXRMNW52dS1NLUZvdllUdTRIWFE_ZT1zeVR6WGU&amp;slrid=f660d9a1-f07e-0000-17be-eeccdf68937c&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy80YzFlNzhiOTAwYjNiZjVkL0lRRDQwMU9Tbm1kQlM1Qy05UERtZjNUNEFaRnByUy1aNzd2alBoYUwyRTd1QjEwP3J0aW1lPWNQemV1YlVqM2tn&amp;CID=e5a5ee82-eb40-4380-a467-656d8059d225&amp;_SRM=0:G:39">the Anvil Community’s Weapon Metrics spreadsheet</a>.</p> <p>As an .xlsx, you can even download the <a href="http://spreadsheet.it/">spreadsheet</a>. Clearly, it will work better in Excel or Microsoft’s live office tools. I’ve been able to download it and add it to my Google Drive, and it seems to work alright. The tabs on the bottom of the page refer to shield strength, so it will recalculate TTKs based on what your target is potentially wearing.</p>

 <p>This information might be wildly subject to change given <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ live-service nature, but for now, it’s one of the only ways to drill down to specifics such as headshot multiplayers and specific numbers of shots-to-kill.</p> <h2>Just the crafting resources</h2> <p>Two resources stood out to me when considering a cheat sheet focused entirely on resources (in addition to the excellent PDF/PNG cheat sheet I shouted out in <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">my inventory management guide</a>).</p>

 <p>First up is the humbly named “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">Scrap” Google spreadsheet</a>, created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1owy9dm/scrap_spreadsheet/">by Redditor s1munsayz</a>. This is a very simple spreadsheet laying out all of the crafting resources you can recover, with a simple layout of what they can be recycled/salvaged into. Resources like ARDB are amazing, but a straightforward spreadsheet is sometimes a better visual learning aid.</p> <p>Be sure to make your own copy in your Google Drive to use its search functions appropriately.</p> <p>I also want to shout out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1otpx0o/inventory_manager_manage_your_inventory_easier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Redditor Legal_Squash_195’s</a> “Inventory Manager,” a standalone Python app you can <a href="https://github.com/dev-boog/Arc-Raiders-Inventory-Manager">download from Github</a>. You’ll need to have Python installed on your machine to get it to work, but it’s a handy app–and if you’re like me and enjoy a good standalone, community-created piece of software, Inventory Manager is pretty awesome.</p>

 <h2>Honorable mention: arcraiders.wiki</h2> <p>While I think ARDB takes the cake with its vast amount of options, <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/">arcraiders.wiki</a> was an early resource for me and it remains a solid way to sort through and look up the nature of various crafting materials, weapons, enemies, and maps.</p> <hr> <p>Time will tell how useful these resources remain over time, especially as <i>Arc Raiders</i> continues to get updates and potential changes to its meta math under the hood. For now, bookmark, download, do whatever you need to, because having these resources at the ready dramatically improves the overall flow of a healthy session of <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p>

                <p>I've been an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arknights-endfield/" data-ref-id="5000-560807">Arknights: Endfield</a> fan since the first global technical test in January 2024. Its art style that blended anime with realism and similarities with RPGs I enjoyed like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-genshin-impact/2900-6419/" data-ref-id="2900-6419">Genshin Impact</a> convinced me to try it. In the process, I found an intriguing world with a layered combat system and building mechanics that set it apart from competitors. Now, with the game's latest build, developer Hypergryph has reforged and polished those systems to feel even snappier and more accessible than what I remember.</p><p>According to developer Hypergryph, the team has redone 80 to 90% of the cutscenes and dialogue, about 50% or so of the structure of the maps, and nearly 40 to 50% of the game's overall level design--a lot of the game I first played back in 2024 is just not there anymore. But, after previewing Arknights: Endfield again for over five hours ahead of the official beta's launch, I have no doubt I'd spend another 20 in this brave new world.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arknights: Endfield Technical Test Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>When I first booted up this new version of Arknights: Endfield, I was quickly reintroduced to the controls with an action-packed battlefield. The player character, the Endministrator (or just Endmin), harnesses the power of a resource called Originium, which they can use to attack during combat and create and repair Originium-based machines. Later, we learn that the Endmin was the leader of Endfield Industries and the creator behind many of the machines that they control. Perlica, the poster character for Arknights: Endfield, and Chen Qianyu, a counterpart of Ch'en (a popular operator from the original Arknights), come from the same faction.</p><p>The intro didn't have the kind of impact I hoped for with a frantic but mindless boss battle and heavy exposition that slowed down the pacing with multiple time skips that detailed what happened leading into Endfield's story. However, after the first 20 minutes or so, the story starts to pick up when Perlica joins the Endmin on their first mission.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602341" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602341"></a><figcaption>You play as the Endministrator, the amnesiac leader of Endfield Industries.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602341-endmin-header.jpg"></figure><p>Arknights: Endfield is an open-world action RPG with building mechanics that encourage you to essentially build your own mining and transportation infrastructure. Combat-wise, you can deploy up to four characters at once and even fight alongside them on the field, but you can only control one character at a time. Each character has skills that you can use so long as you have skill points, which you charge up as you fight with actions like dealing damage and dodging. You can also take advantage of combo skills, which you can manually trigger with a button while using another character so long as the conditions are met.</p><p>During the first mission, a prompt to activate Perlica's combo skill appeared after the Endministrator temporarily stunned an enemy. While I could have timed skills one after the other in the original test to increase damage, being able to stack an attack on top of the other with a combo skill added an additional strategic layer to the combat system I already enjoyed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602332" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602332"></a><figcaption>Left to right: Andre, Chen Qianyu, Endministrator, Perlica.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602332-endfield-characters.jpg"></figure><h2>Making combat snappier than before</h2><p>Ryan, one of the co-founders of HyperGryph and lead designer on the original Arknights title, explained to me via a translator the changes his team made for the second beta like this shift in combat. As the lead designer on Arknights: Endfield, he mainly handles systems design and oversees all things design-related, including characters and environments.</p><p>"This [change to combat] is done mainly because we received feedback that certain players believe our combat may not be as smooth as they have wanted," Ryan told me. "Basic attacks, for example, may easily get interrupted and [break] their combos. So we've added dodge, and we've also made changes to basic combat. So right now, players should have a much smoother combat flow and combos."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602336"></a><figcaption>When an Assist Skill is available, your teammate's icon will pop up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602336-assist-pop-up.jpg"></figure><p>Dodging works similarly to how it would in most action games, where pressing a button at just the right time evades damage. In Endfield, successful dodges also charge your skill point meter so that your characters can more frequently cast stronger attacks.</p><p>Dodging isn't the only way to charge your skill meter--landing basic attacks and stringing together combos can too. Before, the closest I could get to dodging was using the dash button to quickly move out of the way of an attack. A true dodge mechanic makes evading enemy attacks much smoother and erases some of the frustrations I had with combat back in 2024. The incentive to play more skillfully so that you can charge your skill meter is also a plus.</p><p>Combo skills also help recharge your skill points, but they are trickier to set up. Each character has a combo skill that depends on a specific trigger, and you may have to build your team around these triggers to maximize synergy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602343" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="2872" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602343"></a><figcaption>The dodge mechanic was one of the major upgrades from Beta Test I.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602343-dodge-mechanic.jpg"></figure><h2>An easier to understand factory system</h2><p>Ryan also led the revamp of Arknights: Endfield's signature factory system. I started playing with factory mechanics within the first 90 minutes or so of the preview, where I recovered an open field to use for the AIC--aka your main "power plant" hub. From here, I relearned how to set up machines to automatically convert ores into higher-quality materials for building. Arknights: Endfield incentivizes you to use this factory system to streamline farming, build convenient transportation points between your most visited areas, and even sell products later on.</p><p>Arknights: Endfield easily reminds me of existing gacha RPGs with its combat menu and character progression systems, but it's the only one within the genre that I could think of with the ability to craft and place structures across the map with some kind of utility behind them. While the AIC is confined to one area, you can build towers and ziplines across the map depending on where you want to direct power for your machines or build ziplines for easy transport. I built a machine to automatically harvest ores, a machine to transform stacks of ore into materials for new towers, and so on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602337" data-ratio="0.56260899895361" data-width="2867" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602337"></a><figcaption>The factory system includes many machines and power supply.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602337-factory-system.jpg"></figure><p>You might also need to use the factory system to solve environmental puzzles, which appealed to the problem solver in me. I found abandoned machines that needed a power source to be operated, for example, so I built relay towers between them and the AIC. Once the machines were powered, I could use them to open gates that had treasure locked behind them.</p><p>This latest beta holds your hand when it introduces the factory system with a tutorial that details explicit instructions throughout the process, which I appreciated when I needed to learn how to build again. Arknights: Endfield also now has a blueprint system that lets you copy others' factory system layouts, so that you don't need to build them yourself if you don't want to or can't figure out how to. Between the more detailed tutorial and new blueprint feature, the factory system is a lot more approachable than it was before.</p><p>"Some players feel that the factory system is a very daunting task, so they don't know how to get started with [it]," Ryan explained. "At the same time, some core players who are more familiar with the factory system feel that they need more space and playgrounds to try out more complex designs. Based on these above considerations, we thought of the blueprint [system] as a great solution, which can take care of the two issues that we mentioned earlier."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602338" data-ratio="0.56236933797909" data-width="2870" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602338"></a><figcaption>You can build ziplines almost anywhere you want.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602338-zipline.jpg"></figure><h2>Sci-fi is more complicated than you think</h2><p>I asked Ryan what he thought was an important but underrated aspect of a game like Endfield that he didn't think players would notice right away. In response, he brought up Arknights: Endfield's concept designs in sci-fi.</p><p>"So, from a player's perspective, they may not find a lot of distinguishing differences [between genres]. But, in reality, when making a game, I think sci-fi concepts are a lot harder to make than fantasy ones. In terms of game designs, sci-fi is a bigger challenge because, from structural designs to designs of monsters and all sorts of in-game elements, having a sci-fi theme means all these designs have to have a certain sense of logic in them. They have to have a certain sense of reasonability in them compared to other concepts, and that means we have to put a lot of considerations into our concept designs. Maybe some players may not be able to see this or feel this immediately upon playing the game, but we believe having these elements and considerations in our game design will help us to produce more original work."</p><p>For those not familiar with the series, Arknights: Endfield takes place in the same universe as the Arknights tower defense mobile game in a future far, far away. Its futuristic setting features chrome-laden environments filled with buildings, machines, and structures (like shelters, farming plots, etc.) that imply the existence of a technologically and scientifically advanced society.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602024" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602024"></a><figcaption>Outside of Wuling City, the new map in Beta Test II.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4602024-wulingscreenshot2.jpg"></figure><p>Arknights: Endfield kicks off in a region called Valley IV, which looks like a tech center hit by an apocalypse. Machinery in these areas are rugged, but aspects of their design still point toward each of their original purpose--maybe mining or irrigation. In my last 90 or so minutes with Endfield, I also explored Wuling City, which was significantly redone between this test and the last. This area features tall buildings and bustling streets like a city, but also includes water-themed structures that match the environment around it.</p><p>Ryan estimates it would normally take between 20 to 30 hours to enter the Wuling area if you focused on story content, so don't expect to see it as soon as I did. Wuling City also draws inspiration from many of the Hypergryph devs' alma mater, the China Academy of Arts.</p><p>"Rather than duplicating a certain building per se, the entire map draws some inspiration from the China Academy of Arts. That may include structural references, but also certain designs are actually done by professors within the China Academy of Arts," Ryan said.</p><p>"I think you will find details and pieces all over the map that draws inspiration here and there, especially in [the city part of] Wuling City."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601988" data-ratio="0.56216216216216" data-width="740" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601988"></a><figcaption>Wuling City is inspired by the China Academy of Arts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4601988-wulingscreenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2>It's never too late for this gacha</h2><p>Last but not least: the gacha. Arknights: Endfield is a free-to-play gacha RPG, just like Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. It features limited-time banners with an increased drop rate for the featured character and both 5-star and 6-star characters.</p><p>Unfortunately, the gacha system wasn't available for testing during the preview. So I asked Ryan what we should expect to see when that system goes online. He wasn't able to tell me the exact numbers for the pity system (the maximum number of times a player would need to exchange currency on the banner), but he did reveal that Arknights: Endfield doesn't simply copy paste the same system from games like Genshin Impact.</p><p>Usually, limited-time banners feature a character that you can only get for six or so weeks. When the banner ends, you need to wait for the character to come back during a rerun. Instead of only running characters for a limited time, Arknights: Endfield characters featured in limited-time banners will still be available indefinitely after their debut. However, the increased drop rate for a featured character will still only be available during the limited-time banner. They will essentially just become another character you can get on the standard banner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602342" data-ratio="0.56228253305498" data-width="2874" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602342"></a><figcaption>Perlica and Chen are your first two free-to-play characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4602342-perlica-chen-qianyu.jpg"></figure><p>"So, simply put, there will be two main pools for players to use: the basic one, and more of a time-limited one. But we have done changes so that characters that get their probabilities up in the limited pool, they're not going to disappear after the time of the event. They're still going to be there for a while for some players to catch up," he explained.</p><p>So far, Ryan has confirmed Perlica, Chen, and Wulfgard as the three free-to-play characters you can expect to see at this point in development. These three were a big help to me in the first beta, and the reworked kits for Perlica and Chen that I tried out were even more fluid than last time.</p><p>If you want to try the game for yourself, you can sign up for the second beta now from the <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arknights: Endfield official website</a>. Arknights: Endfield Beta II Test officially begins on November 28, 2025.</p><p>Arknights: Endfield is slated to release in early 2026 for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>

Activision gave GameSpot a very brief teaser of Season 1 content coming to Black Ops 7's campaign endgame. This includes a limited-time mode for Endgame, and while we don't have any major details, we can say some very massive fights will be taking place across the campaign's Avalon map.</p><p dir="ltr">We weren't able to capture the footage being shared with us, but the video showed players fighting a giant robot across Avalon in Black Ops 7's endgame. Activision also told us that players can get inside the robot, so it seems this is something you can hijack and take control of for your own use.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The zombie T-Rex featured as the boss fight in Black Ops 6's Shattered Veil map will also become a boss encounter on Avalon. The strategy for fighting this version of the T-Rex boss looks similar to doing so in Zombies mode, with players launching themselves onto its back to deal major melee damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only saw a glimpse of the Season 1 campaign content, but it definitely gives players something to look forward to in Endgame. Black Ops 7's endgame is playable by either completing the campaign to unlock it, or teaming up with another player who already has access to the mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/football-manager-2026-is-the-series">The Game Business</a> once again reveals the latest GSD sales data, and which games made the top-10 on Europe's sales charts for last week (November 2-9). While previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-back-in-top-spot-eu-sales-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-drops-to-third/">weeks have been dominated by Battlefield 6</a>, last week's sales tell a different story, with Football Manager 26 roaring into the top spot to knock Battlefield off, at least for a week.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled</a>, it was even more critical for SEGA and Sports Interactive that Football Manager 26 was a success, and so far, at least commercially, that's been the case. According to The Game Business, not only is this a big release for the Football Manager series, it's the biggest launch in the history of GSD releasing these weekly sales charts, a practice it started back in 2017.</p>



<p>That said, for all its commercial success, Football Manager 26 has not gone over well with players, with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/">player reviews categorized as 'Mostly Negative' on the game's Steam page</a>. Still, those negative reviews today won't change the fact that, at least for a week, Football Manager 26 sits at the top of the EU's sales charts in both units sold and revenue.</p>



<p>Despite being toppled, Battlefield 6 did not fall too far down the list, remaining in the top three at the number two spot for both revenue and units sold. It's followed by EA Sports FC 26, which has also been one of the leading titles in recent weeks, followed by Pokémon Legends Z-A and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment in fourth and fifth place, respectively, on the units sold chart. On the revenue chart, they swap places, with Pokémon in fifth place and Hyrule Warriors in fourth.</p>



<p>Other notable entries in the top-10 lists include Ghost of Yotei, which came in at the eighth spot for units sold and the sixth spot for revenue, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which made the units sold list in ninth place and the revenue list in seventh. </p>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei continues to ride the wave of its first month and a half on the market, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 re-enters the charts <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">thanks to a mixture of a free trial weekend where players on Steam and Xbox could try the game for free</a>, and get the game at a discounted price with all of their progress made in the free trial carrying over. The free weekend and discount were also timed with the release of the game's third and final DLC expansion, which drew even more players back to it after it launched at the start of this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-10 games in the EU for units sold for last week (November 2-9):</p>



<ol>
<li>Football Manager 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a packed week in the gaming industry, and if you’re trying to catch up on the gaming news you may have missed, Insider Gaming’s got everything covered. Battlefield 6 led the way with major updates on new post-launch modes and fixes for REDSEC and weapon bloom coming next week. Ubisoft, meanwhile, caused confusion after halting share trading and delaying its earnings report just minutes before release, all while quietly working on a new multiplayer shooter behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, PlayStation signaled that the PlayStation 5 (PS5) is only halfway through its lifecycle, the United Football League (UFL) is exploring the potential of becoming an officially licensed football video game, and it was revealed that God of War developer Sony Santa Monica had a new IP canceled despite more than $25 million invested into the project.</p>



<p>Here’s your full Insider Gaming recap of the biggest stories you may have missed this week.</p>

All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new. The press release includes some basic information about each of the drops, titled respectively The Hunt, The Hunters, The Monsters, and The Monsters II, but no card images as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunt</strong> focuses on non-creature spells, themed around "the terrifying attacks that monsters across the Monster Hunter franchise can unleash." There is one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Blind Obedience: Malzeno from <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em></li><li>1x Snap: Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Village Rites: Magnamalo and Tobi-Kadachi from <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></li><li>1x Mizzium Mortars: Yian Garuga from <em>Monster Hunter Generations</em> and <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Tooth and Nail: Azure Rathalos and Seregios from <em>Monster Hunter 4</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunters</strong> is, as it sounds, about the hunters themselves, with each card depicting a different set of armor and weapons and having the human creature subtype. As before, there's one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Grand Abolisher: Tigrex Armor with Bone Scythes from Monster Hunter Generations and Monster Hunter Freedom 2</li><li>1x Archaeomancer: Velkhana Armor with Slinger and Winged Seraphyd Greatsword from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>1x Grim Haruspex: Nargacuga Armor with a Hidden Eye Light Bowgun from Monster Hunter P2G/MHFU</li><li>1x Imperial Recruiter: Rathalos Armor with Red Tigrex Claws; Brachydios Armor with Burning Knocker; Gore Malaga Armor and Royal Rose from Monster Hunter 4G</li><li>1x Champion of Lambholt: Astalos Armor with Verdant Lightning Shield from Monster Hunter Generations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Monsters </strong>and <strong>The Monsters II</strong> are similarly self-explanatory, including the following monsters as legendary creatures. These are two different sets, but the press release is unclear exactly how these nine creatures will be split between them. IGN has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment on this and just generally on the confusing nature of this press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nezahal, Primal Tide: Lagiacrus from Monster Hunter 3</li><li>Drakuseth, Maw of Flames: Rathalos from Monster Hunter Generations</li><li>Sarulf, Realm Eater: Zinogre from Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</li><li>Vaevictis Asmadi, the Dire: Nergigante from Monster Hunter World</li><li>Ziatora, the Incinerator: Fatalis from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Razaketh, the Foulblooded: The Gore Malaga from Monster Hunter 4</li><li>Amareth, the Lustrous: Velkhana from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Wasitora, Nekorus Queen: Nargacuga from Monster Hunter Portable 2nd Generation/Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</li><li>Kalamax, the Stormsire: Brachydios from Monster Hunter 3 Generations</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box - Magic: The Gathering</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for both Secret Lair and third-party Magic collabs in general, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">some incredible Secret Lair card drops</a> including Sonic, Final Fantasy, Deadpool, SpongeBob, The Office and more. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">We're currently eagerly awaiting</a> the release of the Avatar: The Last Airbender Universes Beyond set, following close on the heels of Marvel's Spider-Man. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2026">Next year is looking equally stacked</a>, with planned Universes Beyond sets featuring TMNT, The Hobbit, Marvel, and Star Trek.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="554a4ad31a9c9"><a title="Riffmaster review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/554a4ad31a9c9/riffmaster-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/pdp-riffmaster-guitar-xbox-a-fun-option-for-rock-band-fortnite-festival-and-beyond">PDP Riffmaster</a> was first released back in April 2024, and it's a wireless guitar controller that's reviewed well, even if it is a little on the pricey side at the £130/$150 mark.</p>
<p>We've already looked at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-x-gibson-guitar-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-great-quality-at-a-price">CRKD x Gibson Guitar Controller</a>, which costs slightly less and does a very nice job of handling... well, there aren't actually that many games to play with guitar controllers on Switch consoles just now, so you're gonna have to settle for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a> with this new one, basically.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that the Riffmaster is designed specifically for this use case (although, of course, defeating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> with a guitar <em>is</em> what you came for). It's PDP's first guitar peripheral since 2015, when they released a Fender Jaguar-styled model for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/rock_band">Rock Band</a>. You know, back when everybody's home was filled with plastic guitars for the post-pub ritual of 'being better than your mates at pretending you're able to play a guitar'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ovkyuj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Okay, there's far more to it than that; it's a skilful pursuit, is perfecting the trickiest of rhythm game tracks, and something that I personally spent a lot of time (a shameful amount of time) enjoying back in the days when I could still feel pleasure. So, after an initial release that didn't see Nintendo consoles included, here we have a dedicated Switch model and, I'm pleased to say, it makes a solid impression.</p>

<p>Admittedly, being offered a guitar peripheral to review for Switch wasn't really on my radar when this one showed up. I'd given up on my love of all things <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock">Guitar Hero</a>-related, and my collection of plastic instruments (you better believe I've had a lot of drum kits and guitars and DJ decks through my house) has long since departed to that great big <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/playing-the-cex-retro-lottery">CEX</a> in the sky. So, what's it like to re-involve oneself through the PDP Riffmaster?</p>
<p>Well, if it had more games specifically for it — if I could plug it in (you don't even need a dongle, you just sync 'n' stroke) and get wellied into a load of my favourite tunes — I'd be having a great time, I'm sure. However, Fortnite Festival isn't great in all honesty, and it can be a frustratingly menu-heavy experience for those who aren't regular Fortnite players.</p>
<p>However, I'm here to review the guitar, not Epic's money-vacuum, and the Riffmaster is a delightfully light (just 1.570 grams, apparently), quiet, and easy-to-use guitar controller that improves on that 2015 model I mentioned in meaningful ways. Its buttons are laid out in a better arrangement, it's got a dedicated screenshot button so you can take pictures of the Fortnite menus, and it cleverly makes it easier to avoid erroneous inputs as you rock out.</p>

<p>Its strut bar is completely silent, making for a great way to stealthily jam with a pair of headphones in place, and it also stores away easily thanks to a foldable neck that doesn't trade build quality for ease of use. Simply lift up the little switch on the back of the neck to either flip the neck up or down. It clicks satisfyingly into place and never feels like it's wobbling or otherwise insecure as you play. Thusly, we are straight away in brownie points territory, as having big plastic guitars around your gaff can get untidy, and I appreciate this is easy to tuck out of sight. Even the box is surprisingly small.</p>
<p>The head can be fully removed, too, if needed, but the rest of the model is one piece, and this adds to an overall feeling of quality in the build. There's no noticeable squeaking, or movement of parts as you play, the fret buttons that sit on the top and lower portions of the neck feel responsive, and it wasn't too long (even with the game's UI) before I was failing miserably at all of the tracks included in Fortnite Festival - which does seem to be loads. At least they got that bit right.</p>
<p>Now, my favourite part of all of this is that the strut bar is totally silent and doesn't do any infuriating clicking and/or clacking as it moves. I hate that. I have always found it very distracting over the music (on older guitars, you could even hear it when the sound was full blast), and I'm grateful that it's been removed.</p>
<p>This smoothness continues into the fret buttons, as they feel light, responsive, and easy to release. There's no clickiness or feedback of any other type to distract you as you move between notes. It feels like a high-end version of what I remember playing years ago. Which, at this price point, is what you'd expect!</p>

<p>Am I any better at playing the songs as a result? No. But it feels as though it's easier to move across the fret buttons quickly, so it's unlikely that's the guitar's fault. Oh, and the range, which is apparently 30 feet of low-latency goodness, has impressed me as I've walked out to the kitchen for a snack midway through Soundgarden's <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg">Black Hole Sun</a></strong> (space stuff makes me hungry) and it didn't lose connection.</p>
<p>In terms of the overall design, it's very similar to the PDP Fender, but here they've exaggerated the lower left side so it looks 70% more like it belongs to a guitarist in a sci-fi movie band. I like it. It looks good. However, it does create a little bit of an issue with the included strap, as the connection point is tucked in beside the resultant groove along the bottom, and the strap gets a little stuck in around the USB-C port. Not a biggie, but something to note.</p>
<p>It's a very shiny guitar, too, so you're mileage may vary if you hate fingerprints - really shows every last mark and smudge. You can take off the face plate if desired, so there's the possibility to customise it a little. You know, maybe add a little Nintendo Life logo, or what have you. Oh, and isn't it amazing to no longer need a ton of batteries for these things? This model lasts for around 30 hours on a full charge.</p>

<p>Overall, then, the PDP Riffmaster is a cracking bit of kit. It's got me missing proper sessions on dedicated games. The only real criticism I have is that the price is hard to justify on Switch given the lack of games. Fortnite Festival will do — and I'm sure you know what you're getting into if you're considering a purchase anyway — but damn, it'd sure be nice to try this thing out on some proper games and with some proper local co-op action on the go, because everything about it feels great.</p>
<p>If you're in the market for a guitar controller for your Switch or Switch 2, and the CRKD isn't quite your scene, beyond a slight niggle with the guitar's strap not quite agreeing with the body shape, everything else here is sick, streamlined, and easy to get jamming with. Now, bring on the rhythm game resurgence!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">AdHoc Studio's debut project, Dispatch,</a> has become one of 2025's late entries into the game of the year conversation based on the way it's been received online by players and critics alike. The studio, which was founded by former Telltale developers, has taken a long, winding journey <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077">to get to the point where Dispatch is out and has sold over 1 million copies</a>. A journey that, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo">according to a new report</a>, included a stint at Ubisoft San Francisco, and how a new Splinter Cell game was eventually crushed under Ubisoft executives pushing for a games-as-a-service (GaaS) money-making game, which would become XDefiant.</p>



<p>It's a bit of a wild story, which is why it's not surprising that the reveal comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, a reporter who has essentially made a career out of telling some of the video game industry's most wild stories across all of his articles and his three books.</p>







<p>Nick Herman, co-founder of AdHoc, confirmed that after he and some of his fellow former Telltale cohorts left Telltale Games in 2017, <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">which was just before the studio would close</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">though it was later revived</a>), they joined Ubisoft San Francisco. At the time, the studio was working on a new Splinter Cell game, and Herman was excited for the work he was doing each day.</p>



<p>"<em>I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while, and we thought we could tell a great story and do something the</em> <em>fans would love</em>," Herman said. Unfortunately, those feelings were eventually dashed, as the report explains that Ubisoft executives, who were (and probably still are) obsessed with getting a giant GaaS game in the company's portfolio, pressured development teams across the company to find a way to make their projects games-as-a-service games.</p>



<p>"<em>We tried</em>," Herman began. "<em>'Let's make a narrative GaaS game.' We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.</em>" Nothing was able to go the distance, however, and soon after, Herman understood that Ubisoft was not interested in making the kind of game he was interested in making.</p>



<p>"<em>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great. And then you realize that all the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games</em>."</p>



<p>Herman and the rest of his former Telltale team members, who joined Ubisoft in 2017, would leave to start AdHoc in 2018 when the opportunity came, but the project that they left would grow to become XDefiant. According to the report, Ubisoft San Francisco started to focus more on wanting to make something to challenge Call of Duty, which is essentially what XDefiant was trying to do with its approach to multiplayer FPS gameplay.</p>



<p>So while Herman and his colleagues would go on to start AdHoc and eventually make Dispatch, under the stewardship of the same executive class that killed what is likely just one of many attempts at a new Splinter Cell game that've been crushed over the years, Ubisoft San Francisco went on to make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">a free-to-play multiplayer game that was shut down a year after it came out</a>. Ubisoft San Francisco was also shut down as a result. A classic masterful gambit from Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Regarding new Splinter Cell games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">we know the team at Ubisoft Toronto is currently leading development on a remake of the first game</a>, but we've not had an update on that project for a while now.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-inspired-monster-hunter-feature-towns-guilds-raids/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a> undoubtedly raised numerous questions for both fans of the franchise and the genre. How will it work, exactly? The games were single player only, except for the kid-friendly spin-off LEGO Horizon Adventures. Thankfully, IGN was able to obtain some answers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Executive Producer Sunggu Lee</a>. To start, Lee admitted that the co-op hunting action featured in CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series was a heavy inspiration for Steel Frontiers:</p>



<p><em>Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon’s core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point. From the very beginning, combining Horizon’s rich world with the hunting-action genre just made sense. And when you add Horizon’s unique machine ecosystem, the part-breaking mechanics, and its deep storytelling, you get something that feels truly distinctive—an experience that’s uniquely Steel Frontiers.</em></p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers is going to be an MMORPG set in the world originally created by Guerrilla Games. As such, it's no big surprise that Lee mentions towns and guilds as key systems in the game:</p>



<p><em>In Horizon Steel Frontiers, towns and guilds are really the heart of the community. Towns act as central hubs where players gather, prepare for hunts, and naturally connect with others. Out in the field, you might team up spontaneously with players you meet, or join forces in planned, strategic co-op play to take down tougher machines. These moments — whether unexpected or carefully coordinated — help strengthen bonds between players. And of course, we support all the core social features you’d expect from an MMORPG, like friends lists, chat, and party systems, so players can communicate and collaborate seamlessly.</em></p>



<p>The Executive Producer also discussed the changes to the combat system. Whereas Guerrilla's single player games are notoriously centered on ranged combat, the gameplay footage already showed that this will be a lot more melee-focused, and players will have to decide when to dodge and when to attack the machines. As an MMORPG, the game will support small parties to mid-sized raids, because truly large-scale raids would be confusing with this type of combat.</p>



<p>Despite Guerrilla promising some competition between tribes in the announcement video, Sunggu Lee says that the core content's focus is on PvE elements. No comment was made regarding the possible inclusion of Aloy or other characters. On the other hand, Lee confirmed that the game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Decima Engine.</p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is targeting a late 2026/early 2027 launch window</a> on PC and mobile, although NCSOFT is hoping to get Guerrilla (and Sony) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to agree to port the game to PlayStation 5</a>, too. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov is Getting Easier For The First Time in a Decade]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-easier-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade.1354222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played Escape from Tarkov from a fresh, uninitiated perspective, you’ll know that it’s <strong>not </strong>a welcoming game. It’s one of the most challenging shooters ever developed, and fans of the spearhead extraction title love to lord it over other gamers when they become <strong>cracked </strong>at Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>As the game hits 1.0 tomorrow, Battlestate Games is planning something that will, for the first time in a decade, make Escape from Tarkov <strong>easier for new players to understand</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-a-tutorial">Escape from Tarkov is Getting a <em>Tutorial</em></h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been pretty rough for years. You buy it, create a basic character, and are thrown into the game to figure out for yourself how the core mechanics work. The first tasks put to you are simple, but you have zero guidance, no map markers, and little in the way of any indication of where to go.</p>



<p>The game’s core mechanics were never explained, tactics were never outlined, and functions like healing, inventory management, and weapon handling were left up to the player to discover and master.</p>



<p>That’s why it comes as a surprise to learn what Escape from Tarkov has planned for the 1.0 release, which is dropping tomorrow after more than a decade of development.</p>



<p>When new players enter the fight in Escape from Tarkov from tomorrow, they’ll be met <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with a <strong>tutorial</strong></a> designed to help them learn the ropes. But it doesn’t end there. Beyond the tutorial, Battlestate Games has outlined step-by-step progression guides, building on the scattering of guides it introduced over the last year or so.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has never had a strict tutorial, only ‘more basic’ starter missions that were designed to ease players into the brutal game world, but even they were often sticking points early on in every ‘reset’ (read: wipe).</p>







<p>The tutorial arrives with a non-linear story campaign and end-game content, a new map, new mechanics and weapons, improvements across the audio and graphics suite in the game, and <strong>more than 1,000 improvements </strong>across the board.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about Tarkov 1.0.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release.

Neither the original PlayStation release of Dragon Quest VII nor the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-fragments-of-the-forgotten-past">2016 3DS remake</a> featured voice acting, so I asked Reimagined lead scenario writer if this changed how the team approached redesigning the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it did.&nbsp;</p><p>"Knowing that it was going to have voice over certainly did change the approach of the way I wrote the narrative here," Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya offices in Tokyo, Japan. “The original release on PlayStation didn’t have any voiceovers, and it was written [out]. So certainly, the way we wrote the language of the dialogue [in Reimagined] needed to be changed to be more realistic and more modern for modern audiences.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She says colloquialism played a significant factor in writing Reimagined’s dialogue, because everything needs to sound natural for the various included voice-over options.</p><p>I hear first-hand one of these changes when I encounter eventual party member Sir Mervyn at the top of The Tallest Tower dungeon while playing the game. After I awaken him from a special stone to defeat the flying Chimaera surrounding the tower, he does just that before gracefully landing beside my party. It's here I hear his voice, and it sounds like that of a medieval knight – this isn't too shocking, considering how he looks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in Japanese, he talks like a feudal samurai, Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/who-is-takeshi-ichikawa-the-producer-of-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">who you can read more about here</a>, says. Another example of this colloquialist effect present in Reimagined comes from Bulgio, an extremely wealthy man who gives Hero the special stone that houses Sir Mervyn. In English, Bulgio mixes Italian words into his English, reflecting the multicultural inspiration present throughout the world of Reimagined. In Japanese, however, that's not the case – instead of mixing English and Italian, his dialogue instead reflects his character rather than a nationality.&nbsp;</p><p>"He's supposed to be this rich, arrogant guy, and that's reflected in the dialogue," Takagi says on the differences between the Japanese localization and the English version, noting her work is focused on the former while other teams handle the latter. "At least for the Japanese version, we didn't necessarily write dialogue in a way that you can tell what these specific cultural backgrounds are for each character, but we did write dialogue in a way that it's immediately understandable what kind of personality that character has."&nbsp;</p><p>Takagi adds, "The world of Dragon Quest VII, as you know, is comprised of many different islands, and obviously the dialects on each of those islands tends to differ, so it is a very important part of the story of Dragon Quest VII to ensure that the residents of those islands can reflect the uniqueness and individuality of each of those islands and the cultures they have."&nbsp;</p><p>We'll get to hear more of these new voices when Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.
