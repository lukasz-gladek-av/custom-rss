            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the immense success of Diablo IV and the upcoming Path of Exile 2, both of which heavily feature microtransactions, primarily in the form of cosmetic skins, the ARPG genre, while flourishing, is bogged down by loot boxes, pay-to-win mechanics and in-game stores. It’s left many fans of the genre worrying about upcoming titles, such as Titan Quest 2. According to developer Grimlore Games, we have nothing to worry about. Titan Quest 2 isn’t pay-to-win and features no loot boxes!</p>



<p>On the topic of loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the mythology-focused ARPG, developer Grimlore Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Titan Quest 2, we intend to take a bit of a different approach than with most projects before. We want to involve the community in a typical Steam Early Access manner. Our reasoning: we want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence.</p>



<p>When the first Titan Quest originally released in 2006, it was the alternative to Diablo 2 and not many others in the ARPG genre. In 2024, the situation looks a little different. Apart from the still ongoing Diablo franchise, there are numerous other contestants out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But with such stiff competition and a desire to earn back its investment, Grimlore Games certainly has its work cut out for it in developing, releasing, and improving upon Titan Quest 2 over time. As such, the team made the community four promises:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We do despise this with a passion. There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.</p>



<p>You can play the way you want to play the game. When we launch into early access in the winter of 2025, we will however not yet have online multiplayer (four-player co-op) implemented. This will be among the first two updates once we launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, chances are you probably played the original game back in the day. Well, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist its sequel on Steam right now</a>!</p>



<p>While it won’t be available at launch, Titan Quest 2 will feature co-op sometime after its Early Access release. You have plenty of time to find a co-op partner or two to grind levels with. You could even check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> for like-minded players!</p>



<hr>



<p>It took a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titan-quest-2-17-years-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggering 17 years for Titan Quest 2 to be announced</a>, but the iconic ARPG is finally within our grasp. You just have to wait until late 2025, sadly!</p>

As Cody and May, a couple with a rocky relationship who have been trapped in a fantasy world, players will have to work together to overcome unique challenges and possibly mend a broken partnership. The game has been a critical and commercial success story since it was first released a couple of years ago, and its director Josef Fares has recently been teasing that studio Hazelight is working on something new that'll be published by EA again.</p><p dir="ltr">On the opposite end of wholesome co-op platforming, Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy game where you'll guide a squad of Colonial Space Marines through a deadly Xenomorph outbreak. With all communication lost on the moon of Lethe, it's up to you to figure out what happened and survive the journey. You can customize the abilities, weapons, and talents of your Marines, and while the core gameplay can become repetitive, it's still an authentic dive into the galaxy of Aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Temtem is a neat spin on the catch-'em-all formula established by Pokemon. You'll get to explore the six islands of the Airborne Archipelago, encounter dozens of Temtem, and train them in your quest to become the very best, like no one ever was. The game also features MMO elements, and you can team up with other players if you're looking to trade Temtem or battle them in intense competitions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus Free Games for December 2024</h2><p><em>Available December 3 until January 6, 2025.</em></p><ul><li>Aliens: Dark Descent (PS5, PS4)</li><li>Temtem (PS5)</li><li>It Takes Two (PS5, PS4)</li></ul><p>As part of PlayStation's 30th Anniversary celebrations, Sony has also announced several events that'll be taking place in December.

Now, the game's developer has responded to the criticism… by posting a Beatles song.</p><p dir="ltr">"Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in Dayz?" Bohemia Interactive CEO Marek Spanel said on Twitter. "That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for 'just a map,' and some users demand 'gimme more for less money.' Hmm.

The game is currently sitting at a "Mostly Negative" user review score <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2968040/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, where players are pointing out the DLC's various flaws. The main problem seems to be a lack of new, engaging content.</p><p dir="ltr">"First things first: This is not even an original map," one user pointed out. "This $37 CAD DLC map is a cut-down reskin of the ArmA III map 'Tanoa.' That being said, Sakhal does have <em>some</em> neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely <em>not</em> worth its asking price as of right now. Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free, and Bohemia knows it."</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an extremely lazy effort from Bohemia Interactive," the player continued. "Bugs that have plagued this game for years go unmentioned, the fabled 'AI overhaul' has been pushed back for <em>years</em>, but now we have a snowy Tanoa with less landmass to explore, and most of the islands they left intact are just completely empty anyways. Joy."</p><p dir="ltr">Others have pointed out that the DLC's more interesting POIs--like the new map's Weather Dome and Volcano--cannot be entered or interacted with whatsoever. Others have pointed out that maps with far more content have been released for free by modders.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Spanel's Beatles-based reaction, Bohemia Interactive has yet to make any further comment on the controversy.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/">Torn Banner Studios</a>, the developer behind Chivalry 2, has just announced that the first Early Access update for No More Room in Hell 2 has been released. This update is called Reinforcement and is currently available for players to explore. No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player, co-op horror shooter that just launched into early access and is already doing pretty well for itself. The Reinforcement update adds a number of quality-of-life fixes, new weapons, a new ending scenario, and additional skills for players to utilize. A montage of some of the features has been created and uploaded to the YouTube channel for No More Room in Hell so you can see what to expect from this update.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.0 Reinforcement Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_cMfhGCILQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with any update, the Reinforcement update will also fix a number of bugs and provide a well-needed balance across all difficulties. This will mean that the harder difficulties will be more challenging and will be a lot harsher on the player than they previously were. Additionally, the UI and UX has been improved for easier viewing and navigation, as well as allowing players to remove HUD elements should they feel the need to.</p>
<p>In this update for No More Room in Hell 2, Zombies will now have more natural reactions to damage, as well as improved hit responses to make the combat a smoother experience. As stated above, a new alternate ending scenario has been added to the game. This ending scenario is specifically for the Power Plant map and helps provide more variety for those who have a lot of experience with the game thus far.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement update also adds new weapons for players to experiment with, including the M7A1 Assault Rifle and the M1911A1 Pistol. Alongside this, players will have access to new skills to play with, as well as character generator rules.</p>
<p>On the official X account for this game, they have shared their <a href="https://x.com/nmrih/status/1848433282918322431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access Roadmap</a>, which includes some of the features that have been added or updated in today's update. They still have a ton of plans for what will come next in the game, such as the infection system. There are also concept ideas that they are toying with, including new maps, weapon attachments, and alternative game modes for players to dive into.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292000/view/4452465569899216931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full blog post here</a> to find out all of the little tweaks they've done in the Reinforcement update so you know what to expect when you next play No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed doors without a game to their name</a>. Now, sadly, it's the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have "paused operations" after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.</p><!--more-->
<p>Worlds Untold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-the-original-mass-effect-writers-is-making-a-sci-fi-near-future-action-adventure">revealed themselves in November 2023</a> as the creators of "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding", boasting a mixture of Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> alumni. Their first game is or was to be a "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". Back at announcement, Walters spoke of moving away from the space opera RPGs he's worked on in the past and embracing something more linear, perhaps influenced by Naughty Dog's creations. </p>
<p>"It's hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we've made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life," Walters wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">a LinkedIn post</a> this week. "This was not a decision we made lightly - it's been a deeply personal journey, and we're all so proud of everything this team has built together.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities," it continues. "If you're looking for passionate, talented professionals, please reach out - I'd be honored to connect you with some of the best people I've ever worked with.</p><p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold. While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."</p>
<p>Departing team members have been quoting the post and providing their own context. While Walters ends his message on a more hopeful note, the takeaway seems to be that Worlds Untold as it stands will effectively cease to exist. "Very sad and gutted, especially so close to the holidays," writes former senior gameplay designer Elaine Gómez. "Our entire studio is getting laid off at end of year." Former senior producer Kitty Lee is also describing the announcement as a "full studio shutdown".</p>
<p>2024 continues to be an awful year for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, including at studios run by veteran blockbuster developers looking to start afresh. The gutting of Worlds Untold and Humanoid Origin follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">the closure of Netflix's Team Blue</a>, another studio founded by blockbuster veterans that never managed to announce a single game. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> developers Inflexion - founded by BioWare's former general manager Aaryn Flynn - have also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-cant-outfly-the-stark-realities-of-the-industry-as-creators-inflexion-close-uk-office-and-lay-people-off">announced cutbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody at Worlds Untold now looking for a new job.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>



<h6 id="h-vote-now-insider-gaming-year-end-awards">VOTE NOW: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/announcements.25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Year-End Awards</a></h6>



<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bellwrights-villages-2-0-update-goes-live-discounted-for-steam-autumn-sale/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been getting stuck into Bellwright, the title by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bellwright-launches-later-this-month-in-early-access-heres-a-lengthy-qa-with-the-devs/">Donkey Crew</a>, then you'd better prepare for the latest update to come to the game. The Villages 2.0 update has gone live today, adding a ton of new content and quality-of-life updates for the game. If you've been eyeing up this game, Bellwright will be discounted during the Steam Autumn Sale, which begins today. To celebrate the update, a new trailer has been released to showcase some of the changes and new features that have been added to the town-building survival RPG. During the Steam Autumn Sale, Bellwright will have a 10% discount, bringing the game's cost down to $26.99. This discount will be running from November 27 through December 4</p>
<p><iframe title="Villages 2.0 Update | Bellwright" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jOejfIwzkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most significant changes in the Bellwright update is how you can interact with villages once you've liberated them. You are now given the ability to call militia from the village to your aid, which can prove to be beneficial if you are fighting against stronger enemies. In addition, villages now have a prosperity level, which affects the population, the strength of the militia, and the realm of possibilities for expanding it.</p>
<p>With this update, town customization has now been improved. You can now add buildable roads, which will help provide more realism to your settlement and help plan the layout of the village. There are also new decorations you can add to make your town stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>While these are the main key features, there is a lot of quality-of-life updates that are key to making a difference to Bellwright and making the experience more enjoyable. This includes the ability to set up structure settings before the construction is finished, as well as fast traveling with companions along the rivers using the River Dock structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1812450/view/4472732402493426308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of patch notes</a> is available to read on Steam, where you can find out more about the bandit migration system, as well as the tweaks made to the strategic overlay on the map. The patch notes are quite extensive, and you can tell that Donkey Crew has put a lot of work into the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-reveals-post-malones-murder-circus-its-biggest-event-yet.1046553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crytek has announced a major new crossover event for&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, and it's set to be the game's "biggest event yet", according to the developer.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named Post Malone's Murder Circus event will serve as a crossover between&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>and - who else? - music artist Post Malone, whose work crosses genres like hip-hop, alternative rock, and country.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-soon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> (no pun intended) on the official&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>website, Post Malone's Murder Circus will bring a "unique blend of gothic horror and surreal carnival corruption" to players who "dare" to experience it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=AsZTgVOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=o1H9IM6l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>is about to get circus-level spooky.</figcaption></figure><p>The event will cast Post as a character called the Deposed King, who once led "a twisted carnival corrupted by the dark power of the HelioStone". He's now out to destroy the stone, recruiting "bounty hunters, desperadoes, and suchlike" to help him.</p>

<p>In practical terms, the collaboration will introduce a major new Monster in the form of Ursa Mortis, a pair of conjoined orphaned bear cubs transformed into a twisted monstrosity. They'll "charge at Hunters and attack with a lethal roar".</p>

<p>You can also expect new themed skins, weapon variants, and enemies in the collaboration, all of which will be wrapped up in a "surreal carnival-inspired aesthetic" combining&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>'s gritty shooter mechanics with Post Malone's unique style.</p>




<p>More information about Post Malone's Murder Circus, including a release date and extra details about what kind of goodies you can expect from the event, will be released in the future.</p>

<p>If you missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>hype, it's essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">a rework</a> for extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>. As well as a release for current-gen consoles, the updated version of the game also introduces a new biome, tech upgrades for the engine, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown-1896/9nprv0r4cs1z" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

Instead of just wondering what the better response was when your opponent had you stuck in a corner, you can use Replay Takeover to visit that moment and figure out what other options you had. You can take over from any point in the match and restart there as much as needed until you’re satisfied. It’s a great learning tool that’s a lot more efficient than trying to recreate these situations in Training mode.</p><h2 id="h191763"><a id="use"></a>How to Use Replay Takeover?</h2><figure id="" data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can access Replay Takeover anytime you’re watching a Replay against another player. Thankfully, accessing your replays is a lot easier than it was previously. Here are the steps to follow:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>On the Main Menu, go down to Learn and then select Replays.</li><li>Choose the Replay you want to see and select Watch.</li><li>Navigate to any part and press in the left or right analog sticks to take control of the Player One or Player Two characters respectively. Alternately, press the Pause button and select the options there.</li><li>Press Restart (View button for Xbox or Touch Pad for PlayStation) at any time to return to the moment you took control.</li><li>Once you’re satisfied, press in the left stick to end control and go back to watching the replay.</li></ul><p>It’s important to remember that while you have only 20 seconds to take control of one fighter, the other will stick to the same inputs of the replay. Unless you’re practicing how to get around a long combo string, you should get used to restarting. Things can start looking weird after interrupting the other player’s actions and changing the order and timing of their inputs.</p><hr><p>It’s exciting to see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> embrace Replay Takeover, and I cannot recommend the feature highly enough. This is a wonderful tool that allows for more practical learning than most Training modes offer. No matter if you’re new to the game or playing online ranked every day, Replay Takeover is sure to help you improve.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems Hunt: Showdown is following in the footsteps of titles like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty, with big-name collaborations with other franchises and musical artists. As it were, this one makes a little sense. It turns out that Post Malone is a massive fan of Hunt: Showdown, having spent over 400 hours playing the horror-based extraction shooter while on tour. As such, Crytek partnered with the rapper-turned-country-singer for a collaboration known as Post Malone’s Murder Circus—the game’s most significant event to date!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-post-malone-s-murder-circus-event">What is Post Malone’s Murder Circus Event?</h2>



<p>Hunt: Showdown’s first major event with a celebrity, Post Malone’s Murder Circus, transports players into the same nightmare universe as the rest of the extraction shooter, albeit with a twist. You’re thrust into a murderous traveling circus, transformed by an artifact known as the HelioStone. The former Ringmaster, the Deposed King, played by Post Malone, enters the fray.</p>



<p>The event features a new monster, Ursa Mortis, an orphaned bear cub with a deformed body and endless hunger. It stalks the Circus in search of prey to consume. Along with the terrifying creature, the map itself is unique, awe-inspiring, and downright dreadful in equal measure. And yes, you’ll encounter horrific clown enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-yeah-post-malone-is-a-huge-fan-of-hunt-showdown">Yeah, Post Malone is a Huge Fan of Hunt: Showdown</h2>



<p>Talking about the game, Post said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re either hundred percent in or you’re done. I could either rock this dude and send him off, or I’m totally naked…. Every game I’m shaking, like this is awesome. Whenever you pull it off, I feel like I’m the best player in the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And on bringing Post Malone into the project, Game Director Scott Lussier said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such a passionate and high-profile Hunt fan such as Post Malone. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has always been about creating immersive, high-stakes gameplay. And with Post Malone’s Murder Circus, we’re bringing a new level of intensity and dark entertainment to the Hunt universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we were starting Aftermath, <a href="https://x.com/papapishu/status/1721983205476057469?s=46&amp;t=j3I4mG5u4HJArgR7jOFk_g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I posted the following</a>: “If this website does really well I’m gonna buy a candy cab or something and blog about it.” Well, it is time to make good on that promise. When I saw a listing for a Taiwanese arcade machine priced to move and in project status, I decided to go all in. I am now the owner of a mangy, abused candy cab. What have I done?</p><figure><figcaption>A secret, hidden tier list.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>The Baby has arrived.</figcaption></figure><p>A “candy cab” is an arcade machine. The best known ones are Japanese, like the Astro City, and were usually produced by companies like SEGA, CAPCOM, Taito, Konami and Namco. Unlike horrible American arcade machines, which were made of particle board and designed to be briefly played standing up at a pizzeria, the candy cab was designed to be played sitting down, often while chain smoking. They are usually made out of sturdy, injected molded plastic and are designed so that the operator can easily swap out games, service the machine, and rotate the monitor for shmups (this is known as <a href="https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?t=8290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TATE mode</a>).</p><figure><figcaption>There are tons of OK Baby cabinets out there. They're common, can be gotten for a low price and are made of lightweight but durable ABS plastic. For project lovers, </figcaption></figure><p>The machine I got is called a Weche OK Baby, a Taiwanese clone of a Jaleco Pony Mark IV. Every time I get into a hobby I preemptively join every niche Facebook group related to that, and this paid dividends: I saw that the owner of <a href="https://yubiparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YubiParts</a> had imported a bunch of them from China, well-used machines in imperfect shape in Yonkers (they still have a few available if you are in the New York City Area). They are not as well-known as their Japanese counterparts, so there are very few people importing these machines in the New York area. <a href="https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/ok-babies-250-650-astro-cities-soon-right-outside-nyc.31859/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The price was right, and so me and my friends decided to check it out</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://wiki.arcadeotaku.com/w/WeChe_OK_Baby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>The original color of this plastic was much closer to this due to nicotine and general ABS yellowing. Via: Arcade Otaku Wiki</figcaption></figure><p>You may ask: Chris, was that machine originally that yellow color? No! You are looking at decades of nicotine and plastic yellowing covering this thing. It is not in ideal shape. If you buy a cabinet like this the prevailing advice is to get one you know works or else you are going to have a very long, drawn out project on your hands. Since long, drawn out projects have become my thing, I could not say no. This was reinforced by the revelation that my beautiful, perfect girlfriend had been planning something similar for my birthday anyway.</p><p>Sure, I will have to clean every inch of this thing, but luckily I have a comprehensive list of hyper-specific <a href="https://aftermath.site/industrial-cleaning-kimwipes-tergazyme-fast-orange-thymol-lens-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning products at my disposal</a>. I will probably replace both the monitor and the chassis, potentially with something that can do tri-sync resolutions, but luckily I know how to <a href="https://aftermath.site/fixing-a-crt-is-fun-enriching-and-possibly-very-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discharge a CRT and replace capacitors on a vintage TV</a>. I am going to put a MiSTercade in there to fill it up with countless games, <a href="https://aftermath.site/mister-pi-de-10-nano-clone-board-taki-udon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and luckily those have gotten far less expensive</a>.

I am going to need help, not just from the many people supporting <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath</a> (thank you), but also arcade enthusiasts in the area who do this for fun. This OK Baby is going to need a lot of love, and I can’t wait to share my progress with you.</p><figure><figcaption>Did I have to remove the door from its hinges to get it into my office?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an official PlayStation podcast interview, Shuhei Yoshida made the announcement that he will be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment after working there for 31 years. His official leaving date is January 15, 2025. He has had some truly <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-games-becoming-live-service-games-would-be-boring-sonys-shuhei-yoshida-says/">iconic moments</a> throughout his time at PlayStation. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUY6qXiLFXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling asleep during a monologue from David Cage</a> in 2013 to the iconic video demonstrating how to share games on PS4 right after Microsoft's failed Xbox One announcement. Throughout the years, he's become a very well-known face at the company, and in 2019, he made the decision to encourage indie developers to publish their games for PlayStation. As a result of his major contributions to the gaming industry, he was awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship in 2023.</p>
<p>In the official PlayStation Podcast interview, he explained his decision to leave the company and some of the best moments he's had while working there.</p>
<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company's been doing great. I love PlayStation 5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time."</p>
<p>At the moment, Yoshida has said that he has no plans for what's next, but that he would like to stay in the industry to continue to help independent game developers. For now, though, he has been traveling a lot, meeting with developers, and attending game events. He's also been looking at new and upcoming games while making sure to post about games that he has enjoyed throughout the year.</p>
<p>Yoshida originally joined Ken Kutanagi's team in February 1993 when they were still developing the original PlayStation. The team consisted exclusively of engineers, and Yoshida joined as the first person who wasn't in a technical role. In this role, he was in charge of talking to publishers and developers in Japan to try and get them to create games on PlayStation.</p>
<p>If you want to hear everything that Shuhei Yoshida has to say about his 31 years at PlayStation, you can listen to the podcast on Apple or Spotify. Alternatively, you can read the transcript between Sid Shuman and Shuhei Yoshida on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/hametsu-miniatures-showcase-heroes-and-enemies-of-cataclysm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>We recently reviewed the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook, which you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but the rulebook is only the start of your journey and here we're going to delve into the <em>Hametsu&nbsp;</em>miniatures that represent the characters during the game. You can use any miniatures for this miniature agnostic system, but Black Site Studios produces a full range of heroes and enemies for every profile in the rulebook, and also those that have been released after. In this article, we'll have a look at the heroes, enemy units, and boss miniatures and how they work in the game.</p>



<p>Hametsu includes a whole host of heroes to choose from when creating your party, and these all come under the 3 core schools from the Hametsu rulebook, the bonus school from the campaign, and an additional school that has been released separately since.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=yQvlYwj_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=luACUu6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Magic</h4>

<p>The School of Magic focuses on those who harness otherworldly energies through various forms.</p>

<ul><li>Onmyoji - These magic users focus on&nbsp;elemental energies, starting with access to the lightning bolt ranged ability, building through options for chain lightning, spirit summoning, and ending with Lifeforce Detonation where they can channel their own hit points into dealing damage to enemies.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Bunraku - The students of death magic are similar to the more widely known necromancers. They start with the ability to weaken enemies, lowering their resilience, and can level up through controlling lesser enemies, to control of small zombie hordes.</li>
	<li>Monk - These spiritual magic users have the highest body outside of the school of strength, and they use their progress to build into a talented martial warrior with attacks like suppressing palm, and eventually flurry of blows.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=0VCpV5B6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=SOksIYA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Stealth</h4>

<p>My favorite School, and I'm going to try an entire School of Stealth party at some point to see how they fare. They obviously focus on the less forward arts of combat.</p>

<ul><li>Shinobi - These ninjas and&nbsp;masters of stealth excel at remaining hidden and boost their abilities to do so as they level up with Master of Hiding, the amazing video game nod, Get Over Here attack, and finally have the option for the Faces of Death ability at the highest level where they can create duplicates of themselves.</li>
	<li>Geisha - These performers use their abilities for distraction, gaining bonuses if they use attacks and songs in the same activation. Their songs build up from Soothing Serenade, Hypnotic Dance, and then to Divine Cacophony that can damage all nearby enemies.</li>
	<li>Matagi - The stealthy ranged warriors get a boost&nbsp;to their ranged damage if attacking outside of a target's line of sight.&nbsp;They get to focus their leveling up on their ranged attacks with volley&nbsp;of arrows and chain shot and with traps like the tripwire and the pit which can trap enemies and then remove them instantly if the Matagi is able to spend an action to remove it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=MJ-Fftqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=Ej53_XlL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Strength</h4>

<p>The core warriors of <em>Hametsu</em> come in three varieties of melee-focused combat.</p>

<ul><li>Ronin - These masterless samurai are what you expect from a feudal Japanese setting, and they don't disappoint. They start with Iaijutsu, which is the art of drawing and striking, and they deal 2 extra damage to an enemy when they first damage them each game. Their prowess also comes across as they gain levels, with Intimidating Presence, and finally with the option to take Undeniable Legend, which lets them chain attacks across the board if they can reach an enemy with a move after defeating the previous target.</li>
	<li>Gaijin - These foreign knights specialize in wearing armor and high-damage attacks. They can take the Wide Swing attack to target multiple enemies at Level 5, and Descendant of Heroes at the final level, which lets them attack an enemy when they're reduced to 0 wounds, staying alive if they slay their target.</li>
	<li>Sumo - The famous large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand combat have the highest starting body points. They have the wonderfully thematic starting ability, Sacred Dohyo, which boosts their attacks and mind if they stay within the token. They can gain grapple and toss abilities as they level up, finally gaining access to the Greater Dohyo, which uses 6 templates inside of 1 and improves the boosted abilities.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=Mc0XyQYl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=alXSefPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Corruption</h4>

<p>This bonus school is included as part of the Wolf and the Devil campaign, and players should play through the campaign before looking to use this school.</p>

<ul><li>Ketto - These are fast dual-wielding warriors who can gain the effects of two weapons when they attack. Other enemies will struggle to keep up with them when they level up, gaining Master of the Duel which gives an enemy -1 melee if they are the only one engaged with the Ketto, and gaining the option for the Flashing Whirlwind ability which can damage all enemies they move through.</li>
	<li>Kaeru - These stealthy acrobatic hunters are able to parkour around the battlefield, leveling up to attack multiple opponents and at the highest level, moving enemies with their attack for massive damage.</li>
	<li>Doku - The poison users are able to dish out poison counters, increasing the damage each counter deals as they level up to 10 per counter at the highest levels.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=QfLi8fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=bl1p-Xd5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Elements</h4>

<p>The School of Elements is an extra school, with the rules available when you purchase the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-school-of-elements?variant=44885405040881" rel="nofollow">physical or digital miniatures</a> from Black Site Studios.</p>

<ul><li>Sora - The Sora harnesses the unseen energy in all things. They have a level 1 ability option that if they use both actions to perform in a single turn, boosts their stats (and reduces their resilience) for the rest of the game. They gain buff and debuff abilities as they level up, and one of their options at the highest level is a spell&nbsp;to resurrect a hunter that has been removed from the game, with full health points, making them an incredible asset on the battlefield.</li>
	<li>Hikaze - These warriors are fueled by fire and air, dishing out burning counters and fire attacks culminating in the Flames of Ambition ability that allows them to put any number of burn counters on themselves, gaining +1 mind or melee for each, but taking 8 damage for each unless they spend an action to put out the flames. This allows them to produce a single incredible attack, and possibly combust at the end of it.</li>
	<li>Tsuchimizu - These monks harness the power of earth and water, making them resilient in body and mind. The Level 6 Level Ground ability is one of my favorites, letting them remove a piece of terrain and damage all enemies on it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=TVAupGnH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=Ulv8LMdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Enemies Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>The Cataclysm caused a whole host of demonic horrors to pour from the portal. The core rulebook focuses on different types of Oni (Japanese demons).</p>

<ul><li>Lesser Oni - The lesser oni are the weakest of the various types of Oni, but they like to fight in packs, and their melee increases if they can gang up on a hunter.</li>
	<li>Oni - More effective than their lesser counterparts, they get a boost to their melee if they make a second attack in their activation.</li>
	<li>Oni Marksman - Firearm-carrying&nbsp;Oni, they can spot hunters at a longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Lookout - These Oni carry longbows, and like the Marksman, can spot hunters at longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Captain - The captains are the most dangerous of the Oni. They are more effective in combat and inspire other Oni engaged with the same hunter. If the Oni Captain damages a hunter, another random Oni also engaged with that hunter gets a free attack.</li>
	<li>Oni Shaman - The Shaman is a magic user and has a unique set of AI to attack, escape, and heal itself depending on its location in relation to the hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=iit-bpFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=FAYxe0c3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once the Hunters have found enough clues, the boss of the scenario appears. The <em>Hametsu</em> ore rulebook contains 6 bosses, all with their own unique challenge to beat.</p>

<ul><li>Enenra - These monsters are made of smoke and ash, which makes them hard to land attacks&nbsp;on. They drift around the battlefield, trying to sneak up behind hunters and devour them.</li>
	<li>Daitengu - These winged Tengu are superb fighters and offer one of the hardest face-to-face challenges. Their Sword of the Wind attack pushes hunters away, and they deal damage when they successfully defend against the hunters'&nbsp;attacks.</li>
	<li>Shikigami - These random sprits are unpredictable, moving a random amount in a random direction each turn, with all nearby hunters having to save against a deathly cold attack, and then the furthest&nbsp;hunter from the Shikigami automatically taking damage from its Horrible Memory attack.</li>
	<li>Nogitsune - This nine-tailed fox always heads for the hunter with the lowest starting body and attacks. If it damages a hunter, it can attack again twice more, and with 2 core attacks each turn, it can really ramp up the damage if you don't defend well.</li>
	<li>Komainu - These stone lion-dogs are extremely hardy, starting with the most body points of all the bosses and if you damage them too much, they get a free attack the following turn. They also have a charge attack which pushes all hunters in its path and damages them, so positioning is key when fighting this boss.</li>
	<li>Ogumo - This giant spider does what you would expect a giant spider to do, it shoots webs, and heads straight for its chosen prey, grasping them and attacking them until they're subdued. It also moves around the battlefield, carrying the hunter they've grasped and dogging the other hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=x9osOdOO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=N5_L9TSW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Raid Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once hunters have progressed to Level 8, the bosses get easier, and they look for tougher enemies to bring down. These enemies are known as Raid Bosses, and battles with them don't follow the normal rules. There's no stealth or clash phase, players jump straight into the battle with the Raid Boss. The STLs for the miniatures for these bosses are available in the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-digital-products" rel="nofollow">Digital Downloads section</a> of the <em>Hametsu</em> products page.</p>

<ul><li>Omukade - The rules for this raid boss are in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. This giant insect-like boss moves through a series of 7 actions whenever it activates, moving, attacking with pincers, and trying to grasp the hunters, along with activating a series of cold spells. With 1000 body points, it will take a while to bring this enemy down, but each hunter that survives doing so, gets to roll on the Omukade's unique loot table.</li>
	<li>Gashadokuro - The raid rules for this boss can be found for free on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-resources" rel="nofollow">Hametsu resources page</a>. This unique scenario finds the hunters battling and unkillable enemy, and having to survive a number of turns against it until the magics animating it wear out. While the hunters can't defeat the Gashadokuro, they can damage it and reduce its combat effectiveness. Each turn, the Gashadokuro moves through a series of actions, trying to grab and crush the hunters, and releasing death magic to reduce the hunters own effectiveness at trying to survive. Like the all raid bosses, there's a unique loot table that all hunters can roll on if at least 2 survive.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=0AeKWijs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=l2HA9huP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Campaign Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<ul><li>The Wolf and the Devil - I won't go into too much detail about the Wolf and the Devil, as they are part of the narrative campaign of the same name in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. But you can see from the miniature pack&nbsp;that it includes a large spectral wolf and a sturdy-looking devil miniature. You'll have to play through the campaign yourself to find out how you face them and what they're capable of.</li>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow">other Genesis games</a> on Switch Online, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">N64</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-f-zero" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> titles on the service, you'll need the Expansion Pack addon to enjoy these new Genesis games; a basic Switch Online subscription won't cut it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have the Expansion Pack addon, then the first Genesis game you'll be able to enjoy as part of November 2024's haul is the funky platformer&nbsp;<em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em>.</p>

<p>Your next Genesis game for November 2024 is&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>, a 1995 platformer that takes inspiration not only from other platformers like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>but also from run-and-gun affairs like <i>Metal Slug&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a platformer but you're not in the mood for the colorful, high-octane antics of ToeJam and Earl, then&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>'s more somber tone and techno-inspired soundtrack should go a long way towards making you happy.</p>

<p>Finally, the third game being added to the Switch Online library today is the 1991 run-and-gun shmup&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs</em>, also known as simply&nbsp;<em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>or as&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield 2</em>.</p>




<p><em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>plays a lot like top-down shooters along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Smash TV</em>, so if you want something a little more action-oriented than the aforementioned two games, then this one should be right up your street.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available to check out right now if you've got a Nintendo Switch Online membership and an Expansion Pack addon, both of which you can get via your console's eShop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/the-witcher-4-is-now-in-full-production-cdpr-confirms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is now in full scale production, a significant milestone for what is codenamed Project Polaris, that comes over two years after the project was first confirmed.</p>
<p>Game Director <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861447055492682034%7Ctwgr%5E09e8a08c8b542ebc83dd82df60ffea9148ea0cdd%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fthe-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-says%2F">Sebastian Kalemba</a> said on social media:</p>


<p>“I’m thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!”</p>
<p>Entering full production essentially means that the studio is now putting all its resources into building out the game, with the overarching story, gameplay and vision for the game having been settled on during the pre-production phase. Of course, there’s plenty that will still be defined and changed between now and release – they could find that certain game ideas don’t work or aren’t as fun as expected and have to pivot, for example – but the core framework of ideas is now in place.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/the-witcher-4-is-now-in-full-production-cdpr-confirms/">Project Polaris was announced and Kalemba confirmed as game director</a> – he was the Head of Animation and Animation Director on The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 – but there has been a significant technical hurdle to overcome, as CDPR make the jump away from their own in-house game engine to using Unreal Engine 5. That, as we’ve even seen from studios coming over from Unreal Engine 4, has a significant impact on the production pipeline, as developers and artists look to integrate features like Nanite textures and Lumen global illumination into the game.</p>

<p>Another way that CDPR has likely been able to gain experience with Unreal Engine 5 is with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/26/cd-projekt-red-announce-the-witcher-remake-project-canis-majoris/">The Witcher remake</a>, though this project is in the hands of Fool’s Theory – a studio founded by ex-CDPR devs. Fool’s Theory is leading development, but sharing in the technology and tools that CDPR has been building to tie in with Unreal Engine 5, so it’s a great technical testbed for what they want to do.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Palworld Terraria Crossover Announced for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-crossover-announced-for-next-year.1046481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced a&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover for next year, bringing together the worlds of two immensely popular games, although details are fairly light at the moment.</p>

<p>Announcing the crossover <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, Pocketpair promises more info "soon", as well as sharing a piece of artwork that depicts characters from both games clasping their hands together, all while Pals look on in the background.</p>

<p>It's not currently clear whether the crossover goes both ways; presumably, we'll be getting to see&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>characters and locations make their way into&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, but we don't yet know whether the reverse is true as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-pals-ingots.jpg?itok=BGeP9yPn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-pals-ingots.jpg?itok=7BjEfgii 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>are about to cross over.</figcaption></figure><p>We also don't yet know when the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive, though Pocketpair has confirmed it will land sometime in 2025.</p>

<p>In the post announcing the crossover, Pocketpair also announced that "2024 isn't finished yet for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>" and that another update is on the way for the game, with more information about that also coming "very soon".</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that update will be a substantial one, but the fact that Pocketpair describes the news as "exciting" should hopefully be encouraging for those hoping for more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>content before the new year.</p>

<p>All in all, it's fair to say it's been a year of ups and downs for Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. On the plus side, the game launched early in 2024 to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february" rel="nofollow">rapturous reception</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">gamers</a>, cementing its place in the popular zeitgeist as a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>pastiche with enduring appeal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-fishing.jpg?itok=hUwTKG76 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-crossover-fishing.jpg?itok=IQ9FB7fU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What form will the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover take? We don't know yet.</figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, however, it's been a bit of a fraught year for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. Pocketpair was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">sued by Nintendo back in September</a>, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">alleging patent infringement</a>&nbsp;and apparently seeking the cessation of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s sale in Japan.</p>

<p>Of course, none of that stopped&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">launching on PS5</a> this year, nor has it stopped the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">development of a mobile version</a> over at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton. We'll bring you more on this crossover, plus all else <i>Palworld</i>-related, as soon as we get it.</p>
