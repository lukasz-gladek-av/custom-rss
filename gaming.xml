            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision is rumored to launch in Europe before the end of the month, retaining the price of the currently available model.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-version-de-la-ps5-pro-arriverait-bientot-voici-ce-que-lon-croit-en-savoir-60579">Dealabs</a> by billbil-kun, who has proven time and time again to be extremely reliable regarding new video games and hardware launches, it is claimed that a new hardware CFI-7121 hardware revision discovered via Japanese certification documents is in the works and set to be launched in Europe on September 30. The changes to this new hardware revision are expected to be limited to better energy efficiency, so there won't be any change to the console's design nor to the system's SSD capacity, which will remain at 2 TB as in the current model. It is also claimed the new hardware revision system will retain the current €799.99 price tag. A launch in North America is uncertain at the time.</p>



<p>Although the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision has yet to be confirmed officially, given billbil-kun's excellent track record and the listing of the new revision in the same certification documents that confirmed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">existance of the base model Digital Edition CFI-2000 revision</a>, which indeed launched in Europe this week, there's a high probability the system is indeed launching in the region in a few days. </p>



<p>This time around, however, there should be no need to rush to purchase the current PS5 Pro model, as storage will not be reduced as a not-so-subtle way to avoid raising the system's price, which is already high compared to every other current-generation system.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has plenty to offer over the base PlayStation 5 models, including support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">improve next year</a>. You can learn more about what the system exactly offers by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">checking out Kai's review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-hopes-to-turn-the-games-fortunes-around-next-week.1308768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update, and it comes complete with a ton of seismic changes to the first-person shooter, although whether they can turn its fortunes around remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Back in July, Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that it would release&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s first big update in September, and the studio has made good on that promise; Breakpoint launches on September 29th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing).</p>

<p>According to Remedy, Breakpoint is "packed with systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements" with a view towards making&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"more fun, varied, and rewarding to play".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=xXi0Afvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=CdHCAshj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update aims to turn the game's fortunes around on Monday.</figcaption></figure><p>Breakpoint's first big addition to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is the Crisis Board, which will replace the Job Board and offer "curated playable content" in order to make the shooter "feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy" Remedy intends.</p>

<p>The Crisis Board will show you situations emerging around the Oldest House, and you'll be expected to respond to them; after all, Remedy says, you should be "reacting to dynamic, unpredictable dangers" rather than "being asked to create danger for yourself".</p>

<p>You can also expect a brand new tutorial mission by the name of Orientation, which will be "accompanied by onboarding improvements across the game", so if you felt a bit lost when you jumped into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, this should hopefully improve that experience.</p>

<p>There are a ton of other huge changes coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>as part of this update as well, so if you want to know everything that's changing, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full announcement right here</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it's a multiplayer-oriented first-person shooter set in&nbsp;<em>Control</em>'s Oldest House. You play a member of the titular Firebreak team, and it's your job to contain a range of bizarre supernatural threats within the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The game launched back in June to a mixed reception, and player numbers have dwindled significantly since launch according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (although&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is also available on both PS Plus and Game Pass, for which I don't have player data).</p>

<p>Remedy itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">admitted back in August</a> that launch sales of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>had been disappointing, but the studio described the game as having a "solid" foundation and expressed optimism that it could turn the shooter's fortunes around. Breakpoint is, presumably, the first step in that effort.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fbc-firebreak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9PDCN8Z4HKRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available as part of certain tiers of PS Plus and Game Pass as well. Make sure to give our Luis' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-old-house" rel="nofollow">review of the game</a> a read too!</p>

            <p>A year on from its debut, would-be challenger to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ</a>'s 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> throne <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has gotten what looks like its most substantial overhaul yet. So substantial that its developers are hailing this Revolutions update as the arrival of Ara version 2.0, in the same tone of voice you might use for someone who's gotten a swanky new hairdo.</p>
<p>While the base version had a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">fair few hangups</a>, the Xbox folks who're keen to see Ara stand the test of time have pushed plenty of updates and tweaks for it since then. Current developers Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-gets-a-beefy-update-that-promises-significant-micromanagement-reduction-and-more-competent-ai-not-civs">aimed to wipe out a number of the biggest gripes earlier this year</a>, and this latest update aims for plenty of further refinement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/518598560814465237?l=english">Steam post</a>, the update introduces the likes of new culture and influence systems designed to provide an alternative to conquest as they do in Civ, unique historical units for every civilisation, and another unit that's just really annoying. No, seriously, at the end of the Renaissance you can now unlock an "agitator unit" that can be deployed to sow rebellion in other nations and engage in a bit of ideological subversion. We'll see if they're just a slightly less Bondy version of Civ's spies, but colour me intrigued.</p>
<p>Beyond that, leaders have been revamped with "with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities", there's a new priority and quota crafting system to ditch some of the micromanagement that's long plagued Ara, and the AI's been improved with a view to making more realistic moves. The interface, map generation and performance have also been tweaked as part of the update, to round out its main bits.</p>
<p>It certainly looks like a big enough overhaul to make it worth dipping your toe back in if you've previously bounced off of Ara, even if just for a brief fling ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">Civ 7's next update</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-8-in-1-charging-station-is-less-than-1-inch-thick-and-now-within-1-of-its-black-friday-low-2000628715</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-8-in-1-charging-station-is-less-than-1-inch-thick-and-now-within-1-of-its-black-friday-low.1308753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It used to be easy to pick out the most powerful charging stations and power strips. Simply put, bigger was better: The bigger the device, the more plugs it contained; the more plugs it contained, the more power it delivered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4302/">Anker’s set that old-school thinking on its ear with their Prime Charging Station, which is just $100 right now thanks to a 33% limited-time deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Charging Station is definitely not bigger, but it’s definitely better than any of those bulky power strips or charging blocks. With 240 watts of power delivered across 8 outputs that somehow fit in an ultra-compact device that measures 3 x 5.4 inches around and — amazingly — only 0.7 inches thick, it can charge all of your devices while taking up next to no space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>The 8 outputs built into the Anker Prime Charging Station cover the full gamut of charging options to cover all of your devices, from your laptop to your wireless earbuds or other small portable tech. There are 2 AC outlets which can pop up or sit level with the charger, 4 USB-C ports, and 2 USB-A ports. Each USB-C port can carry 140W of output, enough juice to take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from completely dead to 53% charged in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Even when all six USB ports are used at once, the total output of 237W will quickly and safely charge your devices, and that’s while both AC outlets are also in use. The LED screen at the top of the Anker Prime Charging Station shows you the vital charging statistics, including a countdown timer and if any charging errors occur. The Anker app also shows you those statistics from anywhere and more, and also allows you to fully control the charging station, including creating charging schedules.</p>



<h2>Take It To Go</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Charging Station comes with a 5-foot AC power cord, giving you enough slack to place the charging station in your ideal location. It also makes it a great travel charger, especially since the power cord is detachable for easier storage and transport. As with most of Anker’s high-end chargers, the Prime Charging Station comes with ActiveShield 3.0 and PowerIQ 4.0 technology to protect both the charging station and all of your devices from surges, overheating, and other electrical hazards.</p>

    <p><span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio-developed fighter features two distinct battle rules.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > SEGA [2,700 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">SEGA</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio [509 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega/ryu-ga-gotoku-studio">Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</a> have released a new information for the new <em>Virtua Fighter</em> project, detailing the game’s battle system and gameplay rules. <span id="more-996442"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>This game offers two distinct battle rules to suit different playstyles and preferences:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard</strong> – Victory is determined by either depleting the opponent’s health or causing a ring out. By default, matches are won by taking three rounds.</li><li><strong>Uprising</strong> – A completely new battle rule that introduces dynamic momentum-shifting opportunities, offering a new gameplay concept that stands apart from standard rules.</li></ul><p>The game also features three groundbreaking battle systems that drive the evolution of the series:</p><ul><li><strong>Break &amp; Rush</strong> – This innovative system introduces a dynamic damage accumulation mechanic. As specific regions of the body take repeated hits, damage builds up, eventually allowing for a targeted break. Once the attacker lands a break attack, they gain a strategic advantage, opening up new offensive opportunities. A ”broken” status carries over across rounds, creating a tactical layer that adds depth and tension to every match.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

                <p dir="ltr">Back-to-back Black Ops game releases are somewhat worrying from a fatigue perspective for Call of Duty developer Treyarch. Black Ops 7 is set to launch November 14, just a little more than a year after Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1971198001361428860" rel="nofollow ">CharlieIntel</a>, Treyarch senior director of production Yale Miller discussed whether launching Black Ops 7 right after Black Ops 6 was a concern for the team. "I think the honest answer is yes. I worry about that," said Miller via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-admit-theyre-worried-about-series-fatigue-after-back-to-back-games-3255551/" rel="nofollow ">Dexerto</a>. "Obviously, there was a plan with the two [Modern Warfare] games and then this. We'll see what the franchise does in the future."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Miller pointed out that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 followed a similar pattern in 2022 and 2023, respectively. To combat possible Black Ops fatigue, Miller laid out Treyarch's strategy with Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're absolutely going to bring it from a content perspective in our live seasons," Miller said. "How can we have new gameplay experiences? More content, more maps, weeklies, with functional stuff like deeper weapon prestige experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Treyarch revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-adds-zombie-bears-bees-and-a-pack-a-punched-vehicle/2900-7070/#1">new details about Zombies in Black Ops 7</a>. Taking place on the Ashes of the Damned map, players can utilize an armored truck called Ol' Tessie as well as fight a zombie bear named Zursa.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">Black Ops 7 will get a multiplayer beta</a> next month, with early access beginning October 2 and then opening up to everyone else October 5.

The small taste of the FPS--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/">which will include Zombies</a>--will run through October 8.</p><p>The full release for Black Ops 7 is slated for November 14. The game is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Treyarch recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-still-played-by-a-shocking-number-of-people-on-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6534986/">a "shocking" number of people still play Call of Duty on last-generation consoles</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Puzzle game <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> is all about <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> — not crushing, elephant-on-your-chest anxiety, but the small instances of overthinking that come up throughout an average day of life as a human. Where should you sit on the bus&nbsp; when one side has middle schoolers playing competing terrible music as loud as their phones will go, and the other is home to some passenger’s stinky takeout food? In the world of <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em>, characters — represented as shapes like triangles or squares — don’t have to fix those worries for themselves. You, the player, take on that task, placing characters so everyone fits on the bus, movie theater, or cafeteria happily.</p><p>The first time I played the game, it was about 8:30 a.m. and I’d already been up for an hour. I woke up in my sunny apartment on 14th Street in Washington, D.C. to a whistle blowing just outside and someone screaming “ICE” at the top of their lungs. I donned my KN95 mask both for obscurity and safety and joined in with my neighbors, who were surrounding an unmarked vehicle with an armed, masked ICE agent inside. We shouted until the vehicle pulled away, following the car down the street. Then we moved on to another car that was parked across the street (I’ve anecdotally noticed that one ICE agent means another is likely nearby), first verifying that the unmarked vehicle was in fact an ICE agent by peering through the highly tinted windows until we could see a stocky man in the hallmark bulletproof vest in the driver’s seat. Many of the ICE agents active in D.C. right now wear unofficial garb like black buffs and nondescript vests that anyone can purchase online. In this case, our suspicions were verified when a Metro police officer drove up and told us to stop harassing a stranger. “It’s ICE,” we said. He had the agent roll down the window, confirmed it was ICE, then told us to leave them alone and let them do their job.&nbsp;</p><p>On this particular morning we shouted and shamed and told our neighbors, many of them on their way to drop their children off at school, to take another route. <a href="https://www.dcmigrantmutualaid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network</a>, one of the prominent activist groups in D.C. focused on immigrant safety, asks that allies who see ICE activity make as much noise as possible by blowing whistles or screaming “ICE” or “la migra” — anything to prevent ICE from abducting people with no witnesses. Eventually the second car left, and a few people followed it further up 14th Street. I saw online later that day that ICE had a checkpoint set up at 14th and U streets, evilly placed right where the Green Line lets out and where so many rideshare drivers make their money. This was a typical day under the <a href="https://51st.news/national-guard-dc-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">occupation of the National Guard</a> and the Metro Police Department, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/14/trump-dc-crime-arrests-data-federal-takeover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federalized and militarized</a> by President Trump for the sake of “safety” in the District.</p><p>So while I was looking forward to playing an indie game that was supposedly all about life’s little anxieties, <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> landed differently for me. Still calming myself from the adrenaline rush of that morning’s events, I launched the game and started dragging the little triangles onto the bus, making sure kids were with their parents and besties could sit together and nobody who wanted to sleep was too close to someone noisy. But instead of feeling anxiety about the game’s puzzles, or satisfaction when I solved them, I felt jealous. I was jealous that the characters in the game worried about smell and having a nice view rather than whether someone might be an undercover ICE agent and what that could mean for the people around them. I was jealous of the public spaces themselves, held back by too few seats rather than an intense and highly-armed police presence that scared everyone off. I was jealous of the chaos of the game — the natural chaos that occurs when a bunch of people gather, not the manufactured chaos that occurs when 15 police cars block up a major road just to do <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/09/12/washington-ice-iowa-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">car checks</a> at random.</p><p>The truth is that for me, a youngish, wealthyish white woman, my worries when I’m in public are typically similar to those in <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em>. The privilege isn’t just about safety in public; I’ve been just fine pushing the limits with law enforcement for my entire activist life. It’s also about the privilege of choice — to choose whether I’d like to take the Metro, hop in a rideshare, or walk to my destination based on budget and vibe, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/09/child-care-workers-ice-dc-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the location of today’s ICE checkpoint</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when I change my route or plans to try to defend my neighbors from ICE, I still have the privilege to avoid these confrontations if I need or want to. The same morning I chased those ICE cars off of my block with my neighbors, a woman walked by on her phone, chattering on her way to work: “Something’s going on, I guess,” she said. “Everyone’s so loud.” It’s tempting to be inspired by how the community has banded together, but many of D.C’s white transplants like me are still able to be more concerned with the everyday issues of sharing space than protecting our neighbors before, during, and after this occupation.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish for myself and for my neighbors that we could spend our time focusing on the little concerns that crop up in third spaces like the park or the bus — spaces that are less populated than normal, especially on days when ICE activity is high. But <em>Is This Seat Taken? </em>has also become a reminder of how I <em>don’t</em> want to be in public, ever and especially during a fascist takeover. People might be loud or unkempt in public for all sorts of reasons, and thinking about how my neighbors move through space due to ICE threats reminds me to extend grace to them rather than engineer ways to avoid proximity to them. I would far rather sit beside someone with bad breath for 10 minutes on the bus than never see them again because the state abducted them.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, when I head to the Metro station, I scan for police and troops in uniform, check to see what weapons they’re carrying, and try to position myself between them and any people of color I can see. I film the troops in Dupont Circle, for posterity and because anything can happen at any time. I shout when it is time to shout. I eat a spoonful of honey to soothe my voice after interactions with the police, who are everywhere.</p><p>What Trump and his puppets haven’t accounted for is D.C.’s <a href="https://freedcproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community</a> of immigrants and allies who know exactly what to do when your government becomes a military and existing in public becomes surveillance. The occupation can force us into meeting in the back of a cafe or someone’s living room instead of the park, but community will thrive nonetheless. That’s the community I’m proud to be part of — the one that’s working towards a day when we can all ride the bus together again without fear.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/easy-delivery-co-impressions-review"><h3>Finding Peace In Work</h3></a><p>I've had a great time playing Easy Delivery Co.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soulframe-bear-stomach-interview-digital-extremes"><h3>Inside The Soulframe Scene Where You Go Inside A Bear</h3></a><p>"There is a running gag that I watched over 40 hours of bear colonoscopy videos"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism"><h3>I Love Silksong Even When It Bugs Me</h3></a><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a once-in-a-generation platformer and a labor of love.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been a mixed year for Monster Hunter. Wilds released to much furore, hardly surprising when it’s the most visually impressive, mechanically complete, and approachable entry in the series to date, but Capcom have really struggled to nail down the game’s performance on PC, and players soon realised that with the lowered difficulty and small-scale updates, it was a shorter-lived game. But maybe Monster Hunter Outlanders can be the antidote?</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Outlanders Tokyo Game Show 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPiHE4-UvIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Capcom, Level Infinite and developers Timi are hoping to change Monster Hunter’s fortunes in 2025 with Monster Hunter Outlanders. This all-new, original title is coming to Mobile (and perhaps PC if you’re smart enough to do some Android emulating), bringing with it the whole Monster Hunter experience, rather than a cut-down mobile version you’d have expected even a few years ago.</p>


<p>Oho ho. This <em>is</em> Monster Hunter. If you’ve played any of the games before, the action is immediately recognisable and fluid, and specifically, it feels like a proper Monster Hunter title. It starts, though, with choosing a character, and there’s a mix of all-new characters with their own look and special skills, alongside the traditional adventurer who’s capable of using any of the included 14 weapons.</p>
<p>They range from Pepe, who uses a Heavy Bowgun, leaping into the air and attacking freely while she’s airborne, through to Madelyne, who attaches spores to monsters while attacking with her Bow, detonating them when they reach a high enough stack. Midori is pegged as an ideal choice for Monster Hunter veterans, using a Long Sword, and retaining the classic Spirit Gauge mechanic, though with better mobility and more ways to build Spirit Gauge.</p>


<p>Staying true to type, I went with Great Sword, though after Wilds, I’m also thoroughly happy playing with the Bow. The character design is once again clearly Monster Hunter, though there’s a perhaps a slight move towards a more Eastern-influenced design rather than Western. It looks like the pre-built characters have been designed to pick up and play a little easier, and as the ones in our demo are largely ranged combatants, it feels like they’re supposed to stay out of danger.</p>
<p>I definitely did not stay out of danger. Our hands-on gave us two monsters to fight, the Radiant Pukei Pukei and the Radiant Rathalos. Both of them were instantly recognisable, but while much of their moveset remains unchanged, there’s a few new moves that will surprise and delight returning fans and veterans. That saw Pukei Pukei raining down poison in a larger AOE attack, while Rathalos’ flame attacks became even more dangerous.</p>

<p>Timi might have eyed up a little bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/wild-hearts-s-review/">Wild Hearts</a> when it was creating Outlanders too, and there’s some new traversal mechanics to help you get around the levels faster, starting with the zipline, which takes you from A to B with ease. There’s also the Ballista, which can fire you semi-gracefully into the sky, from where you can make use of the Breath of the Wild-style glider to get above your prey before hammering down on them with a weapon blow.</p>
<p>There’s also a grappling hook, and maybe even more things that we haven’t seen, but they help to make getting around much easier, even without a Palamute or Seikret to ride on, which has recently become my biggest worry for any future Monster Hunter games. Seriously, do you remember when we had to run everywhere? Outlanders seems to be getting this right, and there’s also fast travel back to camp to keep frustration at a minimum and the hunts coming thick and fast.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about Outlanders is that playing on a touchscreen still worked well, though if you have the option of a controller, you’re going to take that every time. Alongside your regular attacks, with standard combos coming through repeated presses, there’s a series of more mobile moves, a dodge, and then the special move, which lets you dish out some major damage as well as looking very cool.</p>

<p>We were joined through this hunt by an AI character, and I hope that remains an option in the full release, as it’s not always convenient to play with others, something only amplified by the mobile format. There’s also your Palico, and an owl pal called a Trillan, who can help out with some airborne healing, and other support skills, if you need it. He kept me alive once or twice in the heat of battle, and he’s pretty cute to boot. I assume you’ll be able to dress him up with some finery like the rest of your crew.</p>
<p>Visually, Outlanders looks smart and detailed, with lush greenery stretching off into the distance, and the monsters look as good as they have done elsewhere, at least as good as the Hi-Res PS5 version of Monster Hunter Ride. Outlanders is clearly pushing the current crop of mobile hardware pretty hard. Our test unit was an iPhone 16 Pro, and even with a cooling fan, they were running pretty warm – something the 17 Pro has tried to solve that problem. That said, they were also pulling all-day duty on the Tokyo Game Show floor, and by the time I played, they’d have been running for at least four hours, so maybe we shouldn’t put too much stock in that.</p>
<p>I’ve been left impressed and hopeful by Monster Hunter Outlanders. It seems like a true entry in the Monster Hunter franchise, and one which marries classic action with a more recognisable hunting loop. If they get the customisation and crafting right – and there’s not too much in the way of aggressive monetisation – then I can see it being a huge hit on mobile when it launches for iOS and Android.</p>
<p><em>If you want to give Monster Hunter Outlanders a try,<a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/news-closed-beta-recruitment-is-open.html"> closed beta registration is now open</a> ahead of a test in mid-November.</em></p>

It seems Sega has managed to assemble a dynamic, colourful racer to rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> in many respects, a feat which was far from a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Yes, Sega was confident enough to directly reference Mario's all-conquering kart series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/sega-reignites-its-nintendo-rivalry-in-new-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer">in a cheeky trailer</a>, and everything seems peachy on other platforms. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-sonic-racing-crossworlds">Push Square</a> called it "a rock solid kart racer that carves its own path", and with the Switch <em>2</em> launch still planned for the holidays, it seems we've got another winner to look forward to.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rtisuw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p><em>But what about Switch 1?</em> you cry. <em>It's out now on Switch 1!</em></p>
<p>Well, unfortunately we don't know how the game holds up on the elder Switch just yet because we weren't able to get code prior to launch day. This is something that's only become more common over the previous generation, as Switch ports often arrive scorching hot at release. It's happened more than once with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/site-news-so-wheres-our-sonic-superstars-review">blue hedgehog</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/site-news-so-wheres-our-sonic-frontiers-review">games</a>, too.</p>
<p>Rest assured that we'll do our best to have our verdict on the Switch version live as soon as we can. Until then, let us know if you — <em>shock! horror!</em> — picked it up on Switch before reading our review, and how you've been getting on with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers, and as well as PC and Xbox, the game will also be coming to PS5.</p>

<p><em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>was unveiled during Xbox's spot at the Tokyo Game Show, so it feels particularly appropriate that the game will take players to Japan as its setting. The trailer shows off a number of Japanese accouterments, including a maneki-neko and a katakana license plate.</p>

<p>We didn't learn too much more about the game during the initial announcement, but we do know that after launching on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2026,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PlayStation 5. Whether it'll be available on Sony's console next year, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=NmC_VKte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=fZ7s6dvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>took us to Mexico,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will take place in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>game is just the latest in a string of Xbox titles to make their way to PlayStation; it follows the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>It's not just Xbox crossing the divide, though; Sony is also reciprocating (to a degree, at least), since popular live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II&nbsp;</em>was released for Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>'s launch.</p>

<h2>What else did Xbox reveal at Tokyo Game Show?</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>that Xbox showed off during its Tokyo Game Show spot. We also got to see what else the studio is up to, including new trailers for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>, and a first reveal for&nbsp;<em>Gungrave Gore Blood Heat</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gungrave-gore" rel="nofollow">the 2022 shooter</a>.</p>

<p>IO Interactive also revealed a brand new mission for&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination&nbsp;</em>during the show, and it'll star none other than legendary Chinese martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, whom you must protect as he infiltrates a high-stakes martial arts tournament.</p>

<p>Launching next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Just like clockwork, The Pokémon Company has revealed the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion, 'Deluxe Pack ex', and it's a blingy one.</p>
<p>The upcoming set will arrive in the app on <strong>29th September</strong>, and brings new 'Parallel Foil' cards to the table. These glistening offerings feature new art for pre-existing cards, and come with a unique shine effect to really make them pop.</p>
<p>The big news from this new set, however, is that rare cards from previous expansions are <em>guaranteed</em> with every pack. Each pack contains four cards, one of which will be a ♦♦♦♦ rarity card or higher from the Genetic Apex set through to Wisdom of Sea and Sky. So, if you're still chasing shinies from all those months ago, this might be your chance to nab 'em.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the Deluxe ex cards we've seen so far:</p>


<p>In addition to the new set, TPC has also confirmed that a bunch of in-app events will be heading our way next month. These include a Raichu ex Drop event on 6th October and a Parallel Foil Cards Mass Outbreak Event on the 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMxcCpkI44">Metal Gear Production Hotline presentation</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, we finally got a release date for the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which is due to arrive on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">multiplayer mode was first debuted back in June 2025</a>, ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta's launch this past August. Before its announcement, it wasn't clear if there would be a multiplayer mode in the remake like what was previously included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. When it was revealed, it became clear that the answer to that question was still no; there wasn't going to be a multiplayer mode like what players had in MGS3.</p>



<p>Fox Hunt is markedly different than the old multiplayer mode, a change that, per what Konami said when it was first revealed, came out of a desire to "<em></em><em>broadens the franchise’s core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Extended Look | Konami Press Start" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xGBiC4K9ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Granted, it doesn't look like it's a bad change. The mode seems like it'll take good advantage of the stealth mechanics available in Metal Gear Solid Delta. What's perhaps most unfortunate about the coming mode, is that just ahead of MGSD: Snake Eater's launch, Konami <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">confirmed it would not include support for crossplay.</a> </p>



<p>We'll see if that changes in the future, potentially if players continue to ask for it to be added. In the meantime, at least we have a date to look forward to for when we can all try out Fox Hunt.</p>



<p>In other Metal Gear Solid news, Konami put out a survey for Tokyo Game Show 2025 asking players <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">which MGS game they thing should get the remake treatment that MGS3 got with Delta</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and it is indeed the studio's first foray into cozy gaming, with closed beta signups available now if you want to get a chance to try it out.</p>

<p>We got our first glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>earlier this week when HoYoverse <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser" rel="nofollow">updated the game's socials</a>, and just as expected, a full reveal wasn't far behind. In a press release, the studio describes its new game as a "cosmic life simulation" that "blends the joy of creation, discovery, and community-oriented experiences".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, you'll nurture your very own planet, tending to its ecosystem and shaping it as you see fit. As you play, you'll form a galaxy "by connecting with different planets scattered across the starry sky".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=xwolBn44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=K-xQ9vCY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>represents HoYoverse's first foray into cozy gaming.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature a variety of the kinds of activities you'd probably expect from a cozy game, like fishing, mining, and cooking, as well as "beachcombing" and "harvest[ing] exotic crops".</p>

<p>It looks like you'll also be able to fill up your planet with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-style Neighbors, who will move in and populate your little corner of the galaxy. You can also build connections with these Neighbors and form relationships with them "through heartfelt conversations, thoughtful gift exchanges, and unique interactions".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to venture beyond your planet by visiting the Galactic Bazaar, described as "an ever-bustling social hub where conversations spark over coffee" and you can meet other players to forge friendships with them.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of what you can expect when HoYoverse's cozy game eventually lands on our planet.</p>




<p><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC and mobile devices, although HoYoverse says "additional platforms [are] currently in development". You can sign up for a chance to check out the closed beta <a href="https://planet.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <p>A former developer on massive Elder Scrolls mod project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> who called its current 2025 release goal "unachievable" has suggested March 2026 as a "fitting" release window for the task of remaking Oblivion in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine.</p>
<p>Around the time of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">mod's most recent showcase</a>, ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes put out a tweet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">accusing its project lead and implementation lead of rushing the mod out the door</a> to meet a 2025 release goal that Keyes dubbed "pointless and unachievable". The modder also accused the pair of mismanaging the project by not keeping up communication between leads and other developers in terms of key decisions. Keyes' claims and very public split from the Skyblivion team naturally led to questions being asked of the remaining Skyblivion devs, with the mod's comms lead telling fans: "Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking in an interview that'll be arriving in video form on RPS sister site Eurogamer's YouTube channel soon, long-time Skyblivion dev Keyes has now shared more about what he considers a reasonable release timeline for the mod, as well as his reasons for airing his concerns in the very public fashion he did. Asked what he'd consider a reasonable release goal for the mod in terms of avoiding crunch, Keyes said the following:  </p>
<blockquote>Whenever I wanted to delay, I wasn't even thinking of a year. I was thinking of a handful of months [extra]. Personally, I would love to see, this is just me wishing, but I would love to see March 2026 because that would make [it] the 20th anniversary of Oblivion. It'd be a nice fitting release date, I think. That would give an extra three months and that's like gold to us [developers]. So, I definitely feel like early 2026 would be nicer on the developers. But yeah, I'm on the outside now.</blockquote>
<p>Given the strength of the language Keyes used when dismissing 2025 as an ideal release goal, I'm a tad surprised he reckons a few more months would be all it'd take to polish Skyblivion to a satisfactory degree. That said, the dev had made clear he was only pushing for extra polishing time, rather than a longer delay that might lead to feature creep.</p><p>As for whether making the 2025 release goal was something that other Skyblivion devs were worried about, Keyes said: "I think it was definitely a concern a number of people had. Quite a few of them were leads as well, but I noticed that just for some reason, nobody was saying it. It was just more of like sort of a heavy feeling that was surrounding a lot of developers. And I'm always kind of the, for lack of a more elegant term, sometimes a bit of a shit stirrer. If nobody's saying anything, I'm going to try and get people to say something, because I hate miscommunication. It can ruin so many things."</p>
<p>In terms of corner cutting, the dev said his concerns stemmed from the idea that "if we're putting out assets or environments that don't even look as good as Oblivion, we're not living up to the whole point of the project".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Keyes dismissed the official Oblivion Remaster as a factor in any desire to make sure Skyblivion releases in 2025. On the other hand, he suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> is a release that could have consequences for Skyblivion, since it might lead to questions about starting from scratch in that game's engine. Though unless Bethesda suddenly push the big TES VI go button soon, odds are that won't be an issue - in 2023, Microsoft's Phil Spencer estimated that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-announced-five-years-ago-is-still-five-plus-years-away">the next numbered Elder Scrolls won't launch before 2028</a>.</p>
<p>Despite no longer being part of the mod's team, Keyes was also clear that he's hoping its release will go positively, whenever it comes. The modder said he hopes Skyblivion'll avoid major bugs at launch. "I do genuinely believe people are going to absolutely love what they're playing," he continued. "It's going to feel like a very unique thing they're playing because very rarely do you get to play something that's in production for this long. Not because of any development hell, but because they just wanted to take that amount of time to really focus on every detail."</p>
<p>We've reached out to the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>If indeed Keyes is right to claim that a lack of communication has plagued Skyblivion, here's hoping that its remaining devs can stay on the same page from here on out. The rest of us won't know how much time it ideally needed in the oven until we've got our hands on it, but with a volunteer project that's been in the works this long, I'm crossing my fingers that the modders produce a game that lives up to their own expectations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>What does it mean for a game to take your breath away? For me, it’s when what I’m being shown on screen makes me forget, no matter how briefly, to suck oxygen into my lungs or let the spent CO2 slowly exhale. The normal, mundane rhythms of my biology become interrupted in some way. For a moment or two I’m jarred out of the ordinary. This happens a lot in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>. To what end I’m still not sure. Sucker Punch Productions has outdone itself, but is all that beauty and artistry in service of yet another impressive Sony blockbuster of the type we’ve come to expect, or something more?</span></p> <p><span>I’ve ridden horseback through a number of fields, killed hundreds of foes, and spent an inordinate amount of time picking through the game’s open-world distractions, compelled by both pleasure and the irksome strain of obsessive completionism unique to games. Many of the things I’ve encountered in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>I’ve done or witnessed before, but the sheer craftsmanship with which they’re recreated leaves me struggling to turn away.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Set hundreds of years after the events of </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, the sequel follows wandering outlaw </span><span>Atsu as she returns to her homeland on the outskirts of Shogun rule looking for the Yotei Six, a group of ruthless killers who tortured her and murdered her family when she was still a child. Played by Erika Ishii, she makes for a much more grounded and compelling lead than </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s honor-bound aristocrat Jin Sakai.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628702" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628702"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628702">Sucker Punch Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where the original game was a war story, </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> is situated more like an American Western with Atsu and her wolf companion navigating a lawless frontier where samurai, raiders, and bounty hunters dish out competing forms of justice in a changing world. Nearing what I understand to be around the halfway point of the game (look for my full review closer to launch), </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> is already a much more strongly written and engrossing cinematic adventure than its predecessor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A tale of revenge might sound clichéd–will she outgrow her past trauma or be forever chained by it?–but a rich cast of multidimensional characters with their own motivations, struggles, and backstories keeps </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> from being </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> a violent campaign against those who wronged you. Atsu thinks killing the Yotei Six will revolve her past, when really it’s just another way of running from it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Combat feels much the same as that in the first game, but with new weapon types substituted in for particular schools of fighting. The highlight here are dual katanas that let Atsu cut enemies to pieces in the blink of an eye, but each tool is still governed by its effectiveness against particular enemy types. It’s fun and beautiful when everything comes together, but </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>still makes a number of trade-offs in service of the spectacle.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628705"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628705">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s not as fluid as the rhythmic juggling of</span><i><span> Spider-Man</span></i><span> or the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games and not as responsive and tightly tuned as more arcadey action games. The camera can still be a pain to manage as enemies nip at you from off-screen with arrows or unblockable attacks. This friction is meant to be overcome with new upgrades and skills, but boss fights especially still feel like cinematic events first, with the gameplay elements grafted onto them second.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where the breadth and visual splendor of </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>’s world comes in. Built from the ground-up for PS5 unlike the first game, there’s a whole new level of depth, detail, and polish in how Sucker Punch has rendered the wilderness of its Japanese setting. I’m constantly mesmerized by smoke lilting over trees and small villages in the distance, or how the wind lavishly frolics across a field of tall grass or yellow flowers. No screenshot or video clip and truly do it justice, even on the base PS5.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s also clear that a lot of effort has gone into masking the fact that this game leans heavily on the same kinds of repetitive tasks that other sandbox games openly taunt you with, cluttering their maps full of icons that threaten to induce burnout with their sheer volume and sameness. While gold birds still lure you to points of interest and you frequently encounter camps, fortresses, and other areas waiting to be “liberated” from surrounding factions, </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> tries very hard to make all of this stuff feel like it’s just unfolding naturally, rather than being just a scavenger hunt of perfunctory tasks to complete during lulls in the main story.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One big question for </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, and the trajectory of Sucker Punch’s games over the last two decades, is whether it wants to compete directly with the best open world adventures around like </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>. From where I currently sit, I’m not sure. At times its main story feels like it wants to be an action-packed interactive movie, a la </span><i><span>Uncharted</span></i><span>. At other times it’s lavishly trying to gamify mundane chores like cooking and bathing to make the world seem more realistic, natural, and immersive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The result is a lot of variety that keeps things fun but doesn’t always coalesce into something more. I’ve yet to encounter a side story that left me especially surprised or moved, or a particular stealth sequence, battle, or mini-game that made me desperate to find the next. </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei </span></i><span>does so many things at such a high bar of craft and quality but doesn’t always justify its particular mix of mechanics and gameplay concepts.&nbsp;</span><span>It can feel like </span><i><span>Westworld</span></i><span>: an immersive theme park of attractions still searching for the connective tissue that can turn it into something more. So far it feels like </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima </span></i><span>but more and better. </span></p> <p><span>Is that enough in 2025? Maybe. It’s still a massive achievement from a production standpoint. Many have tried and failed to turn out superb big-budget games with such predictability. But I’m still searching for the part that shows the core experience at the heart of </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> has leveled up just as much as each of its constituent parts. And with a game this pretty, I’m happy to keep looking. </span></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/farthest-frontier-understands-the-best-moments-of-city-builders-are-the-beginnings">I was really impressed by Farthest Frontier when I played it in early access a few years ago</a>, so much so, I've been keeping an eye out for the full release ever since. And we now finally know when it will be: 23rd October, which isn't far away at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/">Farthest Frontier is a city-building game</a> spun around the idea of a group of settlers heading into a wilderness in medieval times and establishing a settlement of their own there, growing it from a handful of huts and shacks into something resembling a town.</p>
<p>What's different about this game is how up-close the action is. You get to know settlers on a personal level, seeing details about who they are and what they're like, and the game delights in the minutiae of surviving in a period like this. For instance, you'll assign someone to fish and then have to build a little smokehouse nearby for them to smoke and preserve the fish in, but if you build the smokehouse too near people's houses, they'll complain about the smell, and rightly so. But if you don't smoke the fish, they'll go rotten in your stores.</p>

</figure>
<p>Expect to think a lot about crop rotations and farming, to think about water supplies and how to keep them clean and away from your town's organic waste, lest you spread disease. And to think about making sure everyone's wrapped up to survive the very present seasonal weather. (There are difficulty options to nudge the complexity down if you want.)</p><p>This zoomed-in approach brings a great deal of calm with it. This is a slow game about the aspects of day-to-day life we now take for granted - that are handled automatically for us - and it is very connected to nature and the land around your settlement. Bears can roam into your settlement and attack your people, brilliantly. Well, it's not brilliant for the people living there and getting mauled, but it's entertaining to watch. Generally, though, it's a very peaceful and gently absorbing game, full of forgotten intricacies of a time gone by.</p>

</figure>
<p>But enough about that! Farthest Frontier has been in early access for three years now, and the success it's enjoyed there - 1.2 million sales - has allowed developer Crate Entertainment to significantly beef-out the game. The 1.0 release will bring a significant amount of new content as well, including revamped progression, dozens of new building types, bridges (I hope there's some troubled water to cross), a new policy system, updated animations, and more.</p><p>Note that the game's selling price will increase when it launches, too, to reflect it being a fully rounded game. It will rise from $30 to $35 (the price here is currently £25, which I expect means it'll rise to £30 at launch). Those existing prices will dip again before launch in a Steam Autumn Sale, which begins 29th September. Potentially, there's a deal to be had.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159169/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I admit it. When this review came along, my gaming patience was being tested to its limit by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>’s brutal difficulty. So I rolled pretty enthusiastically towards an alternative I hoped would be more relaxing. (I genuinely regret the hours I spent defeating The Last Judge.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> seemed the ideal pellet-shaped breath mint to freshen things up. But while this ground-up remake will likely please fans of the 2002 original, it’s ironic that I found myself haunted by similar frustrations that I was experiencing elsewhere – including bosses that crossed the line from being challenging to becoming a bit of a chore. For newcomers more generally, you’ll have to decide whether the price point of £34.99 at launch fits your budget for what is, at its core, a six-to-seven-hour experience in a genre where there are so many other options.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159167/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let’s address the concerns of those primarily interested in the <em>quality</em> of this refresh. For the most part, the new additions are incredibly positive. The inclusion of a landing target as you jump — a circle that shows you where you’re heading and makes platforming pain-free — is extremely welcome and gets rid of some of the frustration a game with its heart in the early noughties might give its players.</p>
<p>The graphical upgrade impresses, too. This is no ‘sharper’ re-release like we’re getting elsewhere with certain galactic competitors. In comparison, the older version now looks a little primitive, with some garish shadows. Finally, Pac-Man and the inhabitants of Pac-Land have been brought to life in a way that more lives up to the franchise’s promise, longevity, and sense of fun. From the sun-drenched town that serves as the level hub (and gives access to retro-inspired challenge mazes), to the longer draw distances, everything looks good. Only some moments of retro game design — camera frustrations, mostly — undermine the overall impression.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159166/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance on Switch 2, except for two very brief stutters, is 30fps in 'Quality' 4K docked mode, or 60fps at 1080p (docked or handheld). I didn’t have the chance to play on the original Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-switch-and-switch-2-performance-and-resolution-detailed">but 30fps is the max there in any mode</a>. A word of caution, though: anyone planning to play this game on Switch Lite might find the presentation too small. I’m not sure it would be comfortable. The presentation here doesn’t suit small screens quite like other platformers.</p>
<p>This second ‘Re-Pac’ (the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pac-man_world_re-pac">Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</a> came out in 2022) has a decent amount of other new features. Now a second player can join in as a ‘Pac-Drone’ – ideal for a young child or anyone else happy to limit their gaming to shooting pellets at boxes and enemies. Changes to cut scenes and the level design also show up. The final boss, for example, is noticeably different to the original; the battle takes place in a slightly remixed arena with new enemies and attacks, and a more ambitious sheen to the presentation.</p>
<p>Then there are additions like the new mission mode. Here, the game asks you to fulfil three optional challenges on every stage, usually to pick up all the fruit (over 20 items – there’s a lot of fruit) and to achieve a medal on the time trial, plus one more random task.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159175/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For me, the levels were just too long to make going back and collecting such a high number of items actually fun, especially when the collectables reset every time you play, so there’s no chance of diving back in for a solitary melon or a strawberry. But there are scenarios (playing with your children, maybe) where the extra content will be appreciated, I’m sure. Gather all the collectibles and you’ll end up unlocking new mazes, costumes, and figurines to display around your home village.</p>
<p>During its stronger moments, Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac really is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the submarine and swimming levels. I enjoyed skating away from a giant snowball. I enjoyed all the moments when Pac-Man gulped down a giant pellet and turned into a chomping head, reminiscent of his classic games, and turned the tables on the otherwise invincible ghosts. I liked the sense of momentum and the surprise that the platforming was much more challenging than I expected (one famously difficult lava level used up over 20 lives). I had my work cut out for me at times, and that was fine.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159171/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At a lower price, I might recommend the game more readily, but even then I would still lean into framing the review as assessing a slice of gaming history that’s been refreshed and renovated, rather than a game that truly earns its place alongside contemporary heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. There’s no shame in that, but let’s be clear – at its heart this is a much better-looking and smoother-playing version of a 23-year-old game. This story of the demonic Spooky stealing all of Pac-Land’s golden fruit, and the short little adventure that ensues, is a little old-school.</p>
<p>And, via moments of cumbersome difficulty reminiscent of a game from 2002, that’s my cue to tie this review back to the opening, specifically my self-indulgent use of Silksong as a reference. Let me say that I was grossly mistaken: I might have thought I was escaping frustration by playing a colourful Pac-Man game – surely it would be easy, right? But boy was I wrong during the finale. And not necessarily in a ‘fair’ kind of way.</p>
<p>I’d already had a little trouble with one of the bosses in the middle of the game, where I fell off the arena multiple times via a camera quirk that a modern platformer wouldn’t allow. I felt the same kind of unfairness here, too. Principally with some jumps I had to make rapidly in order to damage the boss – they erred on the side of being frustrating more than challenging and came after a sequence of attacks that were difficult to avoid and left me with barely any life left.</p>
<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159176/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a yellow-tinged irony, this boss had more than a passing resemblance to the Last Judge – and here’s the thing, I literally couldn’t kill it. I could not complete this game.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I was doing wrong. After 30 attempts, dying every time, having to go through the three stages of the boss fight over and over again, losing all my lives, suffering eight Game Overs, switching in desperation to the kid-friendly ‘fairy mode’ (that makes you invincible), and somehow <em>still</em> failing to succeed (I made the sequence of jumps <em>once</em>, then died at the top by flying off the arena), I was thrown back to the very start once again.</p>
<p>And I just had to stop. Honestly, maybe it’s time to go back to Silksong.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don’t want to let my moan about the final boss overshadow the review. There’s still a fun game here, and a lovely remaster of a well-loved platformer. The things it does well — the personality of Pac-Man, friends, and enemies in the cut scenes, the variety in the gameplay — shine brightly. For those with nostalgia for the original, I’m sure you’ll enjoy your ‘Re-Pac’-aged version. It’s been made with love. For non-fans, however, this is a more difficult purchase to justify.</p>
<p>Arguably, the price is a little steep for what’s on offer, and some lingering retro-frustrations in the execution of the 3D platforming and boss fights might sit badly with an audience expecting a game with the finesse of more modern alternatives. Sure, even Donkey Kong Bananza has its share of cheap deaths, but the truth is Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac isn’t in the same league. Short, sweet, prettified, retro, and not for everybody; those are the keywords here.</p></section>

<p>The limited-time store will be opening on <strong>22nd October until 16th November 2025</strong> and it'll be located on the ground floor of the <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a> in Shepherd's Bush, opposite the LEGO Store.</p>
<p>Fans will be able to get their hands on lots of official merchandise, and there will be a handful of exclusive items available only at the London store.</p>
<p>Those who want to get in on the first week/weekend (22nd-26th October) will need to reserve a slot. Reservations will go live on <strong>7th October</strong>, and given how fast those temporary Pokémon Center stores, you might want to get in fast here, too.</p>
<p>After that, from 27th until closing day on 16th November, you won't need a reservation and instead a queueing system will be in place.</p>

<p>The store will be open from 10am - 9pm Monday through Saturday, and between 12pm - 6pm on Sundays.</p>
<p>Nintendo describes the pop-up as "the first-of-its-kind shopping centre-based Nintendo store in Europe." If only we could get a permanent one...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, and this one works a little differently to the others.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion is coming on September 29th, and unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">expansions</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack" rel="nofollow">booster packs</a>, it looks like you won't find any brand new cards contained within this one.</p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>will introduce new booster packs that are guaranteed to contain one card from previous expansions (<em>Genetic Apex&nbsp;</em>through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>) with a four-diamond rarity rating or higher.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to being able to "collect 'parallel foil' cards with a unique shine effect", according to The Pokemon Company, as well as a new Raichu ex drop event that will occur during the period in which&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>That's right: this isn't a permanent expansion. The Pokemon Company says you'll be able to grab packs from&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>until October 30th, at which point they'll be removed. However, the trailer does promise that these packs will be available again at some point in the future.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion right here. It shows off some of the new art for existing cards, as well as some gorgeous ex designs.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion comes after The Pokemon Company promised Mega Evolution would make its way to the mobile card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">sometime this fall</a>; presumably, it'll be part of the next expansion set after&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>launches on September 29th and runs until October 30th. You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

            <p>Firaxis and 2K Games are working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update that revamps the game's map generation, while adding a couple of city states and rounding out Napoleon's skillset. It's <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/update-1-2-5-is-loading.699971/">slated to land sometime in the week of September 29th</a>. Why am I writing about it right now? Because senior graphics engineer Ken Pruiksma has just posted a little blog about the intricacies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> map generation that caused Beethoven's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kcOpyM9cBg">Ode To Joy</a> to play tinnily in my head.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a reflection of emotional diarrhea brought on by minor insomnia brought on by a nagging foot injury. Still, there's something... uplifting about the motions of plate tectonics as approximated by computer code. Perhaps you, kind stranger, will be similarly moved.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"When Civilization VII first shipped, the map generation technique we used focused on ensuring balanced play while following some new gameplay rules around things like Deep Ocean and Distant Lands," Pruiksma explains on <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/map-generation/">the game's official site</a>. "This technique, which has its roots in previous Civ games, created fair maps, but also made them predictable." 
</p>
<p>That predictability led to complaints of repetitiveness during Civ 7's exploration phase. Players are also unhappy about "the straight-edged coastlines that could occur between the two major halves" of each map, as Pruiksma goes on. Firaxis are trying to address that in update 1.2.5 with two new map types - "Continents and Islands (two large continents, with islands) and Pangea and Islands (one large continent, with islands)". Both these map types use Voronoi diagrams to grow their landmasses, rather than fractal noise.
</p><p>Being a clueless humanities grad, I won't try to explain Voronoi diagrams - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Wikipedia page</a> calls them "a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects". I'm not qualified to walk you through "fractal noise", either, other than to theatrically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">repeat</a> that it "sounds like a waterfall". Thankfully, Pruiksma jumps straight to explaining the impact of these unsettling math demons on Civilization map generation. 
</p>
<p>Fractal noise, he notes, "works really well when it can be applied uniformly to the whole map. That said, it can be hard to steer towards specific gameplay needs. Voronoi diagrams, on the other hand, give us structure we can build rules on top of, so maps can stay organic while still meeting the gameplay requirements of Civ VII." 
</p>
<p>Now, here's the walkthrough of how the new generator operates that had me hallucinating Beethoven. If you're not into Beethoven, maybe play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTJjQj6PkrY">this track from Gorillaz album Demon Days</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Randomly spray a bunch of points onto the map. The more points we spray, the higher the resolution. We'll start low res.</li>
<li>Draw lines around each point dividing them into "cells." You end up with something that looks a bit like cracked glass.</li>
<li>Select some starting cells. These are the seeds of tectonic plates in the game map, similar to the tectonic plates that form our Earth.</li>
<li>Each plate grows, one cell at a time, following some configurable rules, until the whole map is filled. Each plate gets a rotation and movement direction. This is your map's crust, and will be used to help influence the growth of continents later.</li>
<li>Now spray many more dots for a higher resolution version! Draw those lines again to get another shattered-glass look sitting on top of your tectonic plates.</li>
<li>Choose some new starting points for the primary landmasses, and grow them once again following a custom set of configurable rules. These rules can do things like influence landmasses to grow along plate boundaries (especially if they're colliding), avoid the poles, and prefer certain latitudes, just to name a few. This is also where we can apply gameplay-based restrictions, like ensuring Homelands and Distant Lands are separated by a Deep Ocean.</li>
<li>Based on the map's settings, we then grow islands, erode the coastline, add mountains and volcanoes, and perform other finishing touches. Many of these steps involve the same set of generic rules used earlier to determine where features are placed.</li>
<li>Once finished, we overlay the hex grid and then hand the map off to the gameplay layer to determine tile types, Yields, Resources, starting location, and more.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful! I think it's wonderful? I wish devs posted this stuff more often. Ah, remember when "generation" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">used to be a happy, magic word</a>, rather than the harbinger of cost-cutting. 
</p>
<p>We've only got his word for it, but Pruiksma says that the new Voronoi-derived maps appear "far more varied and look much more natural", with oddities or "impossible" features appearing more regularly, such as chains of islands between Homelands and Distant Lands.
</p><p>The tuning of the new generator is designed to produce "natural-feeling maps with standard gameplay" about "95% of the time", he comments, so every 1 in 20 games you might encounter something totally bizarre. If you're concerned about broken terrain, especially in multiplayer games, you'll still be able to play the old map types and generation processes after update 1.2.5.
</p>
<p>Do you have a favourite map or terrain generator in a game of any genre? I have fond memories of certain pre-acquisition eras of Minecraft, when the invisible sandworms hired by Mojang to sculpt the geography would produce huge surface-level caves and giddy rock bridges a couple of pickaxe swings away from being floating islands.
</p><p>
Also yes, regulars who know who they are - this is your cue to once again recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>'s <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/forums/community-patch-project.497/">Vox Populi mod</a> as a vastly superior alternative to Civilization 7, which continues to divide players. I'm not avoiding writing about that mod, I'm just short of time. I never have enough time!</p>
