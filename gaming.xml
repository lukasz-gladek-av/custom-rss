            <p>
I've been excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roman-sands-rebuild">Roman Sands RE:Build</a> since the moment I laid my eyes on it, particularly because it's from the same studio behind the ever-haunting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>. Roman Sands just has a ridiculously strong art direction to it, very much one that could easily be dubbed Y2K, but I think more accurately should be seen as an evolution of the aesthetic/ era. Almost as if this is the direction it could have gone in. 
</p>

<p>
Just great stuff, not even counting the oddball gameplay, and as revealed in a new trailer, it's got a release date now too: September 12th. That's close enough for me to count down the days, but far away enough for me to think "I'd like to be playing this right now actually, ta very much." The trailer offered a new look at its strange, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> hotel and all of its guests, as well as a tease for the things you'll be getting up to (all of which seem quite ominous.

<p>
The gameplay itself sees you attending to the demands of said guests as outlandish as they all are, but the clock is working against you. Specifically, a clock that'll see the sun swallowing up the world. Terrifying! And a great hook. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231460/Roman_Sands_REBuild/">There's a demo you can check out on Steam too</a>, or you can just wishlist it if you want to wait for the full thing.
</p>
<p>
Excitingly, the release date trailer also had a mysterious tease for Paratopic: Overdub, seemingly an anniversary edition of the game. Over on its <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/edit/news/2346939?tab=compose">Steam page</a> it's described as a remaster/ remix/ sequel, and look, it could be none of those things and I'd still be in. Paratopic is a peak example of the modern trend of PS1-inspired games, using the aesthetic to really hone in on its subtle horrors. Whatever this new thing contains, I'll take it. It's coming September 12th too, so I'm sure like me you'll be plenty busy that day!

            <p>
Now, I'm not naming any names here, but there's a certain hand-drawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> that everyone's a bit sick of waiting for by this point, and could really do with a release date. OK, fine, yes it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and if those recent Steam backend updates mean anything, I expect it'll get some kind of update sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/constance">Constance</a>, also a hand-drawn metroidvania, that actually does have a release date.
</p>

<p>
In Constance, you play as a purple-haired painter who is "striving to escape from a colorful but decaying inner-world, created by her declining mental health." Mental health themes are nothing new in the world of indie games, but that's not what really sells me on Constance. That'd be the tight-looking platforming and snappy, paint-brush oriented combat.

<p>
You literally fight and hop dart around with a massive paintbrush, using it to do pretty much everything, from glooping up the side of a wall, to doing quick brush strokes that let you dodge. Occasionally you'll even have to do some actual painting, if you can believe it! The thing looks lovely too, I'm a sucker for hand-drawn games, as they always feel like labours of love. Aesthetically that certainly seems to be the case here, so I'm hoping the full release lives up to its look. There's a demo to available too, so you and I could always give that a go to find out!
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, release date! That'll be November 24th, a few months away still, but I'm sure you can wait. As I said, I really wouldn't be surprised if Silksong does get dated this weekend, but definitely consider keeping Constance on your radar too, I'm sure more than enough people are going to pick up the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel. You can wishlist Constance on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">here</a>.

<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156590/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to put your Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no shortage of options in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">its generous launch lineup</a>. Whether it’s the candy-colored charm of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or the neon-drenched cityscape of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, you’re spoiled for choice when it comes to visual powerhouses.</p>
<p>With such major titles on offer, it would be easy to overlook <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. Released on other platforms in July 2024, it’s a game that, at first glance, might seem like just another Japanese action game, complete with unwieldy title and familiar feudal-era setting. Jumping into the adventure of the goddess Yoshiro and her faithful protector Soh, I was surprised to find that Capcom’s Shinto-inspired epic is a truly compelling blend of action and tower defence.</p>
<p>The land has been overrun by a demonic force known as the Seethe. Villages surrounding the sacred Mount Kafuku have fallen to corruption. Yoshiro, a divine being, must perform a ritual dance to cleanse each area. Cleansing leaves her vulnerable to attack, which is where her bodyguard Soh comes in. He is tasked with defending the goddess as they move through each settlement, dancing away the evil. Thankfully, Soh won't be alone in this task.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156595/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In each area, you cleanse corrupted villagers and assign them combat roles, allowing them to join your fight. You’ll place these villagers in strategic positions around Yoshiro. As night falls, your group must hold their ground against waves of Seethe. The day-night cycle creates a natural ebb and flow of action. During the day, you free villagers, collect crystals, and purge corrupted fauna while a timer counts down to nightfall. Roles are assigned to your fighters using crystals, but this currency is primarily used to carve a path for the ritual. As Soh waves his harai gushi to guide Yoshiro, her progress will determine how many cycles it will take to clear the area. Some will take a single day, most take multiple.</p>
<p>Half ARPG, half tower defence, Kunitsu-Gami is a fascinating and addictive mashup. You control Soh directly, and there’s a beautiful fluidity to his combat. His “blade dance” has a slight delay between input and impact, giving the sensation of gliding through swathes of enemies and cutting them to ribbons. He can attach multiple talismans and tsuba to his gear, which add devastating new abilities or boosts to villagers.</p>
<p>After a settlement is cleared, it becomes a base that you can revisit between rituals. Upgrading these bases provides rewards for both Soh and his growing band of fighters.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156594/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Between villages, powerful bosses await, and defeating them earns you a mask that unlocks a new role type to assign to villagers. Boss fights themselves play like a gritty, horror-tinged version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>, as you command fighters to swarm an enemy or defend Yoshiro from adds.</p>
<p>Each villager role has unique utility, from the humble woodcutter to the formidable sorcerer. Selecting the right roles for the right type of enemy or environment is key to Yoshiro’s survival.</p>
<p>The settlements of Mount Kafuku are visually stunning, vibrant dioramas that shift from fleshy hellscape to lush paradise as Yoshiro does their thing. The game runs incredibly well too; Soh slices shafts of bright colour through large groups of enemies without any noticeable frame drops. Performance remains impressive undocked, with the Switch 2’s larger display complementing the top-down environments perfectly. There’s also a healthy selection of visual options (being able to disable motion blur and depth of field is appreciated, Capcom) and accessibility tweaks.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Completing the audio-visual feast is an intoxicating soundscape, which is only slightly marred by a woeful English voice track. Luckily the option to swap to Japanese is available.</p>
<p>Mouse control will be a bit divisive for some. Arguably, this kind of title is well suited to the mouse, as a large chunk of gameplay has you assigning units in the command menu. It took some getting used to, but once I found a comfortable hand position, I enjoyed playing this way. Ultimately, though, I found myself retreating to traditional controls during difficult sections like boss fights. Manoeuvring Soh around enemies while shifting the camera with mouse movement just didn't quite work for me.</p>
<p>Still, even without the extra ways to play that Switch 2 offers, this is a great representation of multiple genres in its own right. It’s a generous title, with plenty of reasons to go back to levels, revealing secrets and unlocking more abilities for Soh and his army.</p>
<figure><a title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156587/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While each villager role introduces a new strategy and each corrupted settlement adds fresh mechanics, the formula does start to feel slightly repetitive after the midpoint. That said, the core loop of upgrade-plan-defend is addictive and makes Kunitsu-Gami one of the most unique launch titles on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p></section>

Think of a haunted toy box belonging to a deranged puppeteer, and then add a bit of glam rock for good measure. It's the perfect vibe for the story of a sailor with no memories setting out to find a cursed location, and the adventure will arrive on PC and mobile in 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our creative journey began with a spark of pure feeling—an emotional image that guided everything: 'If a puppet’s mind is soaked in water, memories slip away into the ocean, yet they still choose to return and sail again.' This early inspiration was both a playful nod to the Chinese saying “ 脑子进水” ('brain soaked with water') and a philosophical reflection seen in some of our favorite films," Joker Studios told us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When it came time to build the actual framework, we drew on a wide range of influences—from JRPGs and CRPGs to open-world titles and even niche indie games that share a spirit of boundless exploration. At every step, we focused on how to let players experience these feelings themselves, not just watch them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you dive into Sea of Remnants you'll be focused on exploring the pirate city Orbtopia, talking to the rich cast of NPCs and - you're a sailor after all -  taking to the briny waves to find islands, treasures, and hidden ruins. You can raid the ships you meet on the sea or take on huge monsters, all while a dynamic weather system rages overhead. When you're not doing that you'll be focused on upgrading your vessel, learning new skills, or even kicking back with some fishing, cooking, and mahjong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You’ll challenge sea monsters, explore local cultures, and sense the deeper mystery of how memory and forgetting begin to intertwine between the ocean and Orbtopia, the pirate haven. Alongside your companions, you’ll begin a journey that’s equal parts unrestrained and romantic, charting a course as unique as each sailor who steps aboard," says Joker Studio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joker Studio previously released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/identity-v"><u>Identity V</u></a>, a survival horror game created in partnership with Dead by Daylight's Behavior Interactive. Since its release in 2018, Identity V has collaborated with Edward Scissorhands, Sherlock Holmes, Personae and Deathnote. Just like Sea of Remnants it has a distinctive visual style - think Coraline but creepier. The game made a bigger impact in Asia than the US, but it still has a dedicated fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At their core, the two games exist in entirely separate worlds and storylines.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-toem-2-hands-on-back-behind-the-lens/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With its first gameplay reveal during this year's Day of the Devs, indie developer Something We Made finally showed off the sequel to their inaugural title TOEM: A Photo Adventure from 2021. This charming photography adventure brought an easygoing monochrome adventure to hundreds of fans and left us wanting more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>TOEM 2 opens with the same plucky character from the first title dropped into the world with little more than ambition and a trusty camera. While the first game focused on ascending the TOEM mountain, I didn't catch nary a whiff of the actual motivations and reasoning for the journey this time around. Instead, I was given free reign to meander around the idyllic village and solve a variety of problems for the townsfolk, from trying to retrieve a potion of liquid courage for a scaredy-cat knight to taking photos of three goats in order to permit a bridge troll to let me pass. In my twenty or so minutes of play, I was able to help solve the small-scale problems of four individuals and be rewarded with a stamp for my collection each time.</p>
<p>The camera remains the player's best tool in the world of TOEM 2 with players not only able to use their photography skills to solve the plights of the ordinary person, but also a variety of attachments to use as tools in your adventure. The very first unlockable upgrade I earned for my camera was a hammer upgrade that let me smash through select stone blocks that hindered my progression. Using the hammer is just like the other attachments from the first TOEM: simply point and shoot (or in this case, tap on the rocks). It took a moment to realize that there's a small minigame to using the hammer with players having to tap out morse code with short and long taps in order to break those rocks.</p>
<figure>

<p>One puzzle I encountered was take a 3x3 cube of blocks and chisel away to make a matching sculpture to the quest giver. Rather than trying to memorize the layout or run back and forth between the source sculpture and what I was crafting, I stopped to take photos of each side of the cube and use those to remember the requested shape. The developers from Something We Made seemed surprised that this was a valid solution to their puzzle and it was nice to see the camera being used as a note taking device as well as the tool you'll use to take pictures of every animal around the landscape.</p>
<p>New to TOEM 2 is also the addition of jumping, and in true platformer style, I had to test it out by jumping around on top of any short wall I could find and try to scale up the world. I couldn't find any unintended out-of-bounds areas, but I was at least able to find some climbable areas that would lead to new hats for the playable character. With jumping now on the menu, I wouldn't be surprised if the Honk attachment gets phased out for TOEM 2.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's still a fair bit of time before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/">TOEM 2</a> is ready to be in players' hands. Developer Something We Made and publisher popagenda have penciled in this quaint photographical adventure for 2026 across a slew of unannounced consoles as well as PC.</p>

            <p>
I don't think you can more easily sell me on a game than by saying it was made by one of the artists behind Celeste, and has music from Disasterpeace, i.e. the composer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, and It Follows. But that's exactly what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverway">Neverway</a> is, a horror RPG in the vein of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/neverway-is-a-horror-rpg-stardew-valley-from-one-of-the-artists-behind-celeste">first announced back in April</a>, back with a nice little look-in at yesterday's Day of the Devs presentation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pedro Medeiros, the Celeste artist in question, and programmer/ writer Isadora Sophia gave a great little rundown of Neverway, explaining that you play as Fiona, a character who much like the player character in Stardew has just quit her dead end job. She's trying to start over on a farm, live the quiet life, except she ends up having to serve as a herald for a dead god because of some debt she owes. Awkward!

<p>
That kind of life does end up leading towards the need to fight in a classic Zelda-ish 2D action combat kind of way, but you do have to balance all of that adventuring with your regular life too. That means farming, paying your mortgage, making friends, maybe even falling in love. Those bonds can lead to new combat abilities too, something I wish my own relationships offered me. 
</p>
<p>
Time works a bit differently in Neverway too, as rather than the day slowly tick tocking away, it moves from morning, to afternoon, to night when you do things like eat, sleep, or read a manual of some sort.
</p>
<p>
After a while, you'll end up searching for the titular Neverway, a "decaying nightmarish reality that is slowly leaking into yours." This is where you'll learn about the game's post-apocalyptic world as you pay off your debt.
</p>
<p>
I know "farming sim but dark" isn't exactly a new concept, it's just that Neverway is doing so with such eyecatching style I can't help but be won over by it. It looks like there's a real sincerity to the life-sim elements as opposed to them just being slapped into some dark themes. That's the ticket to my heart honestly, a good bit of earnestness goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
Neverway doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

Happily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, players were able to stop the station's deadly space laser from obliterating the game's map — although not without causing a bit of damage in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As destruction rained down, the event's closing moments saw Superman arrive — presumably to try and help with clean up duties during the game's incoming superhero-themed season, which begins in just a few hours' time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's big Star Wars event began in orbit around the game's battle royale Island, giving players a rare glimpse at the game's setting from outside its usual boundaries. Fortnite's setting exists as a bubble of reality floating through the multiverse (which handily allows any character from any franchise to turn up at any time!) and here, players were able to pilot X-Wings and TIE-Fighters to blow up orbiting Star Destroyers and engage in fun dogfights. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">continued absence of a Star Wars: Battlefront 3</a>, this was a fun riff on its space battles to get things started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action then swiftly moved to within the Death Star itself, as Fortnite heroes Jonesy (Troy Baker) and Hope (Suzie Yeung) led players through the bowels of the station, initially disguised as Stormtroopers and their captives. Ultimately, players found themselves in an encounter with Star Wars' Emperor (was that the voice of Sheev Palpatine himself, Ian McDiarmid?), and able to escape the Death Star as it exploded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/0defa510-26bf-45aa-835e-6c50e905e524-1-1749324031249.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Battlefront eat your heart out.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a nod to Fortnite's 2021 live event Operation Sky Fire (which also ended in a space station exploding above the game's Island), players were initially left to celebrate their victory — until the realisation that huge flaming chunks of said space station were now raining down on their battle royale home. And here, one of these chunks smashed straight into the glowing Rift Gate used to access the spirit realm by Fortnite's current antihero Daigo, unleashing its untold power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event's final moments see players back on the Island, mysterious energy now crackling around them. (Will this be the explanation for why superpowers now exist in the next battle royale season? Quite possibly.) Meanwhile, Superman is seen watching the Island from afar, as it is flooded by spirit realm energy. The suggestion here, of course, is that Superman will be swooping in to help.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/696-fortnite-death-star-sabotage-full-event-experience-00-14-22-1749324356071.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Superman watches as Fortnite's battle royale Island erupts in spirit realm energy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite will, for the first time, follow up a major live event with a new season launch on the same day. Following the conclusion of Death Star Sabotage, Fortnite is currently in downtime, but will return with Chapter 6: Season 3 in just a few hours' time. As you might expect from Superman's arrival, this next season will indeed be superhero themed — and as eagle-eyed players have noticed, this is indeed the new version played by David Corenswet from James Gunn's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> movie. That's some well-timed brand synergy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While highly anticiapated, Fortnite's Star Wars season saw some of the game's lowest player numbers in some time — perhaps in response to its daring decision to remove all regular weapons (and all ammo!) and fully commit to a five-week period of Star Wars gunplay. It will be interesting to see how player numbers rebound with the launch of this new season later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Fortnite developer Epic Games announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-darth-vader-was-the-beginning-epic-reveals-plans-to-let-people-create-their-own-ai-npcs-in-fortnite">making Star Wars in-game assets available to creators to build their own experiences in a galaxy far, far away</a> in the not too far off future. While enjoyable, tonight's live event did feel at some points like something of a showcase for that, while including a few morsels for fans of the game's ongoing narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to watch the whole of Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage for yourself? You can find a recording of the full live event mission below, or Epic Games has a 4K quality version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJ2z07dpoc&amp;ab_channel=Fortnite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite x Star Wars: Galactic Battle Death Star Sabotage Event <a href="https://t.co/3EeBvjVmpI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3EeBvjVmpI</a></p>— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931417911190491429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A. Corey novels and Syfy TV adaptations. It's an original story that casts you as a Pinkwater Security mercenary, who starts out trapped on Eros Station - an asteroid base that undergoes cataclysmic upheaval in the TV show - and later takes charge of an advanced starship, so as to quest around the solar system. The game is inspired by BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series, with "tactical" third-person combat featuring two ally characters and cover mechanics. Also, crew romances. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In a press release, game design producer Yuliya Chernenko comments that "the original Mass Effect trilogy was absolutely an inspiration to the team", being "iconic for the Xbox 360 generation of gamers". I was going to get snobby about that nod to consoles, but then I realised that the sentence is a sick burn on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, so we'll call it square.</p>
<p>Its 360 thinking aside, Osiris Reborn's combat "reflects the standards of modern action gameplay". I'm unconvinced of Owlcat's ability to develop a real-time Mass Effect-style squad action experience, but they've got ample prior for the kinds of crew relationship dynamics and political tensions you find in both Mass Effect and The Expanse.</p>
<p>Please take shelter behind the nearest knee-high surface while I pepper your position with these bulletpoint features, according to what I hope is a faithful simulation of zero-G physics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create Your Own Captain: Play as an Earther, Martian, or Belter and take command of the system's most advanced ship. Shape your journey through identity, leadership, and the pressure of survival.</p>
<p>Lead a Crew: Your companions are more than squadmates -- they have pasts, motives, and a voice in your story. Your leadership decisions will determine how squadmate loyalty shifts under pressure.</p>
<p>Tactical Third-Person Combat: Implement real-time strategic cover mechanics using various abilities and squad coordination. Bring two companions into combat while others support from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Explore a Divided Solar System: Travel across iconic locations from the TV show and books, like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. While traversing the various environments, players must uncover secrets and influence outcomes through their skills and decisions.</p>
<p>A Story-Driven RPG True to The Expanse: Immerse yourself in a narrative grounded in tension, consequence, and the complexity of humanity's future among the stars</p></blockquote>
<p>Osiris Reborn is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727390/The_Expanse_Osiris_Reborn/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-736f65">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_expanse_osiris_reborn">GOG</a> at a date that is not today, nor tomorrow, but "soon".</p>
<p>The developers are at pains to reassure that they've got a whole new team working on the thing and that there is no overlap with any of Owlcat's other projects, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-is-the-next-tactical-and-bloody-crpg-from-the-devs-behind-rogue-trader">the recently revealed Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>. They're collaborating on the game with Alcon Interactive Group, publishers of The Expanse: A Telltale Story.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-971806"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Owlcat Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</em> is a third-person action RPG set in <em>The Expanse</em> universe. You’re no hero—just a merc caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, trying to hold your crew together and keep the ship up and running. Your choices will shape your story.</p><p><strong>The Universe Never Told Us if We Did Right or Wrong</strong></p><p>By the 24th century, humanity has conquered the cosmos. However, life has remained anything but easy. In The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, a story-driven sci-fi Action RPG, you play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Create and customize your own captain—Earther, Martian, or Belter—and lead a crew of highly-skilled specialists as you face off against escalating threats, political pressure, and a relentless enemy that will stop at nothing to see you dead. In a solar system held together by fragile alliances, every decision leaves its mark.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_971804"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Trust Isn’t Given—It’s Earned</strong></p><p>Your companions are more than just mission assets—they are people with their own scars and loyalties. Some chase redemption. Others hide their truths. Over time, your relationships will flourish or deteriorate depending on the choices you make and how you choose to lead. The ship becomes your home—a place where trust is earned, not given.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Third-Person Combat</strong></p><p>Fight in third-person utilizing cover-focused gunplay and abilities. Two companions will accompany you into the field while others will support from a distance: disabling systems or drawing the enemies’ attention. You will issue real-time commands and have to adapt quickly to survive the manifold threats the system will throw at you.</p><p><strong>The Fractured World of The Expanse</strong></p><p>Visit iconic locations like Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. Walk through ruined habitats and political strongholds mired in unease and tension. Talk to the locals. Uncover secrets. Use your skills to influence what happens next. The system looks different from every planet and from every asteroid. Some are falling apart. Others just hide it better. You may even come across a familiar face or voice that reminds you of just how small the system really is.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

With a pair of games in the early 2010s, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/04/02/weview-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed/">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a> had great circuits, a fun and eye-catching vehicle transformation system, and a huge roster drawn from more than just the Sonic universe. Those vehicle transformations are making a comeback in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and it’s easy to argue that Sonic’s erstwhile rival Mario actually cribbed from his homework, with Mario Kart now also having transforming vehicles and a quirkier line up of characters.</p>
<p>But where Mario’s just gone open world, Sonic’s now going inter-dimensional, or maybe intergalactic?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds –&nbsp;Now we're racing with portals!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tILNuCTkEKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the big hook for CrossWorlds. The karting will feel pretty immediately familiar, slotting right into the genre staple elements and tropes, while the tracks will bounce back and forth between driving on roads, powering across water, and flying through the air, but everything changes after the first lap. At that point, the race leader is able to choose between two portals, deciding which CrossWorlds stage you’ll be teleported to for the second of the three laps. Through a four race championship, the final round will be one lap each of the first three race tracks, teleporting you between them instantly.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, and the CrossWorlds are a potential wildcard that the leader can use to play to their own strengths, though when there’s 24 tracks and 15 CrossWorlds stages, they could quickly become the part of the game you know best, especially if players online start to gravitate towards a particular one or two.</p>


<p>This also puts another bit of pressure on for the light collectathon angle. Each track has got five red stars to collect, in amongst the long strings of rings, of course. It’s a bit like collecting letters or other pickups in a platformer, except that you’re also trying to win the race, and you really only have the first and third laps in order to grab them.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of other intriguing twists to the kart racing formula from Team Sonic. It starts at, well, at the start of the race, where the way you get a boost is much more like a sim racing game’s need to get the revs just right. That kind of approach can also be seen when drifting, where a drift bar fills up repeatedly to very clearly demonstrate how much of a boost you’ll get when you come out of it.</p>
<p>If those a shade of more realistic racers, then the air tricking is right out of the arcade extreme sports playbook. As you’re going through the air on a big jump, you can flick and flip your car around pulling over-the-top tricks to build up a boost… but make sure not to hit the ground again while tricking or all that effort will go to waste. This combined with the handling in general, not to mention that clear blue sky Sega aesthetic, really does make Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds feel like a classic arcade racer.</p>

<p>But you wouldn’t get something like the Gadget Plate at the arcades. You simply wouldn’t have time to make use of this degree of customisation before you run out of coins to feed the machine!</p>
<p>Dished out by the mustachio’d cat in a hover car, Dondon Pa, Gadget Plates let you equip a whole bunch of car-modifying Gadgets. A plate has got two rows of three slots which you can fill up how you see fit, with gadgets taking up a number of slots and then modifying everything from the vehicle speed and acceleration, to letting you carry three items, doubling boost, increasing the chances of particular item types, and making certain items more powerful.</p>
<p>If you expect to win on skill and speed, the vehicle mods would be the order of the day with a bump to defensive item odds, but someone that likes to race in the thick of it would get much more out of boosting attack item chances, a giant rocket punch mode, and a quicker recovery. You can set up multiple gadget loadouts and switch out the plates between races as well, which will let you switch up some of how you race.</p>

<p>There’s some neat ideas in Sonic Racing CrossWorlds that bring a real arcade feel to the genre in a way that maybe only Sonic could.</p>

The Emperor has been defeated, the Empire has been run off the Fortnite island yet again, and after five short weeks of Star Wars mayhem, it's time for Fortnite to move on to its summer season, which has only just slightly been officially revealed--more on that in a moment.</p><p>Star Wars season was an unorthodox one for Epic Games, which had never dropped a season quite like this one before--past mini seasons were throwbacks, rather than full-throated collaboration events, though last year's Remix season blurred that line. But now that it's over, Fortnite is going back to a more standard season for the summer. And we won't have long to wait for it to get started.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start time</h2><p>Every previous time that a Fortnite season ended with a live event on a Saturday, the game went offline until at least Sunday morning. But this time, it seems as though Season 3 will instead be launching <em>tonight</em>.</p><p>Players who completed the Death Star Sabotage event were greeted with a timer counting down to the start of the new season--but it said it would start in less than six hours. The timer is counting down to 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on Saturday evening. That doesn't necessarily guarantee that it actually will be back online then, since maintenance downtime length can be unpredictable, but clearly that is what Epic Games is aiming for.</p><p>Given that, you can expect Fortnite to be back online <strong>sometime during the evening after 5 PM PT on Saturday.</strong></p><p>We've already gotten details on what to expect, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">what's new in Season 3</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6652/" data-ref-id="2900-6652">Season 3 battle pass</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6651/" data-ref-id="2900-6651">map changes</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-chapter-6-season-3-super-all-guns-hero-items-and-loot/2900-6650/" data-ref-id="2900-6650">new weapons</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-a-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025.1211277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At SGF this year, TechRaptor got a chance to check out the upcoming SGF demo for <em>Frosthaven</em>, a digital adaptation of 2022's hit strategy game. This faithful recreation of the board game presents a 'no mess' version of an incredible (and difficult) board game with deep legacy mechanics as you not only explore the world and develop your characters, but build up the settlement of <em>Frosthaven </em>to offer more gameplay opportunities and build up defences.</p>

<p>Before getting my hands on the game, I was lucky enough to not only speak with Hristo Petkov, the game director for <em>Frosthaven</em>, as well as Isaac Childres, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" rel="nofollow">designer behind the <em>Frosthaven </em>board game</a>.</p>

<h2>Adapting <em>Frosthaven </em>From The Board To The Screen</h2>

<p>Knowing that <em>Gloomhaven</em>, the previous game in the 'Haven' series, had already been adapted into a Video Game, I asked what it was like adding on additional elements to suit <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>In praise of Childres and the new mechanics that were created, he said, "Each character has a very individual playstyle and mechanics, so we needed to actually change quite a lot from Gloomhaven."</p>

<p>The largest addition that had to be created was the Outpost phase. This is the part of the game in between the combat missions where you can "create buildings, craft potions, and so on. You also need to defend it from attackers that approach the city."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=DSb1iGft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=niup-9WX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a legacy game, <em>Frosthaven </em>iterates from session to session as you and your friends develop their characters and build out the town. I was excited to hear that even if you're playing a game with friends, if one friend isn't able to make it, the game adapts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Let's say you have a four-person party and one of the guys cannot come today. You can still play with or without their character for a couple of missions, and he can come back after. It's not a problem, just like the board gam,e it's very adaptable in terms of the number of players."</p>

<p>It was highlighted that even in a scenario where one player ends up at a lower level than the rest of the players, then the game will adjust to the average level of the party.</p>

<p>I turned to Childres to ask if he'd considered a digital edition of <em>Frosthaven </em>while developing it, and he commented that he had only been focusing on making the board game. "Once it was made Twin Sales, who was the original publisher, approached us and asked, 'Do you want to do this one digital too?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?'"</p>

<p>Talking about the collaboration, I wanted to get a better idea of what it looked like as development continued and how it made sure to stay true to Childres' vision. Childres explained, "we have monthly meetings where they show me all the new assets and I'm like 'Oh, it looks awesome!'" while knowing he was easy to be pleased Childres also expressed appreciation that he gets to be so involved in the process.</p>

<p>Petkov also echo'd that sentiment "the approval process is very good, there are some things that we need to change, obviously, but generally speaking most things are approved first time."</p>

<h2>From Imagination To Screen</h2>

<p>Petkov did let me in on the idea that "the most challenging things, and the things that we had the most to talk about were things that didn't exist."</p>

A Metallic Ruin to explore, a zombie blacksmith boss that just used a guard token, or a moving elevator that is represented on your dining room table.</p>

<p>In Board Games it's easy to substitute miniatures or describe an environment in text, but adapting that to a video game means you need to create assets for it all. Luckily for all of these places where there wasn't art the artists at Snapshot Games were excited to create these unique elements.</p>

<h2><em>Frosthaven </em>Steam Next Fest Demo</h2>

<p>From there I sat down with the Steam Next Fest Demo of the game, ready to get into the tutorial mission and explore <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>Starting the game I was brought to a party creation screen, selecting Bonechiller and Drifter, I could quickly review cards and abilities and purchase starting equipment. Asking how players had reacted to the Closed Beta that was held earlier it was the look of Bonechiller and Drifter that had actually received quite a bit of feedback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=Xd9-c7td 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=QhmACOBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updated feedback to these characters makes them more terrifying (and less ewok-y)</figcaption></figure><p>For Bonechiller, players though she should have more/deeper scars to reflect her tortured gameplay style, taking damage to summon creatures to fight for her. On the other hand, the Drifter was thought to have a face "too much like an Ewok".</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early Access Stats</strong><br>
When <em>Frosthaven </em>releases in Early Access there will be Six playable characters for you to play as and unlock. There will be 30 Scenarios from the Board Game made available, that means of the total 136 Scenarios approximately 22% of the game will be available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entering the first cutscene it was explained that the games events are fully voiced, this audio comes from the <em>Official Frosthaven Companion App</em>. By working together they were able to avoid reinventing the wheel and create a premium experience.</p>

<p>Loading into the first scenario Bonechiller and Drifter were placed on the board. Where the Board Game uses different dual sided hex tiles the world of <em>Frosthaven </em>has been more built out. In the snowy forest where I faced a group of Algox raiders the edges of the playable space were built up with rocks and foliage before drifting off into a haze. It didn't feel like the landscape stopped, but that it just wasn't in focus, leading to a better sense of immersion in the world.</p>

<h2>UI And Player Tooltips</h2>

<p>Speaking of the Beta feedback UI/UX was one that Petkov highlighted to me. "That's why we're doing the demo, that's why we are doing Early Access. It's so important because this game is really hard to do when it comes to UI. You want to shortcut things, then some people get mad because they want the agency, right?"</p>

<p>Character portraits appeared to the left, a list of combat participants to the top of the screen, and a list of selectable cards flew out in front of me. Each card I hovered over presented all of the information required in a quick and easy to digest format.</p>



<p>Petkov also showed me with a single key additional tool tips could be expended out related to just about anything your cursor is hovering over. If you want to know what the symbols are on a card, what any character has in their inventory, or even more information about an enemy fighter you can quickly gather it.</p>

<p>This is the kind of efficiency that I can imagine getting a lot of use out of at the start of the game, that would make me far more glad in the late game when I don't need any of that information and want less text and windows to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, while playing I did notice that there were a lot of 'confirmation' steps, that took place. You'd select two cards and then confirm, select where you want a character to move and have to confirm, pick the only enemy next to your character and have to confirm the attack.</p>

<p>At any point where it looked like my clicks weren't working around the screen my eyes began to learn to dart to the bottom of the screen to see if a red "Confirm" box had appeared.</p>

Before reaching the (currently burning) gates of <em>Frosthaven </em>you could see a hint of it in the fog surrounding the map. A neat tease for something big you're about to open up a door into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Differences In Difficulty and Enemy AI</strong><br>
Alongside the standard <em>Frosthaven </em>gameplay, there is also a Story mode as well as a mode with increased difficulty. Based on feedback from the Open Beta they have made it that the enemy AI tends to move in a way that's better for the player, as that's how a lot of people play at home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skipping through the rest of the battle I was introduced to the settlement building phase. Here there were a wide variety of options presented to me. Build and upgrade buildings, purchase new equipment or try to upgrade it with resources, and even potion creation where trial and error can lead to the discovery of new recipes.</p>

<p>This isometric view of <em>Frosthaven</em>, with plenty of empty plots of land, showed off just how far you'll be able to go when you get your hands on the game.</p>



<p><em>Frosthaven</em>, the board game, is an epic experience. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8e2e88-4e90-4808-88d3-e7f73952c19d" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/frosthaven-unboxing-is-lengthy-and-almost-perfect" rel="nofollow">A heavy box filled with all manner of characters, cards, boards, maps, and booklets</a>. If you're able to get the box, a consistent group of friends, and the time to play it's well worth the experience. It's also understandable that for many getting the stars to align in such a way can just be impossible.</p>

<p>With the <em>Frosthaven </em>video game a lot of the stress of time and setup is washed away, with voice acting and beautiful (and scary) environments this is already shaping up to be an incredible way to experience <em>Frosthaven </em>without a number of the barriers to entry.</p>
