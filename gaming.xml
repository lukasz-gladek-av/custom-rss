<p dir="ltr">Catalysts are the base power of the spell, with Blizzard describing it as the "foundation." There are six Catalysts to choose from, like Disintegrate and Propulsion, that will give the spell its form and function.</p><p dir="ltr">Next are Infusions, which imbue the spell with its elemental damage type and some special effects. Lastly, players can equip three Arcana, which are used to modify the spell in a variety of ways, from granting players Unstoppable after using their Horadric spell to gaining Stealth for several seconds after use. Some Legendary Arcana grant fairly powerful effects, like the Floaty Bobble Arcana, which adds a Blink component to the spell, or the Bloody Charm, which simply executes non-boss enemies with 10% life or less when the spell is activated.</p><p dir="ltr">The Horadric Spellcraft system isn't entirely different from how seasonal powers have worked in previous seasons (a common complaint among the playerbase), but does seem to give players more flexibility than before in terms of both what powers and what damage types they want to use.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Horadric Spellcrafting will just be one component of Season 9. Blizzard, in its quest, to continue improving base elements of Diablo 4's endgame (as detailed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap</a>) is also putting a heavy emphasis on Nightmare dungeons, with new positive affixes that will benefit players in the form of more specialized crafting rewards or specific types of gear. Players will also (finally) be able to jump into a new Nightmare dungeon while still inside a different one, rather than having to leave the dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">New for the season will be Horadric Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares. Strongrooms are mini-dungeons inside Nightmare dungeons where players will use a wayfinder to find a hidden Horadric vault. Players will need to battle through demons in a set amount of time in order to claim the Strongroom's rewards, and the difficulty of the Strongroom, and its rewards, can be adjusted and increased by activating various modifiers similar to players add modifiers in the Infernal Hordes activity. Additionally, players earn Horadric Jewels to put in their gear to further modify their Horadric spell.</p><p dir="ltr">Escalating Nightmares is a new spin on Nightmare dungeons that sees the effects of three different Nightmare dungeons stack in succession. Players will need to earn Escalation Sigils from Horadric Storerooms to challenge the Escalating Nightmares. Those who survive all three dungeons in succession will then battle against a new boss encounter with Astaroth, who players may remember from Diablo 4's base campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 will be playable on the game's PTR from May 27 to June 3, as Blizzard looks to test the season's new systems as well as various balance changes and new Unique items. According to Diablo 4's in-game timers, Season 9 proper will begin July 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Diablo 4 Season 8, Belial's Return, is in full swing, having revamped the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">endgame boss cycle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">battle pass</a> (the latter of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">hasn't exactly gone over well</a>).

                <p>After Bungie was hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">plagiarism allegations for its Marathon revamp</a>, more information has been revealed about other problems within the company. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">Aside from a toxic work environment</a> coming from the top of Bungie, company heads were pitching to give <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> a subscription service on top of already paying for a PlayStation Plus membership.</p><p>Former Bungie employees spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly belittle staff.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," said a former Destiny 2 developer, which was the focus point for many former employees. When higher-ups pitched a subscription model for Destiny 2, it was only allegedly shut down due to the staff's "vehement" opposition. That would mean players would pay for a sub on top of other necessary subs like PS Plus, depending on your platform. Bungie's leadership followed that up by reportedly holding a meeting where the staff were given a "monetization scolding" for not enabling enough microtransactions.</p><p>Bungie has made numerous changes to Destiny 2's monetization since its launch nearly eight years ago, including a shift to a free-to-play model. The company has had to increase the relevance of the Eververse store and seasonal content passes, both of which include paid cosmetics.</p><p>In late 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Bungie reduced its workforce by over 300 roles</a>, after a drastic fall in revenue. This put even more pressure on different methods of monetizing its games.</p><p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">were part of these layoffs</a> and general sentiment around Marathon has not been the best, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/">its developers are asking fans to give the game a chance</a>, despite the surrounding controversy.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a>.</p>

The original story and voice acting have been preserved, but the game features enhancements such as 3D audio and new graphical flourishes, such as Snake's clothing degrading over time. The control scheme has been reworked and modernized, but fans can still play using the classic control setup. Additionally, the remake lets players choose between experiencing the game using a new third-person behind-the-shoulder view and the original game's overhead viewpoint (known as Legacy Style).&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can pick up Naked Snake's revamped adventure when it launches on August 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA's reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series was a roller coaster of a journey, to say the least. The 2015 game was liked but blasted for a lack of content, an offline mode, and no campaign.</p>
<p>Then the 2017 sequel was, by all accounts, a noted improvement gameplay-wise, but the microtransactions that EA stuffed into it practically killed the game, driving players away at launch. EA supported the game for another three years and was able to turn the ship around with the removal of its awful microtransactions, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-visuals-improvements/">consistent updates</a> to improve the game, culminating in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-celebration-edition-leaks/">Celebration Edition</a> of the game that gave players access to every piece of content that was previously paywalled.</p>
<p>But neither the reboot nor the original series ever made it to a third entry. Star Wars Battlefront III has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-iii-pitched/">pitched</a> and even worked on, in the case of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-star-wars-battlefront-3-free-radical">original PS2-era series,</a> but never made it to fruition.</p>
<p>Hope rises for Battlefront III once again after a recent surge in popularity in Battlefront II, and (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-2-devs-want-to-get-the-band-back-together-to-make-battlefront-3/">VGC</a>), developers who worked on Battlefront II want to "<em>get the gang back together</em>" to make Battlefront III.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3"> Reddit</a> about a previous comment he had made that Battelfront II developers want to see the series get a third entry, Mats Helge Holm, who worked as a producer on Battelfront II, said, "<em>Me,</em> <em>having heard around my group of ex-colleagues, we want to get the gang back together.</em>"</p>
<p>Holm isn't the only one who has worked on Star Wars making the call for Battlefront III. Andor actor Muhannad Ben Amor also called for Battlefront III on<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes"> Instagram</a>, admitting he's a massive Battlefront fan, having logged 469 hours in Battlefront II.</p>
<p>Even with this new surge in popularity, players shouldn't be expecting EA to green-light a new Battlefront game anytime soon. In the thread where Holm comments that he and other former members of the Battlefront II team would like to work together again on Battlefront III, he says, "<em>I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally. But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it</em>."</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Battlefront II, it's worth hopping back in to enjoy the rush of players filling up matches. But keep your expectations in check regarding the chances of a third game ever happening.</p>

A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega has announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, and it's not coming to PlayStation 5--at least not right away. The new version is coming for Xbox Series X|S and PC, but there is no word yet on a potential release for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The game launches on June 10, and it'll be available through Xbox Game Pass.

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-cod-under-microsoft-wont-try-to-do-slimy-platform-things/1100-6524115/" data-ref-id="1100-6524115">trying to give players a choice about where they play their games</a>, as opposed to doing "slimy platform things to force you to do what I want." Space Marine is a Sega-published game, however.</p><p>The game, developed by Relic Entertainment, was originally released in 2011 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. The new Master Crafted edition marks the first time Space Marine will be playable on any Xbox other than Xbox 360 because it never came to the backwards-compatible program for newer Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Master Crafted edition is developed by SneakyBox and features 4K resolution, modernized controls, an overhaul to the interface, improved character models, and remastered audio. Producer Vaidas Mikelskas told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the game "isn't just a technical upgrade--it's a thoughtful restoration."</p><p>Space Marine 2 followed in 2024, and Space Marine 3 is now in the works.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the big announcements from the recent Warhammer Skulls event in the gallery below.</p>

Now, in its open beta, Schedule 1 will no longer require employees to be registered to beds.</p><p>Instead, you'll be able to place a locker, which has a much smaller footprint, and removes the possibility of employee pathways becoming entangled, leading to some very confused, and very stuck, NPCs.

Trash cans will now show the area they apply to as you're placing them down, too.</p><p>As well as a host of bug fixes, item-slot filters have also been added to the game. This means that certain slots on storage shelves can have specific items blacklisted, so your perfectly organized farmhouse will no longer descend into chaos when left in the hands of your employees.</p><p>Rounding off the patch notes, TVGS says that an in-game voting system is in the works, with the first vote likely to commence next week. Here, you can vote on which features you'd like to see in the next major update. Those features are "likely" to be a cartel update, a police expansion, or the addition of Shrooms to manufacturable products.</p><p>These updates are only on the beta branch of the game. To access it, right-click Schedule 1 in your Steam inventory and select properties. Then, click "betas" and select the "beta" branch. As some of these features are experimental, make sure to back up your save before changing over.</p>

			<p>A Gears of War: Reloaded beta could be announced soon, judging from what has been recently discovered.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ktfpwe/gears_of_war_reloaded_beta_to_be_announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the unannounced beta was added to the Steam backend yesterday, as seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3749450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, so it's likely that it will be officially confirmed soon. Unfortunately, there is no information on when the beta could take place or what it will offer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will mark the PlayStation debut of one of the series that has long been synonymous with the Xbox brand. Announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/"> earlier this month</a>, the game is a remaster of the first entry in the series developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, featuring all the content released for the original, as well as that included in the Ultimate Edition, such as the single-player campaign, all post-launch DLC, and every multiplayer map and play mode. The remaster will also enhance the experience with 4K resolution support on all platforms, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS in multiplayer, HDR and VRR support, visual improvements, and cross-platform progression and multiplayer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded launches on August 25th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition before the remaster's announcement on May 5th will get the remaster via a free upgrade.</p>

<p>Game Boy games, along with games from other systems, are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong" rel="nofollow">sporadically added</a> to the subscription service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">library</a>, and unlike Nintendo 64 games (or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">upcoming GameCube library</a> for Switch 2), you won't need an Expansion Pack for these titles.</p>

<p>First to be added in today's haul is the 1999 Konami game&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids</em>, which features some pretty innovative open-world survival gameplay for its time. It's a forefather of the DS'&nbsp;<em>Lost in Blue&nbsp;</em>series, and a new&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>game is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">heading to the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/survival-kids-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025.jpg?itok=tkyCKQNk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/survival-kids-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025.jpg?itok=ssPIt_rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>is one of four games joining the Nintendo Switch Online library today.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up is side-scrolling shooter&nbsp;<em>Gradius The Interstellar Assault</em>, which brings the series' trademark frantic spaceship action to the small screen. If you're a fan of previous (or subsequent)&nbsp;<em>Gradius&nbsp;</em>titles, you'll probably love this one too.</p>

<p>Your third new Game Boy game in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Kirby's Star Stacker</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Puzzle League</em>-style descending block puzzler that takes&nbsp;<em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>aesthetics and transposes them into a&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em>-style gameplay system.</p>

<p>Finally, today's Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy lineup brings&nbsp;<em>The Sword of Hope&nbsp;</em>to Nintendo Switch Online. It's an RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Kid Klown&nbsp;</em>studio Kemco, and while it's a little basic by today's standards, it's still got a rough charm to it.</p>

<p>All four of these games were previously available in the West, so none of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" rel="nofollow">getting a release outside Japan</a> for the first time, but some of them are likely not to have graced your Game Boy shelf in the past given their rarity.</p>




<p>You can play all four of these Game Boy games right now on Nintendo Switch Online if you've got an active subscription, and if you haven't, then you can sign up for one via your console's eShop.</p>

Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode One Recap: Everybody Hates Joel</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Welcome back to another recap of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ.."><em>The Last of Us</em> season two</a></span>.

                <p>Nintendo has revealed four new games coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library today, May 23. They are Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirbys-star-stacker/" data-ref-id="5000-6379">Kirby Star Stacker</a> is the highest-profile addition. Originally released by HAL Laboratory in 1997, it is a puzzle game with gameplay similar to Tetris Attack or Pokemon Puzzle League. Players have to match blocks that look like Rick, Coo, and Kine from Kirby's Dream Land 2. The Super Famicom version of this game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-brings-three-games-to-us-for-first-time-ever/1100-6517513/" data-ref-id="1100-6517513">came to Nintendo Switch Online in 2023</a>, but now the original release also has a place as part of Nintendo's subscription service.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRmpwGGTXOo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/survival-kids-1999/" data-ref-id="5000-11627">Survival Kids</a> is another notable inclusion this month because it's a Konami franchise about to be reimagined for Nintendo Switch 2. The original Survival Kids is a cult classic that tasks players with surviving on a deserted island. If you enjoy modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a>, they owe a lot to games like Survival Kids that helped trailblaze some of the genre's mechanics. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of Survival Kids looks like a lighthearted, cooperative reinterpretation of the series' formula, it's nice to have the rare Game Boy original available through Switch Online now.</p><p>Game Boy enthusiasts will also enjoy the other two games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault/" data-ref-id="5000-15933">Gradius: The Interstellar Assault</a> is a solid Game Boy version of Konami's classic arcade shoot 'em up. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sword-of-hope/" data-ref-id="5000-16075">The Sword of Hope</a> is an ambitious but lesser-known RPG for Nintendo's handheld console.</p><p>Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope all now available to play through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

The clip here is only 40 seconds long and it contains brand-new footage, but don't get too hyped up unless you're a fan of post-apocalyptic environmental ASMR.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRutwoEyG3s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRutwoEyG3s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In case you can't click the video above, all you're missing out on is a brief clip of an open prepper shelter waiting for a brave deliveryman to come pick up some cargo. At the very least, it's a nice look at the more arid terrain that you'll be able to explore in Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Beyond that tissue-pack marketing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a>. This model features a sleek black finish and insignia based on the fictional Drawbridge company in the sequel, and it's priced at $85. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2 releases for PS5 on June 26</a>, and several previews for the game recently went live.</p><p>While feedback has been mostly positive so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/">game director Hideo Kojima isn't satisfied</a> and he wants to see a few "controversial" opinions about the sequel.</p><p>"I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the current Switch doesn't ask for a phone number for voice chat, a separate mobile device is still needed to talk with friends through the Nintendo Switch Online app. This will eventually get renamed to the Nintendo Switch app sometime this month and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/">where you find Zelda Notes</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the enhanced Switch 2 Editions</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, a report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/">GameChat including a couple of helpful accessibility features</a>: text-to-chat speech functionality and live chat translation. However, both were showcased in Japanese, so it's unknown officially what languages may be supported on the upcoming system.</p><p>Switch 2 is set to launch on June 5 for $450, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">preorders sold out</a> almost immediately. That said, Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">Doug Bowser believes the company can meet demand for the console</a> throughout the rest of this year.</p>

            <p>Project Milo was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionhead-project-milo-existed-before-wed-even-heard-of-kinect">initially revealed alongside Microsoft's Kinect device all the way back in 2009</a>, and featured a young character named Milo who players could interact with. However, it never actually made it to release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-project-milo-cancelled">the project was cancelled in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>So, what happened? Well, Peter Molyneux recently shared his side of the story during Nordic Game 2025 in Malmö, explaining how changing priorities led to the end of the project and how he didn't want to "prance around like a twat".</p>

<p>"I'll tell you exactly what happened," Molyneux said, as transcribed by Eurgamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/peter-molyneux-recalls-how-project-milo-the-kinect-game-with-revolutionary-promise-died-a-death">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Microsoft had [bought] us, we were owned by Microsoft, and they had...I'm going to say this, I might get in trouble...what I thought was a bit of a crazy idea. And that was to do gesture recognition as an input device, rather than a controller. They showed me this stuff, and Microsoft had this amazing research building. Incredible.</p>
<p>"It was run by this brilliant bloke called Alex Kipman. Makes me look boring and passionless – he had ten times more passion than I had. He had this demo of this device, and when he showed me this demo, it could see people's faces. He said, 'it can do voice recognition', and it had a massive field-of-view so it could see this whole room."</p>
<p>When Kipman first asked Molyneux his thoughts on the tech that would ultimately end up as the Kinect, the game developer replied:</p>
<p>"'Well, firstly' - when he did the demo, he was jumping all over the room - 'I'm a gamer, I don't want to play games standing up. That's the first thing. It doesn't appeal to me, I want to sit back, I want to smoke what I smoke, and I want to drink what I want to drink, and I don't want to prance around like a twat'."</p>
<p>Molyneux said he would go and instead create a demo of how he believed the technology should be used, with a more sedentary slant with a focus on feeling. For this, he took inspiration from his then seven-year-old son, Lucas.</p>
<p>"Anyone who's a parent will probably experience this: there was this moment where you realise you're <em>crafting</em>, inspiring, a human being," the developer said. "Wouldn't it be an incredible thing to create a game around that feeling… About inspiring, in Milo's case, a boy. That was contentious in itself, because of course, lots of people go to the dark side with that [idea]."</p>
<p>Staff at Molyneux's studio Lionhead subsequently started work on the demo, and began collaborating with a technology company on Project Milo's voice recognition.</p>
<p>"We had all sorts of experiences, like you could hand things to Milo in the game world and he would take them. They really worked well."</p>
<p>The team "cheated in a big way about how you could talk to Milo",  Molyneux said, adding he wanted to make sure that players would be able to relax on the couch at the end of a day (or, to be fair, in the middle of it), and "just experience things with this game character".</p>
<p>"Even though voice recognition now is almost a solved problem, back in those days we solved the problem by cheating," Molyneux explained. "So, when Milo asked you the player a question, we had set that question up to different points, so he knew what sort of answer he'd give."</p>
<p>The developer went on to explain some more about the behind the scenes of Project Milo, admitting it was unfortunate that at the same time as all of this was going on, Microsoft was also working on its Kinect device.</p>
<p>"And [Microsoft] realised that the device that Alex Kipman first showed off would cost $5k for consumers to buy. So they cost-reduced that device down to such a point, where the field-of-view… I think it was a minuscule field-of-view. In other words, it could only just see what's straight in front of you."</p>
<p>In the end, changing priorities at Microsoft, which wanted to focus on the Kinect, led to the end of Project Milo. Molyneux said the "death blow" which still "breaks his heart" today, "was that it was decided that Kinect shouldn't be a gaming device: it should be a party device. You should play a sports game with it, or dancing games with it."</p>
<p>Project Milo, then, "didn't fit into the Microsoft portfolio", and the whole thing was ultimately canned.</p>
<p>"No one ever saw the complete experience," Molyneux closed. "We didn't finish the experience. But it was a magical thing. What was so magical about it: it wasn't about heroes and aliens coming down, there wasn't this 'end of the world' narrative scenario.</p>
<p>"It was just experiencing what it's like to hang out with someone that loves you."</p>

<p>Eurogamer spoke to Molyneux last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">about his Masters of Albion project</a>. Masters of Albion will take place "in the land of Albion", and has - in the words of Katharine Castle - big Black and White energy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">a more customisable bent that lets you design buildings, meals, armour and more</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch lineup mainly consists of existing games ported to the new console, with very few exceptions, and one of them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-will-run-at-4k60-with-hdr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST FUSION</a>.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity racing game series made by Munich-based developer Shin'en Multimedia is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. The first installment, FAST RACING LEAGUE, debuted on the Wii in May 2011. FAST RACING NEO then launched on the Wii U in 2015, and an enhanced version of that game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fast-rmx-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST RMX</a> debuted as a launch title for the Switch in March 2017.</p>
<p>FAST FUSION is also a launch title. However, this time around, it's a brand new installment with new features like Hyperjumps and Vehicle Fusion. As usual, it'll also be a technical showcase, and the studio has already shared that it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with High Dynamic Range support. Jack Merluzzi, the announcer known for his work on F-Zero GX, is returning from FAST RACING NEO.</p>
<p>We sent Shin'en Multimedia a few questions to learn more about their new game and discuss their experience with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you start working on your Nintendo Switch 2 game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We have been working since 2024 on the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Wow, that's not long at all. Were you really able to make FAST FUSION in just one year, or was it in development before?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The game wasn't in development before, but as we work on our own tools and engine and had done several FAST games before, we were able to speed up development a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>After some time with the new hardware, what was the most impressive&nbsp;new feature for you and why?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The new GPU features are, of course, most interesting to us from a developer's perspective. Having an HDR compatible display now makes quite a big difference in our game's look.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? How are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the new HD rumble is very impressive. We use it in many places in FAST FUSION and it intensifies the action quite a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What are the main improvements that players will notice in FAST FUSION over the previous installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>First of all, players will of course notice the much more detailed, alive and vibrant tracks, but the new core elements like Vehicle Fusion and Hyperjumps are what take Fast Fusion to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How will the Vehicle Fusion feature work?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can use any vehicles you acquired in the game for Fusion (just by playing, we have no microtransactions). With Vehicle Fusion, you bring together two vehicles of your liking to create a hybrid of both. So you can, for instance, fuse a fast vehicle with low acceleration with a heavy vehicle that has fast acceleration. The new vehicle will combine the best of both worlds. Also, the looks of both vehicles will be merged into a totally new one.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Very interesting. Can't wait to try it. Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025 globally. Nintendo won't be providing pre-release review units and codes to the press, but look forward to our reviews of the new hardware and some of the launch games later in June.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date" rel="nofollow">April's Version 1.7</a>, Version 2.0 will arrive on June 6th across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available. It'll bring a new area to explore, new characters to add to your lineup, and more, just as you'd expect from a HoYoverse update.</p>

<p>First up, you'll be embarking on "an exhilarating new journey" that will take you to the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu". There, you'll discover new exploration gameplay mechanics, "further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon", and more.</p>

<p>She's joined by fellow S-rank Agent Ju Fufu, a Yunkui Summit disciple who deals Physical and Fire damage and boosts her squad's critical damage with her Tiger's Roar buff.</p>

<p>Finally, rounding out the playable character roster for Version 2.0 is the A-rank Physical Defense Agent Pan Yinhu, a "kitchen-savvy panda" who brings some serious attitude to your team. S-rank Bangboo Belion will also be added to the game in this update.</p>

<p>They'll join Astra Yao and Caesar, two S-rank Agents who are getting reruns as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Version 2.0 banners. Not only that, but since this update marks the game's first anniversary, you'll be able to "choose one S-rank Agent and one S-rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free".</p>




<p>Of course, this update also introduces plenty of quality-of-life improvements like a new 3D map for navigation, new beacons that allow you to revive characters and restore HP, and other optimizations.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 launches across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a> on June 6th.</p>

            <p>
An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> live action film is in the works from Ex Machina director Alex Garland, film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco. It’s not clear whether developers From Software are involved, but Game Of Thrones novelist George R. R. Martin - who worked on Elden Ring’s story and characters alongside From boss Hidetaka Miyazaki - is contributing as a producer. All of this comes via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 Miyazaki has dangled the prospect of a movie adaptation in the past, while stressing that film-making very much isn’t his wheelhouse. “I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” he told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> last year. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium. So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play. We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.” 
</p>
<p>
There’s no word yet as to the story, characters and cast, let alone a release date. Perhaps predictably, I struggle to imagine a film that captures the ambience of a From Software game, in which so much of the charm is being the one real agent of change in a static, ruined world. But I can think of a few references for the moodboard: David Lowery’s silty cinematic adaptation of Gawain And The Green Knight and Matteo Garrone’s dynastic triptych Tale of Tales. Perhaps they could pay homage to the soapstone functionality by encouraging audiences to write “is this a dog?” on the box office posters.
</p>
<p>It'll be a while till we learn more, I expect. In the meantime, you can get your fix of Limgrave from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Enemy level scaling is an age-old issue that folks complained about back in the Xbox 360 days, and yes, it’s still problematic in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>. Every enemy you face scales alongside you, so they’ll grow in power as you level up. It makes for a challenging RPG, to say the least. Thankfully, this version of the game altered how leveling works slightly, so you can place points into three Attributes each time you gain a rank.</p><p>To avoid becoming overwhelmed, don’t opt for an entirely passive playthrough, though. It won’t work well to just avoid fights. Instead, mix and match your skills by, say, choosing Mercantile <em>and </em>Blade. After all, anyone traveling the roads of Cyrodiil could benefit from a hidden knife.</p><h2 id="h325525"><a id="2"></a>Stealing is lucrative, so long as you can find a fence</h2><figure id="" data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing a stealth-focused character, specifically a thief making a living robbing everyone in sight, you’ll soon learn that selling stolen goods proves problematic in Cyrodiil.

You need a fence!</p><p>You won’t find a fence out in the wild, not easily. Instead, join the Thieves’ Guild to unlock Ongar the World-Weary, a fence in Bruma, who will buy stolen items.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, May 23, 2025. Below, we look back at how its villains were unusually sympathetic, lending weight to the story.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's one of the most haunting scenes in any Fire Emblem game. A soldier and temporary king, Orson, is seen talking with the reanimated corpse of his wife, Monica. She only says one thing--"darling"--over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson, one of the many antagonists in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-review/1900-6126647/">Fire Emblem Sacred Stones</a>, was a man devoted to Monica long before the campaign of the game began. He's only present during a short part of the story, but he leaves a major impression once the credits roll after the game's 30 chapters come to a close. While you'll first meet him as a playable character, he eventually betrays Ephraim, Eirika, and the other heroes in order to (as he believes) save his wife's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though this story plays out solemnly on a 2.5 inch Game Boy screen, it packs a punch that remains one of the most memorable parts of Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones. Orson's tale, along with those of the other villains in Sacred Stones, exemplifies the type of personal story that sets the Fire Emblem series apart from other strategy games. It provides a personal, intimate look at enemies before we fight them on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LmocGJOdZk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9LmocGJOdZk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Orson's betrayal comes as a shock. When the idea of a turncloak hiding in Eirika and Ephraim's forces is brought up by an enemy commander, it's not immediately clear who he's referring to. We find out when Orson tries to trick Eirika into handing over one of the keys to the games namesake, the sacred stones, while leading her right into the hands of the enemy. Then, he's dismissed and nearly disappears from the story.</p><p dir="ltr">We see him nine chapters later in a terrible state, living for nothing but the reanimated corpse of his wife. We witness brief scenes where he brings her gifts and lashes out at the people around him for the mere act of interrupting their time alone. These moments are short, intimate looks at an unwound man who has forsaken everything in his life for the memory of his love. Our last look at Orson comes from combat dialogue right before he is killed.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the one I love, I betray everything," Orson tells Eirika before they cross swords near the halfway point of Sacred Stone's campaign. "My country, my lord and master… everything."</p><p dir="ltr">While few would endorse his actions, it's easy to understand why Orson made them. Laying the scene out before us--as unsettling as it is--puts him in the spotlight as if he was one of the games' protagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">We get a similarly personal look at Lyon, the prince of Grado who serves as the secondary antagonist in Sacred Stones, that gives plenty of weight to his villainy. Like Orson, one of Lyon's primary drivers is saving someone close to him through experimentation with dangerous magic. He uses the sacred stone, which is a seal that helps contain a powerful demon, to push healing magic, which isn't known to help with grievous injuries in the world of Sacred Stones, further than it's ever been pushed before.</p><p dir="ltr">"If I can just press my studies a little harder [...] I think I might be able to use it to heal my father’s illness," Lyon says at one point in the story. "If that works, there’s no telling how many other people I can help as well."</p><p dir="ltr">As you might have guessed, Lyon's experimentations backfire. He eventually loses control and is influenced by the demon sealed through the sacred stones, before being finally convinced that the only way to prevent a cataclysmic event is to free the demon.</p><p dir="ltr">We see the backstory of Lyon's father sickness, his childhood relationships with Ephraim and Eirika, and his struggles with his poor health and lack of self-confidence throughout the game. Flashbacks, combat dialogue, and story sequences lay out the motivations of a ruler in complete despair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303" data-ratio="0.66701461377871" data-width="958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303"></a><figcaption>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Getting such a sincere look at the villain's perspective is one way to convince us that Ephraim and his army aren't just cutting down evil, faceless enemies. The scenes with Orson and Lyon throughout the campaign overshadow the fantastical demonic villain that enters the fray later on.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem is a franchise that wants you to care about the units you fight with and against. You're not sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, you're sending characters that you've recruited, trained with, leveled up, and grown closer to over the course of the game. It's not uncommon for fans of the series to abort missions and start over as soon as one of their heroes falls on the battlefield. The thought of going on without them is too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Sacred Stones exemplifies this part of the franchise. Moulder, a gentle priest who acts as a father figure to other units and Joshua, a talented swordsman with an unhealthy obsession with gambling, are just two of the 30 units that you can learn about as you watch them interact with one another before each mission. Building out your go-to squad is like choosing which friends you want to spend time with over the course of the games' story.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson and Lyon--villains that are only roadblocks in the path to the game's main demonic antagonist--serve as sobering examples of villains who are tragically relatable. We see why they do what they do firsthand, giving them just as much of a story as any other character in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Later Fire Emblem games have built on what entries like Sacred Stones established for the franchise. Fire Emblem: Engage and Fire Emblem: Three Houses gave us more ways to build relationships with our soldiers on the field. Few games, however, have given us an equally as disturbing look into what would drive good people to commit horrible crimes.</p>

                <p>Following the recent closed test for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531250/" data-ref-id="1100-6531250">FBC: Firebreak</a>, game director Mike Kayatta from Remedy has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536602812925083778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> some of the changes that the studio is making to the game based on fan feedback.</p><p>Kyatta said Remedy has received lots of important and helpful feedback so far, and this will result in major changes to weapon balance. "Guns are upgradable in Firebreak, but we now think we went too far with how weak they felt at the earliest levels," Kyatta said. "In response, we are making all level-one guns radically more powerful, while adjusting other parts of the game to maintain the challenge balance."</p>

<p>Kyatta added that it heard from players that the double-barrel shotgun did not feel quite right, and the studio agrees, so it's making some changes to "make sure it meets the expectations of its shooting style." The developer also mentioned how "everything" related to general combat intensity and difficulty levels has been overhauled. "Among other things, we're tying different enemy types to different threat levels, adjusting wave frequency and composition, and removing awkward lulls in the action," Kyatta said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Kyatta said Remedy has added "dynamic tutorials" to the game to help players have a "clear path forward without limiting them from discovering alternate ways of going about things."</p><p>Additionally, Kyatta mentioned how the "visual clarity" of FBC wasn't quite right. "The chaos stops being fun when players can no longer make meaningful decisions based on what they're experiencing." With that in mind, Remedy is spending time "cleaning up and reducing a lot of effects in the game, both on-screen and in-world."</p><p>What's more, Kyatta said it was a known issue that the general in-game audio was too quiet in the early tests. The studio is now putting together the final audio mix for the game that should address this.</p><p>Finally, Kyatta said Remedy continues to work on "performance testing and improvements" for PC, which is why the minimum and recommend PC specs have not been announced yet. "We'll share those results as soon as we're confident in them," Kyatta said.</p><p>"We've still got a lot to do to make the launch experience the best it can be, but the team is feeling really good about where we are," he added.</p><p>FBC officially launches on June 17, and it's included as a day-one launch title for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Alternatively, it can be purchased outright for $40 for console and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-elden-ring-movie-is-in-the-works-for-some-reason.1197384/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware's runaway smash hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and a celebrated sci-fi director and writer is attached to the project already.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie will be produced by indie studio A24, which is also responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>, although adapting&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is arguably going to be significantly more of a challenge than Kojima's already-fairly-cinematic game.</p>

<p>Helming the project is Alex Garland, the creative force behind movies like&nbsp;<em>Annihilation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina</em>, and his most recent movie&nbsp;<em>Warfare</em>, an on-the-ground depiction of the Iraq war. He's also on writing duties.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=qHpVIosd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=CqPD1w-W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, because money is really, really appealing, I guess.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>co-writer George R.R. Martin will serve as a producer on the movie, but Deadline makes no mention of either FromSoftware or Hidetaka Miyazaki, which could suggest they're not involved in the project.</p>

<p>Naturally, movies are a very different business to games, but it's still a little troubling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s chief creative force doesn't appear to be a part of the movie. I suppose he's busy with next year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em></a>.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself here, but an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie seems like a pretty bad idea right from the outset. FromSoftware's open-world masterpiece is, after all, a game that tells its story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion, and it's hard to see how that's going to work in a two-hour ultra-linear movie.</p>

<p>Garland isn't necessarily the worst choice to helm&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; he's got form when it comes to intelligent fantasy and sci-fi, after all. Still, I can't shake the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is unfilmable, and that A24 and Garland have made rods for their own backs here.</p>




<p>We're likely a couple of years away from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie at the very least, but for now, if you want more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>shenanigans, you can content yourself with upcoming multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive next week</a>.</p>

<p>The Fall Of Avalon is set in another dark reimagining of Arthurian myth, one less abundant in beauty influencers than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">Tides Of Annihilation</a>. It takes place about 600 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>'s fall, in a realm of "unending strife" and plague that is divided into three zones.</p>
<p>The game is said to span 50-70 hours, with over 200 sidequests and an assortment of miscellaneous activities such as decorating your house, farming and "sketchbook journaling". I sincerely hope that last one is a fully fleshed-out illustration subgame, or at least some kind of fantasy photography mechanic. We need more virtual idylls like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eastshade">Eastshade</a>.</p>
<p>One overarching device is that the world worsens at night - that's when the Wyrdness, "a chaotic primordial force", comes out to play, making foes tougher. I too experience Wyrdness at night, but this is generally because I have decided to eat a family-sized bag of Flaming Hot Wotsits. The Fall Of Avalon's Wyrdness is a touch less gastric in origin. According to the backstory, King Arthur actually ousted it many centuries before during his conquest of Avalon. Now, it's back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Avalon, you are an omni-capable RPG everyperson who can go about wyrdo-murdering using any combination of stats, perks and equipment. "Want to be a crazy alchemist-berserker punching enemies to death? Sure," promises the Steam blurb. "A mystical blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes? We've got you covered. A stealthy archer lurking in the shadows? Say less - this is the game for stealth archer enthusiasts." Cry more, Thief.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on everything I've read about the game. There's talk of a "mature, morally grey story", for example. "Mature" and "morally grey" are terms used by rosy-cheeked children to describe the act of lying about whether they've brushed their teeth. Between that and the boilerplate industry talk of "limitless playstyles", "meaningful choices" and "love letters" to the Elder Scrolls-style RPG genre, I doubt this will be very surprising on the whole.</p>
<p>Still, I quite enjoy the art direction's core theme of "everlasting autumn", and I like the environment design's somewhat Fromsofty sense of rot. Did I mention there's a plague? It's called the Red Death. A bunch of priests are searching for a cure by means of torturous experimentation upon victims who are slowly transforming into monsters. Perhaps it's the Flaming Hot Wotsits talking, but that sounds like just the thing for a Friday night. Let us know if you've played this and Have Thoughts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
