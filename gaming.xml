			<p>Larian Studios' journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> began in <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/general-information_46#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20is%20using,game%20design%20in%20late%202016.">2016</a>, with a small team starting work on the game's design and story. Then, in 2020, the game launched in an early access state on PC before its full release three years later in 2023. Now, it's known as one of the best RPGs ever made.</p>
<p>Today, the journey has ended in a significant way, with Larian Studios releasing the "<em>final major game patch</em>" for Baldur's Gate 3, Patch 8, which is now live on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and PC. This is the final patch Larian will release that includes new content, and every update after this will focus on continued maintenance and bug fixing.</p>
<p>"<em>We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we're continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future,</em>" the studio wrote in a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a> on its website.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwCyTt8fSAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you new ways to make out with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for your most evil runs, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">subclasses</a>, cross-play functionality is one of the more significant features added in Patch 8, and it'll even work with most mods you might want to use. There are a few hang-ups, though, like the fact that all players will have to have the same version of the mods installed, and PC players squadding up with console players will need to be aware that only mods compatible with consoles will work when trying to use cross-play across PC and console devices.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble, Larian put together a handy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI">video guide</a> to take you through the process. Larian even put together a video guide to help you learn the ropes with the newly included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RrZaWrZG-8">Photo Mode</a> to apply your photography skills to the world of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes here to dig into every adjustment and change in Patch 8.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june-for-improvements.1164771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Funcom has announced that upcoming survival game&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure the devs can implement "improvements".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Funcom says that it still needs "a bit more time to cook" in order to "act on a lot more of the feedback" provided by beta testers in the past few months. As such,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 10th instead of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date" rel="nofollow">previously-set date of May 20th</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't take the decision to move the game's release date "lightly", but that the three extra weeks will give Funcom "the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=dgfONd6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=GZhzaVBY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to come out.</figcaption></figure><p>Funcom also says that this delay will allow it to "do a large-scale beta weekend next month", during which more people will get the chance to play&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>and provide feedback to the team.</p>

<p>The studio closes by calling&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"a beast of a game" that represents "multiplayer survival on a massive scale", and it goes on to say that the game is "making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it is, believe it or not, a survival game set in the universe of Frank Herbert's popular&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels. However, the game takes place in an alternate version of the books' timeline in which Paul Atreides was never born and Lady Jessica gave birth to a daughter.</p>




<p>Much like Funcom's other survival game&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>tasks you with surviving in a harsh desert environment. You'll comb Arrakis for resources, crafting equipment and using iconic&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>vehicles to traverse the land.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dune-awakening/9pj6fv3130qz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 10th.</p>

                <p>Given the recent difficulties at Ubisoft, it was hard not to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin</a>'<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">s Creed Shadows</a> as a make or break game for the publisher. There's still some uncertainty about Ubisoft's plan to spin-off Assassin's Creed and other top franchises <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">into a dedicated subsidy with Tencent</a>, but the good news is that Shadows is reportedly one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">the best-selling games of the year</a> so far.</p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella said via his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account that Assassin's Creed Shadows "has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market." Piscatella went on to add that among games released in 2025, it is No. 2 to-date behind only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is also available to players who subscribe to Ubisoft+. However, the title's current success on the video game sales charts suggests that players are actively buying it as well.</p><p>Shadows still has a long ways to go before it can replicate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/" data-ref-id="1100-6530333">the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been delayed slightly to implement last minute changes from beta testers.</p>
<p>Back in February, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">Funcom announced a release date of 20th May on Steam</a>. That's now been pushed back to 10th June (with earlier access for pre-orders on 5th June).</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, Funcom explained a major preview beta has been initiated in addition to the game's ongoing Persistent Closed Beta that's provided "invaluable" feedback to ensure the studio can "launch a quality game".</p>

<p>"Thanks to this process, we've concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p>
<p>As a result of the delay, Funcom will launch a large-scale beta weekend next month, with more information expected soon.</p>
<p>"Dune: Awakening is a <em>beast </em>of a game," the studio said. "This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we're making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing."</p>

</span></p><p>There's no mention in the statement of the game's console release on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, which is expected to follow PC.</p>
<p>Before May was originally confirmed, the game had an "early 2025" release date. The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">executive producer Scott Junior told Eurogamer</a>: "I guess it depends how you define early. It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese came away impressed after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">hands-on with Dune: Awakening</a> at the start of the year, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within. Dune: Awakening has promise - keep an eye on this one."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More images of the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, which is seemingly becoming the industry's worst-kept secret, have apparently leaked, and from none other than the purported developer's very own website this time.</p>

<p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taurnil</a>&nbsp;spotted the images in the backend of developer Virtuos' website. Although it hasn't been confirmed by Bethesda, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">been reported</a> that Virtuos is working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, and these images rather seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>ResetEra user Mattmo831 also <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collected a number of images</a> from the&nbsp;Virtuos website, so although the images are no longer accessible via Virtuos' page, it's looking pretty unlikely that they're fake at this point. We won't be including them in this article, but they're easily accessible via the above links at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=zlfrXHOS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=A0qXEBKB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion</em>'s upcoming remake now seems like a foregone conclusion.</figcaption></figure><p>The images depict a wide range of scenes from&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, including one-to-one comparisons with the original, and surprise surprise, it looks like the new version will sport vastly improved visuals.</p>

<p>New key art has also seemingly been leaked, depicting an armored warrior standing in front of the game's logo, although there aren't any screenshots of the remake's conversation system yet, so we don't yet know if it's the same weird dead-eyed hoedown it was in the original.</p>

<p>Journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-release-date-reportedly-narrowed-down/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will "shadowdrop" - that is, launch without any prior fanfare - sometime in April. The sudden appearance of these screenshots on Virtuos' website would seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth bearing in mind that no announcement has officially been made by Bethesda or Virtuos, and so all of this is still technically speculation. Still, the evidence is mounting, so I'd be surprised if April passes with no word on the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=MDQy3q0u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=i94dF2l7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Virtuos has served as a co-development studio on games like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If Virtuos is indeed working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, past form would indicate it's a good choice for the project. Previous games worked on by Virtuos as a co-development studio include&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">the upcoming</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>(which, I suppose, would make the latter a Virtuos Mission).</p>

<p>We'll almost certainly hear something about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks (assuming, of course, it doesn't get shadowdropped tomorrow). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-launches-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-on-may-13-alongside-new-expansion-elderwood<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Singularity 6 is bringing its fantasy life sim adventure, <em>Palia</em>, to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on May 13. While the game has already been available for PC and Nintendo Switch for a time, this new batch of console players will be able to join in with full cross-platform support.</p>

<p>Originally released n 2023, <em>Palia</em> has thrived on its free-to-play multiplayer model that encourages people to explore, craft, and live the life sim they’ve always wanted. <em>Palia</em> has released over 24 content updates to date, including 800 housing items, seasonal events and minigames, trading and building mechanics, and immersive storylines.</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series launch, <em>Palia</em> will release its new round of content with the introduction of the Elderwood – a new Adventure Zone filled with a magical forest that is set to be the largest release since the original launch. Elderwood offers up new ways to explore, alongside familiar characters such as Nai’o and Subira with new quests.</p>

<p>In Elderwood, there’s new collectables, hostile huntable creatures such as the Ogapuu, and elusive ones like the Shmole. Players can also try their hand looking for various artifacts, which unlock a new equipment type called Relics, which can help buff up your party.</p>

<p><em>Palia</em> strives to be an experience the player can play at their own pace, with enough content for years to come.</p>




<p>Elderwood in particular sets off to prove as much with all of its addition. A brief demo included a further look at housing, and all the colorful collectables one can hold within. Of course, there’s fishing and farming to do too.</p>

<p>Once into the actual forest of the Elderwood, things start to get a little mysterious with plenty of purples and blues. There’s a lot of exploration to be had outside of the town, with plenty more materials to find for crafting and housing.</p>

<p>Palia’s resident NPCs are there too, and have plenty to say about what’s going on in the Edlerwood. Characters such as Nai’o are useful for learning more about the world, and taking on quests marked on the map.</p>

<p>All of this will be available on May 13 along with the return of the Refer a Friend program. Players can invite their friends to Palia to earn the Elderwood Fun Guy Plush in five different sizes.</p>

Well, we found out back in 2021's “The Matrix: Resurrections.” Despite other stars like Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning and reprising their roles in the fourth film in the franchise, Laurence Fishburne, who played and helped shape the iconic role of Morpheus, did not return.<br></p><p>Instead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the film as an alternate “version” of both Morpheus and the franchise’s villain, Agent Smith. Fans, of course, were confused and many let down by the omission of the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor in the film. Now, on a recent appearance on “The View,” Fishburne is finally opening up about why he was not involved in the film, and his answer will surprise you.</p><p>A fifth installment is currently in the works, and when asked by “The View” host Sara Haines asked if Fishburne would return, Fishburne replied, “It depends on the circumstances — who is involved, how well the script has been written, if they offer me.” He then said, “You know, I offered my services to the fourth <em>Matrix</em>, and they didn’t respond well.”</p><p>To the shock of the hosts including Sunny Hostin, Whoopi Goldberg and more, Fishburne continued, “So hey, it’s not like I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”</p><p>He then called it,  “the truth” of the situation, before adding, “So we’ll see.” Hostin chimed in then, saying, “You need to come back!” Haines added, “It sounds like a decision as to whether they want it to be a great ‘Matrix’...”</p><p>At the time of the fourth film’s announcement, Fishburne did publicly state that he was not invited, though did not go into the depth the same way he went today on “The View.” He simply said at the time, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923">we reported,</a></span> “I have not been invited. Maybe that will make me write another play. I wish them well. I hope it’s great.”</p><p>The fourth film was certainly a success and did well enough at the box office to justify a fifth installment. Hopefully this time the powers that be wake up and consider Fishburne’s offer, after all, he is all but synonymous with this series!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-5060-desktop-family-laptop-5060-coming-soon%2F" rel="sponsored">announcing</a> its RTX 5060 family of GPUs today, just a day before it releases the RTX 5060 Ti on April 16th. Two variants of the RTX 5060 Ti are launching, the $379 8GB of VRAM model and the $429 16GB version. The $299 RTX 5060 will launch at some point in May with 8GB of VRAM.</p><p>The RTX 5060 Ti will ship with 4,608 CUDA cores, a 2.4GHz base clock, 2.57GHz boost clock, and a 128-bit memory bus with either 8GB or 16GB of GDDR7. Nvidia says the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching on April 16th, but that the 8GB model will follow “shortly afterwards.” The cheaper RTX 5060 features 3,840 CUDA cores and uses a 128-bit memory bus with 8GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>Both the RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 will support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a> (up to 4x), as well as PCI Express Gen 5 and DisplayPort 2.1b. The RTX 5060 Ti will have a total graphics power of 180 watts, while the RTX 5060 will consume up to 145 watts.</p><p>Nvidia is promising high RTX 5060 frame rates in a variety of games, thanks mainly to Multi Frame Generation. The GPU maker has tested games at 1080p with max Frame Gen levels, AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, and 1080p max settings:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> - 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> - 234fps</span></li><li><span><em>Alan Wake II</em> - 114fps</span></li><li><span><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>- 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>- 148fps</span></li><li><span><em>Stalker 2</em> - 208fps</span></li><li><span><em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>- 105fps</span></li><li><span><em>Marvel Rivals </em>- 330fps</span></li><li><span><em>Avowed</em> - 220fps</span></li></ul></div><p>While Nvidia is obviously pushing 4x Frame Gen with these new RTX 5060 cards, there will also be performance improvements to rasterization. “In a game that doesn’t support Multi Frame Gen, you’ll see about a 20-25 percent performance improvement gen over gen on the RTX 5060,” says Justin Walker, Nvidia’s senior director director of GeForce product management, in a press briefing. “You’ll see about 20 percent on the RTX 5060 Ti.“</p><p>Nvidia isn’t making Founders Edition versions of the RTX 5060 cards, so it won’t be able to directly impact the pricing its board partners set this time around with its own cards. That means it might be very difficult to find an RTX 5060 at $299, especially with the uncertainty around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s tariff situation</a> that changes almost daily.</p><p>That said, the pricing might not be the only uncertain aspect of these new cards. The choice to offer 8GB of VRAM will be controversial, I’m sure. “We are trying to optimize price and performance,” says Walker. “When you get to a GPU like the RTX 5060, you have to look really hard at trade offs.”</p><p>Nvidia argues that VRAM doesn’t have a big impact on GPU performance, and that it has optimized for pricing with the RTX 5060 series. But we’re still regularly seeing games consume a lot of memory, which really impacts 8GB cards. “The RTX 2060 was $349, and that was years ago,” says Walker. “The RTX 3060 was $329, and I bet even if you looked back and did the inflation math of the RTX 1660 and RTX 1060, I think you’ll find that $299 for a GPU is a pretty good price.”</p><p>Pricing and VRAM debates aside, the RTX 5060 will also be available in laptops in May. With prices starting at $1,099, Acer, Asus, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer will all have models with Nvidia’s latest RTX 5060 laptop GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in April 2025, including the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, a game you may have heard of. As announced previously, this return also brings with it the PC Game Pass debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-arrives-on-pc-game-pass-this-month-for-first-time-in-enhanced-edition">GTA 5's new Enhanced Edition for PC players</a> - the first time the game has been offered in any PC subscription service.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - the more recent one from 2022 - although you'll only be getting access to that, for now, if you have Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. It's the same deal as well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, the turn-based RPG from France that we've been keeping a hopeful eye on.</p>

As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Games getting the chop this time include Rebellion's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-5">Sniper Elite 5</a> and the Annapurna-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thirsty-suitors">Thirsty Suitors</a>. </p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 30th April are as follows:
</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was more than an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of Croteam's first-person philosophical puzzle-solving classic. It also included a whole new expansion for players, In the Beginning.</p>
<p>The new expansion includes 18 puzzles, 16 of which were made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858">in collaboration with a few of The Talos Principle's most dedicated fans</a> who'd been designing puzzles for years already. This is a key fact about this new expansion's development because these are some of the most challenging puzzles across the entire Talos Principle series. Who else besides the community's sickos (positive) could have designed them?</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through solving the puzzle Eclipse, which is located in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Eclipse Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that many of the components are only necessary for you to concern yourself with if you're trying to get the Gold Star.</p>
<p>If you want a big hint without looking at the rest of this guide for the solution, know that about half the puzzle area can be ignored if you want to grab the tetromino and be on your way. Another far more cryptic hint is that pause points and having items flying in the air while paused are part of how you solve this puzzle.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you've spent long enough trying to solve this on your own and now want the solution. Keep reading to see how this puzzle can be solved.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you first need to get the key to the locked door on the left side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Head towards the currently disabled barrier to the right. Grab the connector on the elevated step, connect it to the blue beam and the blue node immediately adjacent to each other, and place the connector to the left of the slightly elevated step. You should also angle it to stay connected to the node it was first connected to when you walked into the puzzle room. This will turn off the barrier, but a fan still blocks you from walking beyond the barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Turn around, and you will see a hexahedron (box) on a weighted switch to your right. Grab the box, and while standing slightly on the other side of the barrier that you've turned off, place the box on the elevated step to turn off the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the vent and use it on the weighted switch to turn off the barrier in front of you. Grab the box off the elevated step to allow the blue beam to re-connect, turning off the barrier on the left so both are off, and you can retrieve the fan. Grab it and place it down next to the box and connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring the box and the fan to the starting area, placing the fan on the vent on the ground to the right of the weighted switch in front of the puzzle entrance. Place the box on the weighted switch, activating the vent. Jump onto the vent to lift yourself in the air, and you'll see the keys on the platform in front of you. Jump on the platform to grab the keys.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>Now you have the keys to unlock the door and access the recorder. But you still need the connector, which is currently trapped on the wrong side of the barrier it is keeping disabled. This is where you'll start utilizing the recorder. Getting the connector on the right side of the barrier is the easy part. After that, it all gets much more complex. Let's start with getting the connector on the right side of the barrier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After unlocking the door with the keys, activate the recorder and create a pause point anywhere you like. Hit play on the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to the duplicated version of the connector in the recording, you can now grab the connector without disconnecting the beams when the recording pauses. Place the connector next to the vents and weighted switch in the puzzle entrance before letting the rest of the recording play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connector acquired. Here's where it gets trickier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red beam and the red node shown in the screenshot above. Place the connector down next to the vent.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start a new recording and grab the fan to use as a weight on the weighted switch on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red node, which you should be able to see through a window in the wall. Leave the connector there.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the weighted switch and place it back on the vent on the floor. After you've completed those actions, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the box, step on the weighted switch that activates the fans, and create another pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Drop the box on the fan directly in front of the weighted switch, and once it has reached its peak height, make another pause point. You can now walk over to the recorder and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>As your recording begins to play, pick up the fan again, place it on the same weighted switch you placed it on in the recording, and leave it there. Once your recorded self has placed the fan back on the vent and hit the first pause point, put the box on top of the fan while keeping it paused. Grab the connector, connect it to the duplicated recording version of the connector, and place the connector on the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With the recording still paused, head over to the left side of the puzzle room and beyond the purple barrier. Play the recording, and the blue barrier in front of you should be lifted once the box and the connector are in the air. The recording will pause again; don't unpause it until you've walked beyond the blue barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>At this point, you're nearly there. The barrier shield blocking your way to the tetromino should be lifted with the box and the connector in the air, but a fan blowing impedes you from walking to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Un-pause the recording again, and once everything is in the air, the duplicated recorded box should line up perfectly to block the red beam keeping the fan on, allowing you to grab the tetromino and complete the puzzle. It won't block the beam continuously, though, as the box with the connector on it bounces in the air. It's best to watch the box rise, and once you see it block the beam, make a break for the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll want to give the red beams enough time to properly activate each node, as long-time Talos Principle players know that nodes don't always activate immediately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-releases-free-color-blindness-tool-for-developers.1164639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released a free color blindness simulation tool to help developers understand how to make their games accessible to those with three major types of color blindness.</p>

<p>The tool's name is Chroma, and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/Chroma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as an open-source kit. It won't cost you anything to use it, either, so if you're a developer and you want to know how to make your game better for colorblind folks, Ubisoft's got you covered.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Ubisoft's official website, Chroma's purpose is to "accurately replicate" the experience of colorblind gamers and help developers to "create accessible content to meet [those players'] needs".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=aumZzukO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=xRgcz93m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft's Chroma color blindness tool is now free for all developers to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's accessibility director David Tisserand says Chroma has been a "highly efficient" tool for Ubisoft when developing its own games, and that he and his team believe "accessibility is a journey, not a race", which is why they're sharing Chroma with the wider industry.</p>

<p>Since Chroma is open-source, developers are welcome to "benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development", according to Tisserand. That's a pretty nice touch.</p>

<p>You can use Chroma on either single or dual screens, and it's hotkey-compatible as well. What's more, you can customize its overlay to make it look the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>QC product manager Jawad Shakil says Chroma was created to "mak[e] color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process", and that the Chroma team's work is "already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-2-accessibility.jpg?itok=NMhdk-ig 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-2-accessibility.jpg?itok=kya3ULOA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games, like&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, now ship with color blindness options.</figcaption></figure><p>More and more games are including extensive accessibility options at launch. Games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-showcases-expansive-last-of-us-part-1-accessibility-features" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part 1</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options" rel="nofollow">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a></em>, among many others,&nbsp;are launching with options like color blindness modes and audio descriptions, and titles that don't launch with these concessions often receive them as updates.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's color blindness tool Chroma is available to download and use right now for free.</p>

            <p>The GeForce RTX 50 series – Nvidia’s hated, adored, but never ignored family of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">gaming GPUs</a> – could soon be complete, as the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti have been specced out ahead of their imminent releases. These are mostly as-expected replacements for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-review">RTX 4060 Ti</a>, with moderate performance bumps augmented by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a>, though the RTX 5060 Ti is getting a lowered MSRP on both its 8GB and 16GB variants.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While there won't be a Founders Edition for any of these, partner versions of the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti will start from £349 / $379 - £40 / $20 less than the 8GB 4060 Ti. Base-price 16GB models, meanwhile, will shed £80 / $70 from the last-gen equivalent, selling at £399 / $429. Both are officially launching this Wednesday, April 16th, though an Nvidia spokesperson told digitally gathered reporters last week (myself included) that a lot of 8GB RTX 5060 Ti models might not actually go on sale until later on.</p>
<p>As for the RTX 5060, that’s sticking solely to 8GB, and will start at $299 (UK pricing TBC) when it has its own as-yet-unspecified release in May. The lack of extra VRAM over the RTX 4060 will likely keep it limited to 1080p duties, though that’s evidently not been a problem for the latter, which currently sits second on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam’s list of the most-used graphics cards</a>. Only after, funnily enough, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">RTX 3060</a>. It does use newer GDDR7 memory, though, as does the RTX 5060 Ti.</p>

<p>Here be some Nvidia-provided benchmark graphs to peer over, and yes, you <em>can</em> click to make them human eye-sized. Predictably, they count MFG’s AI-generated frames in amongst the traditionally rendered ones, which trickifies the business of making core performance comparisons against previous generations. Except, that is, in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>, which lacks MFG support and is thus comparable with the RTX 4060’s lowly 2x frame gen. Nvidia, you fools! Now it’s laid bare that, uh, both 5060 GPUs are about 20% faster over their 4060 counterparts, which doesn’t sound all that bad. Especially right after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">RTX 5070</a>, which is essentially just an RTX 4070 Super <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaOgZwk9rN8">with a new hat</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/RTX-5060-official-benchmarks.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frame generation remains as contentious a subject as the RTX 50 range itself, and to be honest, I’m still not sure how it’s perceived and used by the majority of ordinary players. Maybe you’d like to answer the poll below and educate me on that point. I will say that all frame gen systems – MFG, DLSS 3, FSR, the lot – work best when your PC is already churning out a healthy supply of ordinary frames, so cheaper GPUs like the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti might not be able to rely on them as much as a hulking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>. Here’s hoping the pre-generation framerate boost over the RTX 40 series is real, though obviously we have but the one rat-dodging stealth game for data points.</p>
<p>It's also unclear whether those (otherwise very agreeable) RTX 5060 Ti price drops will actually hold. Most of the previous RTX 50 GPU launches have been marred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5070-founders-editions-will-be-a-few-weeks-late-as-punters-and-sellers-brace-for-launch-day-shortages">stock shortages and resultant gouging</a>, and as the most mainstream-friendly of the pack, the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti seem especially vulnerable to instant sellouts. It's also too early to judge the impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-us-tariffs-hit-pc-hardware-is-joining-the-switch-2-in-pre-order-delay-limbo">US tariffs</a>: these were mostly paused/rolled back/wussed out of last week, though a base 10% tax remains, and Nvidia’s Taiwan-made GPUs aren’t counted among exemptions. Guess those <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2025/04/09/nvidia_us_export_ban_change/">$1m Mar-a-Lago dinners</a> only go so far.</p>

Images of what looks very much like that long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remake or remaster have leaked online care of Virtuos Games, the Singapore-based game developer reported to be handling the project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The pics were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">dug up</a> by enterprising Redditor Taurnil, who inspected a random element on <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/">the Virtuos Games website</a>, and wangled his way to a Wordpress folder containing a bunch of images labelled “Elder Scrolls IV” and “Oblivion”, which were uploaded just today (15th April). 
</p>
<p>
I’ve been able to retrace Taurnil’s steps and access said folder. It appears somebody has Virtuos has spotted the leak, because the images in question are no longer accessible, but the filenames are still there at the time of writing. I’ve asked Virtuos for comment.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, somebody else claims to have uploaded a few images to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a> – that's one of them up there in my article header. While they seem pretty credible, there is just the daintiest smidgeon of a ghostly possibility that they’ve been faked and posted for the lulz, so handle with caution. They show a few locations, including the Imperial City at Cyrodiil and a flaming Oblivion gate, together with a formal title, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.
</p>
<p>Is this just a remaster, then, or more of a remake? Earlier rumours have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">suggested</a> that the new version of Oblivion will make fairly robust changes to the original 2006 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking systems. Assuming all of this is legit, it doesn't sound like they've just bumped up the resolution.</p>
<p>
Oblivion remake gossip is currently at fever pitch, alleviated not at all by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">a chancy-sounding Bethesda support statement that “we have no official information on an Oblivion remake”</a>. If I were Bethesda and had an announcement trailer in the offing, I’d probably think about running it early at this stage.
