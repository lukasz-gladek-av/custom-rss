			<p>During a wide-ranging interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Variety</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer also discussed the success of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The executive appeared to hint at the potential for a sequel, but he also made it clear that he'd like Microsoft-owned studios to work first and foremost on owned franchises (which Indiana Jones is obviously not, being licensed by Disney).</p>
<p><em>I will say, we’re really happy with “Indy” and the players and the reception. We do think there’s life in that franchise, and I’m just gonna leave it at that. We’re launching on PlayStation here pretty soon. I think that’ll be a cool moment. I was really inspired by Machine Games taking someone else’s IP and doing something so unique, and I’m inspired about what that team can do next. Certain people were kind of pushing them on the first person versus third person. And I think once you play it, you realize you are Indy. But going forward, I also want to give the teams the ability to do our own games and our own franchises. We have a lot of room to tell new stories, as well. And I want to make sure that’s an option for us.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just launched on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, around four months after its debut on PC and Xbox Series S|X. PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers the best way to play the game on consoles</a>, although the PC version with path tracing enabled remains superior for those with the hardware to run it.</p>
<p>A story DLC called The Order of Giants is scheduled to be released later this year. Of course, a full-fledged sequel is what fans really want after playing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent base game</a>. It sounds like it could happen, provided that Disney reaches a deal with Microsoft.</p>

We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-season-2-drops-in-2025-but-firm-release-details-price-and-games-all-still-to-be-finalised">already knew it was coming</a>, but Playdate - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">cute boutique handheld console with the crank</a> - has just announced its second second of games, and one of those is a brand-new project from the massively acclaimed studio behind FTL and Into the Breach.
</p>
<p>
As announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4faUwfDw5o">during Playdate's latest showcase</a>, FTL developer Subset Games' <a href="https://play.date/games/fulcrum-defender/">Fulcrum Defender</a> is "totally different" to the studio's earlier titles, and sees players attempting to survive for as long as possible while holding back wave after wave of incoming enemies. Aiming utilises the crank as foes approach from all sides on the radar-like screen, with attack patterns growing more complex over time. As things progress, upgrades such as new weapons can be unlocked, with the key to survival being a "smart build and good aim".
</p>
<p>
"I wanted to make a replayable experience that starts off slow and relaxing, but gradually ramps up until it becomes frantic chaos," primary developer Jay Ma explained of Fulcrum Defender in today's Playdate announcement. "Originally I did not plan on finishing this game, I was making it as a form of self-therapy. I have been struggling with Long COVID... and I wanted to prove to myself that I could still make games in my current state."

<p>
Fulcrum Defender is one of 12 new games coming to Playdate as part of Season Two, with three more having so far been revealed in detail. There's developer Pixel Ghost's <a href="https://play.date/games/shadowgate-pd/">Shadowgate PD</a>, for instance, which reimagines the classic point-and-click adventure series with new music, art, and features. It follows players - in the role of The Seed of Prophecy - as they travel deep into the titular living castle in a bid to defeat the evil Warlock Lord who resides there.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside <a href="https://play.date/games/taria-and-como/">Taria &amp; Como</a>, a physics-based puzzle platformer built around swinging rather than jumping. Developed by Popseed Studio Inc and JuVee Productions, it charts the adventures of Taria, a young girl with a prosthetic leg, who sets out to rescue her sister Como in a world that constantly underestimates her.
</p>
<p>
And finally for the full reveals, there's <a href="https://play.date/games/dig-dig-dino/">Dig! Dig! Dino!</a>, from Dom 2D (Flinthook) &amp; Fáyer (Arco). This one casts players as a crew of palaeontologists in a game about digging for dinosaurs bones, analysing strange artefacts, and uncovering long-buried secrets. "Sell off coins and treasure to build an arsenal of digging tools," explains its announcement, "then upgrade them to go deeper and find even more bones and loot!"
</p>
<p>
Playdate's second season <a href="http://play.date/games">costs $39 USD</a> and will see two of its 12 included games release each week between 29th May and 3rd July. There's also a tease for a "must-see surprise" that'll be "something a little different". Season Two's remaining eight games will be properly revealed at a later date, but their titles and developers have been announced as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chance's Lucky Escape - Developed by Goloso Games (Spike II: The Great Emu War) and Julia</li>
<li>Minamata (The Crimson Diamond)</li>
<li>Otto's Galactic Groove - Developed by Team Otto (Skwish)</li>
<li>Catchadiablos - Developed by Amano Games (Pullfrog Deluxe)</li>
<li>The Whiteout - Developed by Scenic Route Software (Post Hero, Generations)</li>
<li>Black Hole Havoc - Developed by Cosmic Bros (Jolly Chimp Champ)</li>
<li>Wheelsprung - Developed by Nino van Hooff (Gravity Express) and Julie Bjørnskov (Escape the Arcade)</li>
<li>Tiny Turnip - Developed by Luke Sanderson (Paper Pilot)</li>
<li>Long Puppy - Developed by Indiana-Jonas (Surmount)</li>
<li>▀▄▀▄▀▄ - Developed by Dustin Mierau (Playmaker, Path, Napster)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you haven't yet picked up a Playdate, they're now <a href="http://shop.play.date/">readily available on creator Panic Inc's store</a> for $229 USD, with refurbished units costing $179. A new cover in the same shade of yellow as the Playdate has also been released for $34 - just be aware those prices don't include shipping or taxes, which can be pretty substantial outside the US.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-otk-lost-its-way.1167084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When OTK – short for One True King – was founded in 2020, it was far from the first streamer conglomerate/production company/lifestyle brand to plant its flag, but what it had going for it was its unique mix of personalities. Where the likes of 100 Thieves and FaZe Clan began with feet firmly in the esports world, and others like the once-Pokimane-fronted OfflineTV prided themselves on cozy wholesomeness, OTK was the result of Twitch’s edgelord past meeting its brand-friendly present. Having Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo, Tim "Esfand" Esfandiari, and Rich Campbell on the starting bench as owners lent the organization an authentically messy appeal. Flash forward five years, though, and OTK is facing an uncertain future. Streamers were its greatest asset, but they’ve also proven to be its biggest stumbling block.</p><p>At the tail end of last year, OTK <a href="https://x.com/OvileeMay/status/1870219477100703982?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off employees</a> working in production, sales, and marketing, reducing full-time headcount from around twenty to around five, according to former OTK employees, whom Aftermath granted anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on these matters. This was the culmination of an arc that began promisingly, with ambitious ideas from streamers, behind-the-scenes staff, and Tips Out (the organization’s fifth co-founder and main strategic mind), but which ultimately descended into public-facing scandals and conflicting priorities on the part of some of the aforementioned streamers, who also co-owned the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s really about accountability, right?” a former OTK employee told Aftermath. “When you have creators that are owners in the organization, you can't tell them anything. You can't do anything.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to OTK multiple times in the weeks before this report’s publishing. The company declined to comment on most of what follows. An OTK spokesperson told Aftermath: “OTK's vision and business model remains the same as it has for the past several years: to be the best influencer-led gaming brand in digital. We continue pursuing this endeavor each and every day.”</p><h2>The Power Of Friendship</h2><p>OTK’s earliest days were characterized by a palpable sense of fun. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSTRk9IUyeU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2020 video</a> introducing the collective to fans, Hoyt outlined his vision: "We came up with this idea of making an org and building an org around our friends – and building the org around friendship in general." Streams and videos suggested that he and his fellow mostly-<em>World of Warcraft</em> streamers had, indeed, figured out how to monetize their friendship. There was a shenanigans-laden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aFIzyQWLA8&amp;t=922s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friendsgiving</a>, a <em>Pokémon </em>card-powered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjfTq_mf8to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charity drive</a>, a (purposefully) budget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlX_tGl9aKc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pro wrestling show</a>, and eventually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z08svBFA3U&amp;t=674s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a content house</a>. Over time, additional members like Nick “Nmplol” Polom, Chance “Sodapoppin” Morris, Emily "Emiru" Schunk, Emily "ExtraEmily" Zhang, and Will Neff joined as well, though not all in ownership capacities.</p><p>The vibe of OTK’s initial events was often loose and low-stakes. Streamers drank and laughed. Living spaces were cluttered. Camera angles were awkward. Overlays were minimal. OTK’s streamers made it feel like they were messing around and somebody just so happened to leave a camera in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="What is OTK? ft. Asmongold, Mizkif, Esfand, Rich Campbell, Tips Out" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSTRk9IUyeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But OTK was still very much a business, one founded by creators who’d spent their careers regularly behaving in ways that were not brand-friendly, but which was intended to cause brands to see dollar signs and feel an overwhelming urge to slap their logos on the organization’s content.</p><p>"You had Nick, Mizkif, and Asmon collaborate on stream, and you had, like, 57,000 people watching,” one former OTK employee told Aftermath. “You're like 'This is a goldmine to monetize.’ Any brand would be absolutely over the moon to have those kinds of numbers. And obviously it was during the covid age of Twitch, where we saw the big [viewership] boom. So it was a match made in heaven. … [OTK] wanted to make events and monetize these streams where they can put all their brands together, and it can yield insane budgets – getting clearance for six, almost seven-figure budgets for shows or episodes or stuff like that."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It was a match made in heaven.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Over time, this meant that OTK had to professionalize. Brands didn’t necessarily want to attach their names to messy rooms and wanton weirdness. They wanted to be part of a polished product.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you scale up to these businesses, when you're asking them for more money, they're pitching it in front of their CEO, CMO, VP of marketing, etc,” the former OTK employee said. “The way [OTK's content] looked back then, it just didn't look appealing. [Brands aren’t] going to commit money to this when you're competing against TV, traditional media buying, and all that stuff [where] everything's well polished."</p><p>So, in some cases, OTK upped its production values. It leaned on consistent formats like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OifbsgAeCDk&amp;list=PLKm9gGMelbSjtSbcsAKZo00ViCfCrEErX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schooled</a>, in which star-studded streamer lineups competed to answer questions based on knowledge they should have acquired in school, and sold brands not just on mid-episode placements but season-long sponsorships, social media clips, ad reads, newsletter mentions, and more. Big-name brands like Coinbase, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, Razer, Intel, and eventually Progressive latched onto the nascent venture.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ESFAND THERE'S JUST NO WAY - OTK ft. MitchJones, Jinny and more..! #ad" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlX_tGl9aKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Then 2022 saw two major scandals rock the org: In September of that year, Rinaudo was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363760/mizkif-trainwreckstv-sexual-harassment-twitch-adrianahlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of covering up</a> a sexual assault incident between two other streamers, and OTK <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1572387360247271427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended him</a> pending the results of a third-party investigation. In a <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1609361988467183616/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> in December, OTK wrote that the investigation “did not find direct evidence that Mizkif attempted to minimize or cover up sexual assault as alleged.” The statement also noted that Rinaudo had <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1579588035595075585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly</a> demonstrated a "callous disregard towards the severity of sexual misconduct and racial prejudice in our space" and would remain off OTK’s board of directors until "he demonstrates to the board that he is capable of upholding our organization's values.” Aftermath reached out to Rinaudo to ask whether or not he’d been reinstated but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2022, Campbell, another founder, <a href="https://x.com/RichWCampbell/status/1603869600969547785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resigned from OTK</a> following <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/what-allegations-former-otk-co-founder-rich-campbell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual assault allegations</a>. He more or less disappeared off the internet until 2024, at which point news broke that he’d <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/rich-campbell-files-3-6m-defamation-lawsuit-over-sexual-assault-allegations-2458787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a defamation suit against one of his accusers for $3.6 million</a> in damages after she sued him. Aftermath reached out to Campbell’s lawyer for more details about the current status of the case but did not receive a reply.</p><p>Smaller controversies also took place in 2022, like Hoyt <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/breaking-asmongold-s-2022-5-month-hiatus-getting-banned-alternate-channel-controversies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting suspended from Twitch</a> for what the platform called "hateful and unmoderated conduct" in his <em>Diablo Immortal</em> chat. Even the sorts of events that felt tailormade to attract sponsors – for example, the annual OTK Expo, which began in 2022 as an attempt at a more scripted-and-staged, prim-and-proper video game showcase – ultimately suffered as a result of scandals, according to ex-OTK staff.</p><p>"We cared deeply about indie games, indie developers, and the people in the industry,” a former OTK employee told Aftermath of the OTK Expo. “[But] there's a lot of sponsors that just straight up didn't want to work with us after the Mizkif stuff, after Asmongold's first incident."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The first thing any brand safety person from any of these big Fortune 500 brands sees when they type out OTK is sexual assault.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"[Allegations are] an absolutely soul-crushing thing for any sales person or marketing person trying to pitch a brand,” another former OTK employee told Aftermath. “The first thing any brand safety person from any of these big Fortune 500 brands sees when they type out OTK is sexual assault. Pitching that would be putting themselves in the crossfire of 'Why are you even here at this job if you're not flagging this early on?' So slowly, it became very difficult for OTK to sell itself [to brands]. … And the more you're spending with a brand, the more money you're asking, the more due diligence happens with a brand."</p><p>In 2022, the organization also began to expand. With Tips Out, who’d previously founded and run a <em>World of Warcraft</em> esports company called Classic Dueler’s League, leading the charge, the minds behind OTK started a sister company: Starforge Systems, which specialized in gaming PCs. Two more followed shortly after in 2023: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otk-network-launches-indie-game-and-publishing-company-mad-mushroom-301847679.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Mashroom</a>, an indie game publisher that, on paper, synergized nicely with the OTK Expo, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otk-network-unveils-newest-collaboration-with-creator-centric-talent-management-company-301757576.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythic Talent</a>, a creator management company that now counts among its roster stars like Case “Caseoh” Baker, as well as OTK mainstays like Hoyt, Rinaudo, and Morris. Starforge and Mythic went on to become successful businesses in their own rights.</p><p>"[OTK’s issues] make it really hard to build a sustainable business, which I think is why OTK has diversified so many times into a PC company, talent management company, and a video game publisher,” a former OTK employee told Aftermath. “It was like 'Hey, we can use OTK as this tip of the spear, a marketing campaign into the parts of the industry that are typically really low margin, and if we don't spend anything on marketing, that can actually increase our margin.’"</p><p>The official OTK spokesperson took a similar, albeit sunnier view of the company’s strategy: “In many ways, OTK is the nucleus that supercharges all of our other entities. Through our content, brand, and corporate support, OTK helps establish new businesses in a fraction of the time it would normally take.”</p><h2><strong>There’s No “I” In Stream</strong></h2><p>As time went on, another difficulty arose: Streamers began to lose interest. Former OTK employees characterized this as less of an individual issue, like the controversies, and more of a systemic problem. Livestreaming does not incentivize long-term planning and collaboration; rather, streamers are taught by the never-ending Groundhog Day loop of viewer numbers, subscriptions, and donations to hyperfixate on the here and now. Which trends should you chase to keep your channel’s numbers up? How should you capitalize on a big moment? What’s going to benefit you more: slowly and meticulously contributing to a team effort or betting on yourself?&nbsp;</p><p>"Initially, the creators thought [OTK] was fun, like 'Oh, I'll do a show here, do a show there.' And then suddenly it's like 'We need you to do a show every other week.' That creator's not happy,” said an ex-OTK employee. “So it was painful! Sometimes we would have a show, expected deliverables with talent, and [a creator’s] excuse was 'I don't want to show up. I have sponsored stuff [on my own channel].' And what quickly happened was, creators realized they could just say no, and there was no accountability."</p><figure><blockquote><p>What quickly happened was, creators realized they could just say no.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Since many of OTK’s creators also co-owned the company, they couldn’t be fired or meaningfully reprimanded for no-showing OTK programming. This, according to ex-employees, was exacerbated by the fact that while creators who did not partially own OTK were paid a salary, OTK did not directly compensate creator-owners for OTK projects but instead offered them a mix of brand deals, equity in the company, cuts of sponsorships, ad revenue, and services provided by staff (graphics for a show, help starting up a new podcast, marketing assistance, etc).&nbsp;</p><p>"They had all these utilities and all these resources,” said an ex-OTK employee. “Oh, you want to start a podcast? Perfect. We'll do it all for you. We'll only take a portion of the ad revenue [and/or] sponsorship revenue from any of the deals we've signed. So there were a lot of freemium benefits for all the creators at OTK."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Put 14 Streamers On A Real Ranch!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDADGM7NOA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a result, ex-employees say, streamers continued to use these perks to benefit their personal brands after their excitement for the organization cooled.</p><p>"So what happened, especially this past year [2024], is creators realized that they were raking in money on their own individual deals: game deals, smaller brand activations, shows,” said the ex-OTK employee. “Absolutely enormous amounts of money. 'Why should I care [about OTK] when OTK doesn't compensate me for any of those things?’ [was basically how they approached it].”</p><p>Another ex-OTK employee pointed to Polom as an example of this phenomenon. Outside of a project that was considered his baby – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpRYRqpby1Lp7FjamW9XAy4J4J8_zsnl8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild West</a>, a large-scale IRL stream that saw 14 streamers role-play as cowboys on a real ranch – he increasingly focused on his own channel over time. To an extent, the ex-employee understood where Polom was coming from.</p><p>"[Polom] focused more on his own stream because it blew up, and he's not interested in working in advertised events for OTK, because that's more or less what it was becoming,” said the ex-employee. “People were calling OTK 'AdTK,' because every single event we were doing was sponsored by some game, some show, some whatever."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Polom for more details, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>But former employees say streamers weren’t exactly turning up their noses at ads either.</p><p>"They complained about us having so many advertised and sponsored shows, yet these creators could easily self-fund a lot of these shows and not have sponsors on them, but they chose not to,” said an ex-OTK employee. “These creators had the option for their shows to be white label, sponsor free, no ads – to give their community what they want. And they chose not to. ... They didn't have to lose any money to put on the show. [The creators] were making money from sponsors and then not following their own sponsorship deliverables."</p><figure><blockquote><p>People were calling OTK 'AdTK,' because every single event we were doing was sponsored by some game, some show, some whatever.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The problem, as one ex-OTK employee sees it, is that streamers didn’t understand what they had.</p><p>"We'd say 'Hey, [group of creators], we're giving you all a $10,000 opportunity to play a game. We were able to work it out with a publisher,’” said a former OTK employee. “What did they do after we held their hand through the entire process? … [OTK staff] didn't get a thank you. Didn't get anything. It became another routine thing. It's very weird how this evolution of rhetoric within the company from the creators became 'I'm not being compensated. I'm not benefiting' even though they had a ton of shares, equity in the company, and they're getting brand deals out the wazoo."</p><p>Events that aired on streamers’ personal channels – rather than central OTK channels – stood to benefit streamers even more.&nbsp;</p><p>"OTK never took any ad revenue from any of Mizkif’s streams when all these big events were running,” said the former OTK employee. “We never took sub percentages. We never took donations. So these creators were given a full big spotlight that drew massive amounts of attention and awareness to them for free, and we never took anything other than a percentage of the brand deals that came through."</p><p>What OTK did take, former staff say, went where you’d expect it to: paychecks and production.</p><p>"You have to make a margin, you have to pay people a livable wage,” said the former employee. “Give it to OTK: We were well compensated compared to most gaming production companies/media companies out there. I'll give it to Tips and the team for doing that."</p><p>“Production cost was mostly where cost and spend went,” the former employee added. “Salaries played their role, but production costs were crazy at times.”</p><p>Staff felt frustrated when they would bring a project fully to term, only for creators to drop the ball at the eleventh hour.</p><p>"We would have a merch drop,” said a former OTK employee. “We would go through a very tough refinement period of getting feedback, making sure the creators are really happy with it, and we're like 'Alright, it's time to launch. This is your merch. This is everything you guys wanted. You designed it.' And it was like pulling teeth to get them to promote it. This is their stuff! But they don't want to make a post about their merchandise."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Somebody else would have to go onto their accounts and pin things in the chat, promote or push from their accounts, push from their Reddit, post on their social media channels.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"Year three, it was very obvious that creators were checked out,” said another ex-OTK employee. “It was a nightmare to get any deliverables done, to get them to post, to promote the shows. You probably saw it all the time: People are like 'Oh, I didn't even hear about this show. The creators didn't even talk about it blah, blah, blah.' Somebody else would have to go onto their accounts and pin things in the chat, promote or push from their accounts, push from their Reddit, post on their social media channels."</p><p>To an extent, this makes sense: As I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/stream-big-book-excerpt-twitch-dream-face-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written a whole book about</a>, streaming is a more taxing job than people give it credit for. Those at the top of the food chain are constantly juggling daily streams, YouTube channels, TikToks, Instagrams, collaborations, travel, and more. They regularly burn out. It’s not surprising that some decided to shake a burdensome weight off their shoulders when they saw an opportunity.</p><p>"I think a lot of people just want what's simpler, what they know and what is going to [put them on the path of least resistance]. It’s a very natural instinct we all have,” said an ex-OTK employee. “[Creators’] core product, their core business, which is their own streams, they're all crushing it. … A lot was great working with these creators and having them invested in the day-to-day business stuff, but the lack of communication skills, organization structure stuff for these creators was absolutely a fucking mess sometimes."&nbsp;</p><p>Another pointed out that not all creators treated OTK events the same way. Some participated more than others. "ExtraEmily was super active. Cyr was great," the ex-staffer said, referencing two OTK creators who are not owners.</p><h2><strong>The Asmongold Problem</strong></h2><p>Then late 2024 arrived, and Hoyt, who’d begun consistently banging the anti-DEI drum to his millions of viewers <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the year prior</a>, made his radicalization impossible to ignore by going on <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a racist rant against Palestinians</a> in October, calling them “inferior” and adding that “I’m not going to cry a fucking river when people who have genocide that’s baked into their laws are getting genocided.” The entire Twitch community was taken aback, and even Tips Out <a href="https://x.com/TipsOut/status/1846302400988303489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a statement</a> breaking with his fellow co-owner’s “dehumanizing” stance. Twitch suspended Hoyt, and he apologized for his statements shortly after. At the time, he also stepped away from leadership duties at OTK, Starforge, and Mad Mushroom.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in the months that followed, the overall tenure of Hoyt’s broadcasts did not change. After Trump got reelected in November, Hoyt leaned further into far-right politics. Some remaining sponsors opted to abandon ship.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Why would you want to be part of an indie game show when Asmongold just spouts about DEI all the time?</p></blockquote></figure><p>"Asmongold's comments on the Middle East were kinda the nail in the coffin for [for those of us who got laid off],” said an ex-OTK employee. “It was a really tricky situation because, yes, Asmongold is entitled to his opinion, beliefs, whatever he thinks, but when you are the owner, founder of a company that you publicly own, and there's people that work at it, it impacts what you say. You're no longer the only one at it."</p><p>"Why would you want to be part of an indie game show when Asmongold just spouts about DEI all the time? It's very contradictory,” said another ex-OTK employee, referencing the OTK Expo. “It just sucks that Asmongold became so radicalized, because he [was] the owner of the company. ... Even if you do believe all this stuff, which is completely fine, you have some sort of responsibility as a creator to not be so radical. I mean, you guys are toying with my job, you know?"</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="My Plans Moving Forward" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSI-N-QHNTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the months that followed, OTK associates like Schunk <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-just-stop-collaborating-asmongold-fans-react-emiru-talks-issuing-apology-working-people-said-sh-ty-things" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced backlash for associating with Hoyt</a>, while big streamers like Cinna <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-cinna-talks-nmplol-asmongold-s-recent-controversial-opinions-insinuates-emiru-otk-members-cut-ties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Schunk and others should cut ties with him.</p><p>In November 2024, another divisive creator who’d joined OTK in 2021, Tectone, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-tectone-announces-resigned-otk-days-former-girlfriend-pinkchyu-accused-sexual-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resigned</a> following sexual abuse allegations. When layoffs hit the company in December, employees say they hadn’t been explicitly warned they were coming, but given the year OTK had endured, some felt it was only a matter of time.</p><p>“The writing was on the wall,” said one ex-OTK employee.</p><p>"The money just kind of dried up, and to protect the other subsidiaries, people had to get let go,” said another, who added that they remain proud of what the organization was able to accomplish, despite all the difficulties. “I think we put on some of the best shows ever on Twitch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpRYRqpby1Lp7FjamW9XAy4J4J8_zsnl8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild West</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA1xMBDTGnE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melee II and III</a>. We put on an MMA show that was unlike anything we've ever seen before [on Twitch]."&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, OTK’s future is uncertain. Hoyt <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/asmongold-reveals-that-he-has-officially-left-otk-amid-changes-to-org-3141010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> during a February 2025 broadcast that he is no longer involved with OTK “at all, pretty much.” He went on to explain that his “extreme” and “polarizing” political content played a major role – and that it did, indeed, make it “harder to find sponsors.”&nbsp;</p><p>"I also don't want to put anybody else at risk by doing that,” he said during the stream. “So that's why I separated myself and I didn't want to have anything to do with that. This is a mutual thing, right? And, even if it wasn't, I still would agree with them."</p><figure><blockquote><p>The writing was on the wall.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But by that point, a measurable amount of damage had already been done: People had already lost their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the departures of Hoyt, Campbell, and others, OTK’s lineup of owners now looks quite different than it did when it started, with Esfandiari, Rinaudo, Tips Out, Polom, Morris, and Schunk listed as owners, while others, like variety streamers Cyr and Will Neff, are simply content creators under the organization. (Hoyt declined to comment on whether or not he’s still a stakeholder in the organization.) Now OTK is rebuilding. The company is set to host <a href="https://x.com/OTKGamesExpo/status/1890098673117479204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another OTK Expo</a> in May. It might end up looking similar to those of previous years, as it will be filmed in the same studio. But behind the scenes, the latest iteration is leaning on contractors – a few of whom used to be OTK employees – instead of a full production team. It’s unclear how many sponsors the show will be able to attract.</p><p>The most notable motion out of OTK this year has been the establishment of yet another spinoff, a marketing company called Cross Realm Inc. Cross Realm has already <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/20/3046162/0/en/KICK-Announces-KICK-Partner-Fast-Track-Program-with-OTK-Subsidiary-Cross-Realm-Inc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brokered a deal with gambling-powered Twitch rival Kick</a> to fast-track streamers through the platform’s application process. "At the end of the day, Kick has the cash, and OTK needs it," said an ex-OTK employee.&nbsp;</p><p>Bigger changes are coming, both in front of and behind the camera.</p><p>“Just know that we’re trying to make changes to make [OTK] a better org, and you’ll probably hear more about that in the future, the immediate future," Neff, who joined OTK in 2024, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/otk-member-reveals-huge-changes-coming-to-org-amid-asmongold-drama-3133678/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> during a February stream. "And if we can’t make it a better place, if we can’t make it a happier, healthier place, then I’ll have to reevaluate where I stand.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="(1/2) FEB/15/'25 'Its the weekend and so its time to come all over this kingdom'" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KVI352C-VY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>During a March stream, Rinaudo downplayed both his role in what remains of OTK and OTK as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>“We don’t do anything,” he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/mizkif-opens-up-about-his-future-in-otk-as-company-restructures-after-asmongold-drama-3159568/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> in response to a viewer question about whether he’d stick around following Hoyt’s departure. “Why would I leave? For what? Another org? There’s no point. I think OTK is just more so a group of content creators nowadays, more so than it is anything else. It’s not really an org.”</p><p>This fits with the changing economics of livestreamed events. Where once organizations like OTK, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/09/27/ludwig-youtube-twitch-offbrand-agency-xqc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ludwig Ahgren’s Offbrand</a>, signaled the rise of a Twitch meta built around glitzy productions, reality – known primarily for its harshness and pretty much nothing else – had other plans. Offbrand Productions launched in 2022 to help other creators roll out the sorts of ambitious, almost television-like bonanzas that helped Ahgren’s star ascend, but it shut down in December 2024. “Our people worked hard and made amazing content, but we failed to make the events business sustainable," Offbrand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LudwigAhgren/comments/1hdsghe/offbrand_productions_shut_down_offbrand_games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote at the time</a>. Former OTK employees couldn’t help but feel sympathy pangs.&nbsp;</p><p>“You even saw Offbrand, they tried to give it an entire go, and they ran into the same things,” said one ex-OTK employee. “I know the exact same feeling that they felt. A lot of brands got smarter, too. They realized 'Cool, you guys are pulling in a lot of viewers, but it's just not the same.' The conversion isn't there for a lot of brands."&nbsp;</p><p>Skyrocketing viewership numbers, brands have come to realize, look nice, but in the world of livestreaming, bigger isn’t necessarily better.</p><p>“Does it really help that Asmongold is the one trying to market a cute, cozy indie game, or that Tectone is the one trying to sell a PC? Maybe it does for the first six months,” said a former OTK employee. “But beyond that, it's actually probably more harmful than it is helpful.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I think OTK will transform to a similar capacity that [Cenat's] AMP is and FaZe Clan is and Offline TV is. It's a name for a group rather than a company.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Some ex-OTK employees think we’ve already caught a glimpse of the future. Events are thriving on Twitch, but in some ways, the new breed harkens back more to the low-budget-looking chaos of OTK’s early content than to the productions of the AdTK era. Kai Cenat, a streamer so popular that he’s crossed over into the mainstream, made his name on <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-kai-cenat-therapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game marathons</a> that required little more than a few cameras and a room. Admittedly, as he’s grown, he’s leveled up his approach with high-budget commercials and a mind-bogglingly deep roster of celebrities, but others have applied a more modest version of his formula <a href="https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to impressive success</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think creators will copy Kai Cenat and his subathon kind of structure, where they'll invest in a singular room setup,” said an ex-OTK employee. “Extravagant plans, things that are usually run by a group, they'll outsource it. Even something like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/after-losing-his-father-to-cancer-mega-streamer-shroud-is-running-a-january-fragathon-where-hell-donate-to-cancer-research-for-each-in-game-kill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shroud's Fragathon</a>, we'll see those, and they'll be around. I think we'll just see a lot less of 'Every quarter, a new game show, etc.’ … I think OTK will transform to a similar capacity that [Cenat's] AMP is and FaZe Clan is and Offline TV is. It's a name for a group rather than a company."&nbsp;</p><p>"There is a huge production team and a huge production budget behind a lot of Kai Cenat's subathons and events,” said another ex-OTK employee. “They're just tucked away in a different room, doing cams, doing [operations]. But I think the audience has shifted away from shows. When you're watching Kai in his bedroom and he's doing a cool event, it's like you're hanging out with a friend. It's like you're there. … We didn't adapt to the audience. We just kept doing what we had been doing for the past four years, and the market changed, and we were behind it."</p><p>OTK, then, was a learning experience for all involved, in both personal and professional senses.</p><p>"I'm a very long-time viewer and member of these communities, so when I first got hired at OTK, it was somewhat of an honor for me to end up working for these guys,” said a former OTK employee. “I really thought it was going to be something different. It was bittersweet."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date and trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">Star Wars Outlaw's</a> next DLC expansion, A Pirate's Fortune, have leaked online ahead of its scheduled reveal during Star Wars Celebration tomorrow, with the currently unlisted trailer appearing on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-reveal-trailer-launches-on-may-15th.1167036/">ResetEra</a>. Since publishing, Ubisoft has taken the trailer down.</p>
<p>Both the trailer and the video's description spoil the surprise that players will be able to step back into the boots of Kay Vess and experience an adventure with fan-favorite character Hondo Ohnaka on <strong>May 15, 2025</strong>, with the DLC including its own season pass, just as the first DLC, Wild Card, did.</p>
<p>A press release from Ubisoft also reveals that a demo for Star Wars Outlaws will be made available starting today on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The demo will be approximately three hours long, featuring "<em>parts</em>" of the full game, hinting that you'll likely get to jump around in the game's story so you can experience major aspects like open-world exploration, ship battles, and stealth missions. Save data from the demo will not carry over to the full game, should you choose to pick it up.</p>
<p>The new expansion will also feature cosmetic items inspired by the recent television series Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a trophy for the speeder, and trinkets for your speeder and Kay's ship, the Trailblazer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This new trailer doesn't reveal too much about the story for A Pirate's Fortune, only that you'll be pitted against Stinger Tash and her band of Rokana Raiders while you race against them to do a bit of tomb raiding in the Khepi Tomb.</p>
<p>A Pirate's Fortune is the second of two planned DLCs for Star Wars Outlaws, after which Ubisoft is likely to announce that it has moved on to future projects, especially when considering that, by Ubisoft's admission, Outlaws did not have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">commercial performance</a> Ubisoft was expecting from it.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
 "The next project set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> universe" is even now in production, developers 11 bit have <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/">revealed</a> in their latest annual financial results. Whether it be known as Frostpunk 3, Fro3tpunk, Frostpunk: Revengeance, or some other variation of Frostpunkage, it could launch "as early as 2027". 11 bit have also begun development of a "larger-scale title", which they're hoping to release in 2029. 
</p>
<p>
The financial results paint a mixed picture of 11 bit's fortunes in 2024 - hence the decision to bejazzle the investors with talk of another Frostpunk game. On the one hand, 11 bit have experienced "the highest sales in the company's history", driven by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>'s release and legacy sales of Frostpunk and This War Of Mine. On the other, there hasn't been a "corresponding increase" in profit margins, mostly thanks to the cancellation of Project 8, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-developers-share-new-details-of-project-8-their-ill-fated-fantasy-game-about-grieving">a third-person fantasy adventure with a theme of working through grief</a>. 
</p>
<p>
11 bit have also seen some disappointments in their publishing division: historical RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-thaumaturge">The Thaumaturge</a> and Pied Piper sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures of Ava</a> have "failed to resonate with gamers", though the experimental satire <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a> has apparently done rather well.
</p>
<p>
Frostpunk 2's initially strong showing, meanwhile, has been blunted by mixed player reviews. "We hope that upcoming DLCs, including new gameplay features, will improve the ratings Frostpunk 2 has received from players," CEO Przemysław Marszał comments in the release. (Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review">Frostpunk 2 review</a> summed it up as "an atmospheric, bold attempt to reinvent its own society-moulding subgenre whose story and building features too often frustrate with too few options or distract with too many.") 
</p>
<p>
11 bit have some larger hunks of coal in the boiler this year. On the publishing front, there's Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, "a sequel to the company's most successful third-party title to date", in which you must farm dungeons for goodies to flog in your village store. There's Death Howl, which some oaf who can't be arsed to think of a new description <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bits-latest-curiosity-death-howl-is-a-sorrowing-open-world-deckbuilder-set-in-the-nordic-stone-ages">once described</a> as "a sorrowing open world deckbuilder set in the Nordic Stone Ages". As for in-house games: 11 bit's big bet this year is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>, in which one man and his many clones must collaborate to operate a rolling spacebase.
</p>
<p>
It's a while away, but: hopes for the next Frostpunk? At the risk of getting myself thrown off a glacier by the faithful, I wonder if it might be time for a change of genre. Perhaps a party-based RPG, like Wartales, with players scouring the icelocked crannies of New London for firewood.

But after over more than 46 years of being locked away in a temperature-controlled tomb in England, the public will get to see the first cut, a special, extra-colorful and well-preserved “dye-transfer imbibition” print of the movie, and George Lucas likely won’t be too happy about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,194499,196842" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/star-wars-original-print-george-lucas-bfi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Film Institute’s Film on Film Festival</a></span> will open in June with a screening of a rare Technicolor film print of the original <em>Star Wars</em> film that was released during its initial run in Britain. While it has been released on home video, this will be the first time the public will be able to watch it in theaters since December 1978. If Lucas had it his way, the world would probably have never seen it.<br></p><p>George Lucas has been tinkering with <em>Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope </em>for years, attempting to revamp the film with additional scenes here, a new opening sequence there, and a slew of special effects changes. The first changes happened in 1981, when a new cut with the subtitle added replaced the 1977 original print. Since then, Lucas has spent decades avoiding being beholden to his first attempt at his magnum opus. Since 1997, theaters have only been permitted to screen the rejigged, updated version. To Lucas, the version the British Film Institute will be screening “is not very good,” and he won’t acknowledge its existence.</p><p>“The Special Edition, that’s the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it’s on VHS, if anybody wants it. I’m not going to spend the—we’re talking millions of dollars here—the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn’t really exist anymore,” Lucas told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-original-cut-edit-screening-george-lucas-1236191847/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>Associated Press</em></a></span> in 2004. “It’s like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I’m sorry you saw a half-completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Lucasfilm and Disney gave permission to the BFI to screen the original print of the <em>Star Wars</em> film. He may believe “a film belongs to its creator,” according to what he told the audience during his masterclass seminar at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. But, when you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell your company</a></span> for $4 billion, you quickly learn it does not. After the two screenings at the BFI Film on Film Festival, the movie is “going straight back to the Master Film Store and those sub-zero conditions” which maintained the film’s pristine quality over the decades, according to BFI National Archive’s Senior Curator of Fiction and Programme Director of the festival James Bell.</p><p>The festival will open on June 12 in London.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the moment I saw the Charizard ex Super Premium Collection on sale, something in my brain short-circuited. My body? Fully ready for yet <em>another</em> unnecessary purchase. And at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXRm6?object_uuid=d18afbef-ba9c-4fc0-b09c-5dbe79fed3de&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">under $50, this box is stacked</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re getting a foil Charizard ex promo, plus matching Charmander and Charmeleon to complete the fiery trio. There’s even a Charizard display figure (because, of course, there is), and—get this—ten booster packs. Not five. Not six. Ten. That’s ten chances to pull something ridiculous. </p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218886"><div id="218886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Charizard ex Super Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes packs from Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, Paradox Rift, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames—some of the most exciting recent drops in the TCG lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you further in your quest for great pulls, here are some of my favorite chase cards from these Pokémon TCG sets. Or, if you're done with chasing singles in boosters and fancy just picking up a couple of single cards instead of splashing out on this deal, I've included some handy offers from TCG Player to make sure you're getting the best price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Twilight Masquerade Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I want Perrin and Hisuian Growlithe purely for the art. GIDORA nailed the emotional bond between a Trainer and her Pokémon, and the way the two illustrations pair up makes pulling just one feel like an incomplete thought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Dragapult ex is is terrifyingly efficient and might be the best Pokémon ex in the set. Carmine is the real money card here though, continuing the trend of playable, stylish Trainer cards dominating the top of the market. Throw in cozy Eevee vibes and a surprisingly playable Ursaluna, and you’ve got a set with range.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Stellar Crown Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Crown is what happens when nostalgia and artistry shake hands. Squirtle and Bulbasaur show off their bird-watching hobbies in some of the most charming cards I’ve seen in years. Then there’s Terapagos ex, which looks like it belongs in a jewelry store, not a binder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hydrapple and Dachsbun are slightly more niche but still desirable thanks to lush illustrations and just enough playability to make you think twice before selling. I think this set knows what it's doing: hook you with Kanto starters, then keep you around with glittering, high-rarity flex pulls.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Paradox Rift Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift wants to make a statement. Roaring Moon ex is the best pull here, both in power and price, and Groudon isn’t far behind with volcanic drama cranked to eleven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant and Altaria offer very different flavors of future aesthetic, and somehow they both work. Iron Hands ex might not be pretty, but it’s still a beast in competitive decks. If you're after a set that brings both gorgeous artwork and raw pressure, this is the one to crack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Temporal Forces Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Temporal Forces is part prehistoric brawl, part retro sci-fi. Raging Bolt ex leads the pack with one of the strongest attacks in Standard, and Iron Crown ex isn’t far behind, fueling Future decks with wild efficiency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking Wake ex wins big on artwork alone, thanks to Suicune’s eternal popularity, and Gouging Fire holds its own with surprise jungle-dino energy. Even Iron Leaves ex has sneaky-good utility. I want every single one of these cards for a different reason, which is exactly how a good set should work.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Obsidian Flames Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is the undisputed king here, with two of the most sought-after variants in the entire block. The Special Illustration Rare version is especially gorgeous, all fire and fury, while the gold Hyper Rare keeps things flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninetales and Cleffa bring artistic value, and I think Cleffa might be the most unexpectedly stunning card in the set. Pidgeot ex also deserves a shout for balancing playability with an ultra-stylized take on a Gen I classic. This is one of those sets where almost every big pull earns its spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign.1167009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaigns of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on multiplayer, stand by until after launch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was only a matter of time before someone got tired of waiting for EA to announce a new Command &amp; Conquer real-time strategy game without canceling it a few months later, and finally, Danish developer Slipgate Ironworks has become the one to take matters into its own hands. Tempest Rising plays like a C&amp;C game with the serial number filed off, and it does a fairly good job of scratching the itch for this style of fast-paced action with two very traditional but well-made campaigns set to the tune of a familiar soundtrack partly composed by distinctive C&amp;C composer Frank Klepacki. Given how closely it follows that template, though, it’s a little disappointing that it didn’t have more fun building personality and atmosphere between missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Single-Player Campaign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How closely, exactly? Aside from how it replicates the plate-spinning gameplay and basic tech tree (as many have done over the past 30 years), you could easily just change a few names – GDF to GDI and Tempest to Tiberium, for example – and Tempest Rising would be fairly indistinguishable from a C&amp;C iteration as you’re harvesting resources, building a base, and cranking out infantry, tanks, and aircraft that die in seconds if you’re not paying close attention when they encounter the enemy. Some of the similarities are amusingly on the nose: The Nod-like Dynasty faction’s barracks structure is shaped like giant hands reaching up from the ground, and they didn’t bother changing the name of the Mobile Construction Vehicle (MCV) that expands into your base’s central Construction Yard building at all. So yes, it’s pretty close!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaigns’ story is treated in much the same lovingly derivative way, reframing the GDI/Nod conflict as between the good guy Global Defense <s>Initiative</s> Force and the paramilitary Dynasty faction fighting for territory in Europe and northern Africa, though here it’s set in the aftermath of a Cuban Missile Crisis where things went much worse than they did for us. You wouldn’t really know that it’s a post-World War 3 world, though, because other than some wrecked roads on the battlefields, the regional maps in the briefings look pretty normal, and none of the missions take place anywhere recognizable. But more importantly, it’s missing a few of C&amp;C’s secret ingredients – chief among them a good villain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of the personality of the classic C&amp;C games came from the evil Nod faction and its mysteriously ageless leader, Kane (played with wild-eyed zeal by Joe Kucan). Granted, the Dynasty leaders who brief you before every mission have more character than the generic, gruff-voiced general of the GDF, but the constantly sneering Aleks can’t hold a candle to Kane. You can't build a cult of personality around a grumpy guy in a beret, and beyond being black leather fetishists, the Dynasty doesn’t have a lot going on ideologically – they’re not even explicitly framed as fascist bad guys out for global domination (especially when compared to the shadowy council pulling the GDF’s strings) so we don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower. Without something like that to get invested in – and coupled with some instances of comically poor voice acting – I was unmotivated to sit through the multiple strings of optional dialogue that give you more bland background on the lore but nothing else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a day and age when anyone with a smartphone can replace their Zoom background with a high-tech command center or dark and ominous paramilitary headquarters, I’m sad Slipgate wasn’t granted the resources to do C&amp;C-style live-action cutscenes and get someone to follow in Tim Curry’s legendary footsteps by chewing the virtual scenery to pieces. These generic animated characters just can’t compete, especially when there was clearly no budget to even match mouth movements to dialogue on most of them (conspicuously, both factions have lieutenants who give you orders through gas masks for no reason). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to actual real-time strategy, though, Tempest Rising fares much better. It may be playing within the constraints of a very defined genre and style, but it looks nice, runs well (it only crashed on me when loading a specific saved game), its interface is modern and friendly, and it’s pretty good at finding ways to be inventive with its faction design. Once you get past basic infantry, just about everything has a special ability or a twist to it that you’ll want to spend some time learning to use and decide if it’s worth your time to micromanage, as opposed to selecting everything and sending it into the attack-move meat grinder. There are too many to list, but the GDF’s heavy use of drone controller units is a fun one: you can control them independently to scout within a radius, you can pack their pilots into an APC or transport chopper and they'll still fly around and shoot, and if they’re destroyed they simply respawn for free in a few seconds. It's also a nice touch to generate resources for special abilities by taking the extra step of marking a target before destroying it – it's a good reward for a little bit of extra micro-management in small engagements. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Trebuchet answers the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't help but applaud when the GDF posed and then answered the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much; that's some excellent wish fulfillment for fans of both those series. These Trebuchet hybrids deploy and un-deploy so quickly – in about a second – that it really drives home how micromanagement-heavy Tempest Rising is built to be. You don’t need to constantly flip back and forth between mobile and stationary modes, but you’ll get more firepower and range out of them if you do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the opposing side, the Dynasty’s Scrap Truck is a wildly powerful unit that automatically repairs every vehicle or building in a radius while it’s stationary, and it can deploy to become a turret structure with an even bigger repair range. You can then use that to expand your base building area and stock it with flame and missile turrets (Dynasty can build a structure in advance and then instantly place it, while GDF places structures and then builds them), quickly creating a vehicle repair outpost with self-healing defenses right on the enemy’s doorstep. That, combined with their ultra-long-range Porcupine missile trucks and deadly SAM launchers, makes Dynasty a fantastic offensive turtling faction. And when you want to get a bit more aggressive, they can literally roll out a giant metal ball that flattens any tanks or infantry in its path if they can’t destroy it first.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Missions are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the variety of missions once you get past the first few tutorials is respectable but expected, including a lot of base-cracking, defense holdouts and last stands, and commando missions led by powerful specialist infantry, and all of them come with optional objectives for you to cross off that might encourage replays. It's interesting that some of those objectives don’t even pop up unless you scout out the whole map – it's a reason to go back and replay, but if you're trying to do everything in one go it might be a little trollish. All of these missions are well done but again, quite conventional; there’s nothing here that thinks radically outside the box or effectively builds minigame modes around unit abilities the way StarCraft 2 did. They are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like nearly every RTS campaign ever made, Tempest Rising gradually gives you access to new units and airstrike support abilities as you go, but here you also choose a new global upgrade every mission from one of three linear trees – plus you can unlock and then mix-and-match upgrades to fill an expanding number of slots. Some of the upgrades are minor but useful, such as adding burn damage over time to Dynasty’s flamethrowers or stat bonuses that start units out with a veterancy level. Some feel a little exploitative, like one that increases infantry vision range by 50% (which makes them incredibly effective spotters for artillery). A few, though, are meaningful choices that I’d definitely think hard about if I were to play through again on a higher difficulty. The biggest of these for me was the “Stolen Plans” abilities that let you build some of the opposing factions’ vehicles without having to capture their buildings. Some of those, like the Trebuchet tank and Porcupine missile launcher truck, are game-changers that helped me break through tough defensive lines quickly. It’s true that leaning on these can homogenize the campaigns a bit rather than emphasizing what makes each faction unique, but I appreciate being able to customize my force. Also, the ability to re-pack the Dynasty Scrap Truck after deploying it was a huge upgrade that saved me from having to build a whole fleet of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not spoiling anything that isn’t on the Steam page to say that late in both the campaigns, which follow the same events from opposite perspectives, the story abruptly introduces a third, technologically advanced faction tied to the glowing resource they’re all fighting over – which is a sentence I could’ve copied directly from the Wikipedia page of Command &amp; Conquer 3. The alien (ish?) Veti don’t have a playable campaign and aren't yet available in skirmish or multiplayer, so it's a bit tricky to understand how they work differently, but it’s good that they’re here for variety’s sake. Fighting their heavier armies isn’t dramatically different from taking on the GDF or Dynasty in the campaign – they have similar base and defense structures, tanks, aircraft, and infantry – but they do have a few terrifying late-game units that GDF and Dynasty can’t go toe-to-toe with and required me to take an entirely different posture when one showed up.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s two good-sized single-player campaigns are a large helping of comfort food for RTS fans old enough to remember Command &amp; Conquer in its heyday, and a way for everyone else to sample a classic style we don’t see very often anymore without having to deal with any creaky old technology. Its nature as an homage to those games does mean that it’s not terribly ambitious when it comes to doing anything bold you won’t have seen before, but it does put its own interesting spin on faction design that kept me experimenting with abilities throughout the campaigns and prevented it from feeling like too much of a retread. The main place it disappointed an old C&amp;C fan like myself was in its straight-faced mission briefings that can’t compare to the B-movie goofiness and memorable characters of the games that inspired it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn't support cloud saves, something that is available in the original Switch version.</p><p>Tears of the Kingdom official <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store page</a> says, "Please note: this software does not support the paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature." While reports state that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild also doesn't support cloud saves on Switch 2, its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store page</a> doesn't have the same disclaimer.</p><p>To add more confusion, this disclaimer apparently only appears on the US and EU store pages of Tears of the Kingdom. The <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096248" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese page</a> seemingly says that the save data storage feature requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-botw-totk-do-not-support-cloud-saves-saves-can-still-be-transferred-however.1166340/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">People have also discovered</a> that the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree also doesn't support cloud saves, while Switch 2 versions of Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond still do.</p><p>This is confusing because players can import their Zelda saves from the first Switch to Switch 2. But from that point forward, they can no longer create new cloud saves if they continue to play the Switch 2 version.</p><p>The Switch 2 versions of both Zelda games come with some new upgraded features, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-upgrades-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-revealed/1100-6530550/" data-ref-id="1100-6530550">Zelda Notes app</a>, which lets players locate undiscovered shrines and Korok Seeds, as well as earn in-game achievements.</p><p>Nintendo also stated that players will still be able to play their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-promises-switch-versions-will-still-work-after-upgrading-to-switch-2-editions/1100-6530633/" data-ref-id="1100-6530633">original Switch versions of games even after upgrading to the Switch 2 version</a>, although features and content in the latter can only be played on Switch 2. However, with some Switch 2 versions not supporting cloud saves, it's unclear how gameplay progress will be carried back to the original Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Codemasters announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> will join the extremely elite club of games supporting path tracing. Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.</p>
<p>On the subject, the developer said:</p>
<p><em>Expanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.</em></p>
<p>These aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.</p>
<p>The addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Authenticity and Customization Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2E_sML5CfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Codemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.</p>
<p>Codemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles.</p>

            <p>
Colours! They exist, right? They're all around us, everywhere you go, and as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> did something revolutionary: it made them customizable. Taking my sarcasm hat off for a moment, that means developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> added in the ability to choose different colour palette options for your costumes. It's just a small little way to add some amount of uniqueness to your version of the game's extremely pre-established characters, really. Except, the catch is that you have to pay actual money for them.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Well, ok, to be specific you have to buy them with <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1912740887026888751">600 of a new currency called Unstable Molecules</a>. But you can't just buy Unstable Molecules, you have to convert your Lattice into them, at a 1:1 exchange rate. How do you get Lattice? Finally, this is where you can spend your hard earned cash, by buying a 100-pack and 500-pack for about $6. Costumes themselves already go for around $20, which is one of the main ways the game makes money seeing as characters are always free, so I understand the thought process of charging for colour swaps.
</p>
<p>
Even still, you can't help but raise an eyebrow to extraordinary heights at a developer trying to ask people to spend real money on colours. Not to mention doing so a new currency obfuscates how much these things actually cost. Such is the curse of free-to-play live service games, I suppose, but a curse I find quite agitating.
</p>
<p>
Right now the colour options are only for a few characters like Magik and Luna Snow, and I imagine more will come in the future. I do wonder if NetEase will stick to their guns or just wait for people to stop complaining about it on Twitter (the site trying to be known as X).
</p>
<p>
In any case, Season 2 kicked off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-begins-now-with-emma-frost-new-team-ups-and-a-pc-performance-boosting-mode">just last week</a>, with NetEase promising that new heroes will be coming to the game every single month. Sounds like overkill and too much work for a team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">that isn't as big as it used to be</a>!

<p>Yoshida said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-boss-predicted-the-switch-2-would-be-usd100-cheaper-than-it-is-but-isnt-irked-by-usd80-for-games-like-mario-kart-world-as-publishers-shouldnt-be-limited-to-a-fixed-price/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>) that publishers should not be "limited to the fixed price on the shelf from the physical media days." Every game should be priced relative to what's being delivered he said, or in essence, "based on the value the publisher believes."</p><p>While Mario Kart World is $80, other first-party <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> are sticking with the $70 price point. Before this, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said Nintendo will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">"look at varying prices" for its games</a> "based off of just how robust the experience is."</p><p>Trinen added: "It's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?"</p><p>Nintendo has also caught some heat for the $70 price point for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch 2, in part over the fact that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-release-does-not-include-dlc-content/1100-6530815/" data-ref-id="1100-6530815">doesn't include the DLC</a>.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said he expected the Switch 2 to be priced at $400 USD, when in reality Nintendo went with $450 for the system itself and $500 for a bundle with Mario Kart World. Yoshida said the price hike might be due to "the cost of goods going up these days."</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, the Switch 2 is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">$50 more expensive</a> than the original Switch ($300) when it launched in 2017. Nintendo will reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-to-be-sold-at-a-loss-due-to-higher-production-costs-analyst-says/1100-6530766/" data-ref-id="1100-6530766">lose money on every Switch 2 it sells at the start</a>.</p><p>Explaining the price increase, Nintendo's Trinen said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">everything in life gets more expensive with time, and new Nintendo consoles are no different.</a> Others believe Nintendo is raising prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because it can, knowing people will pay it.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5 worldwide. US preorders were expected to begin on April 9, but Nintendo delayed them due to Trump's tariffs. More recently, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo could open US preorders for the Switch 2 in the coming days.</a> Some are wondering if Nintendo will re-open US preorders for the Switch 2 at a higher price point due to the tariffs, but it remains to be seen if that will happen.</p>

            <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-writers-new-dark-fantasy-vania-also-features-vampires-plus-screaming-spiders">first wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> in January, I worried I might have spotlighted a dud. Or at least, something fairly routine. Mandragora sure does resemble a lot of other dark fantasy side-scrollers: gritty yet plump, like they stuck a bike pump in Castlevania, or took a chisel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trine">Trine</a>. It sure does have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> classes and skilltrees. It sure does have crafting, with hundreds of items to acquire. </p>
<p>I confess, I covered it in large part because they have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> writer Brian Mitsoda on the ticket. But then I read the comments on that piece, weeks later, and there were a few lost souls raving about playing the demo for hours. Mandragora launches today. I've now spent an hour or two with a full build myself, and yeah, this feels like the good stuff.</p><!--more-->

<p>The key opening draw is that for all the emphasis in certain trailers on systems and craftables, Mandragora seems very story-led. It takes place in an apocalyptic world where a sepulchral King Priest holds sway over the Crimson City, promising to keep the nightspawn at bay. The King Priest looks a bit like Judge Claude Frollo from Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame, and shares Frollo's enthusiasm for torturing witches.</p>
<p>You play a Crimson City inquisitor who intervenes to mercy-kill one of said tortured witches, saturating yourself with a mysterious power in the process. Seeking to save face, the King Priest anoints you as one of god's chosen, and sends you forth to track down another witch. Meanwhile, a voice starts whispering in your head. </p>
<p>The opening tutorial sections are filled with sturdily voiced NPC chit-chats that thicken the setting like delicious fistfuls of cornstarch. The character portraits twitch and glare like possessed oil paintings - some of the commenters on my last piece found them off-putting, but for me, they're the best thing about Mandragora's visual direction so far. Hurrying through the Crimson City, you bandy words with some fellow inquisitors and pick up the rudiments of dodge-rolling. Then it's off to the woods to rescue a blacksmith and bother some massive wolves.</p>
<p>As an action-RPG, Mandragora appears to have plenty going on, striking a balance between the lean feel of classic Castlevania and the unlocks fusillade of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.  You've got a primary weapon and an auxiliary such as a spell or shield, a jump, a ledge-grab and a spread of gear slots. The combat goes heavy on stamina management and evasion, with the promise of stirring abilities and passives together into bespoke methods of monster-murderment.</p>
<p>The animations and controls are a bit halting, but it all seems engrossing enough. Still, I'm more interested in the gently labyrinthine levels, which are woven around Dark Soulsy altars where you can fast travel and level up, and are nicely abundant in secretive high platforms and concealed entrances.</p>
<p>Again, though, what grabs me upfront is the centrality of the story and writing. Even at its gamiest, Mandragora appears to be going for a certain consistency. There's a tutorial beat early on where you smash some crates and the merchant who owns those crates cusses you out, only to realise that you're an Inquisitor and beg for forgiveness. I like a game that knows how to turn an everyday Crash Bandicootism into characterisation. I'll hopefully have more thoughts down the road (Mandragora is an estimated 40+ hours in length). In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">here's the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the <em>Burnout Paradise</em> sequel I’ve been waiting for since 2008.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197525" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="197525,197298,197284" data-current="197525"><div><p>Erenshor Turns The MMO Experience Into A Surprisingly Fun Single-Player Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197525/197525_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23056.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502">the Switch 2 Direct</a></span> earlier this month first announced that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200?_gl=1*y9caif*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDQ4OTc2NjckbzQkZzEkdDE3NDQ4OTk1NDckajU3JGwwJGgw">the launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em> will let you drive between the race tracks</a></span> and hinted at an explorable world, I found an immediate greater interest beyond that of “MORE <em>MARIO KART</em>!” The idea of just aimlessly driving around a Nintendo-created world sounds completely brilliant.</p><p>Today’s Direct assured me that my suspicions were correct—that there was no way the developer would be able to resist packing the world with secrets, bonus items, missions to complete, and collectibles to find. And honestly, I find that even more enticing that shaving microseconds off of my best times on my favorite tracks. (OK, admittedly, I’ve not actually lost too many hours in that particular pursuit since an obsession with the N64's Koopa Troopa Beach level.) It reminds me of another gaming obsession: smashing every barrier and smashable billboard in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>.</p><p>Not playing driving games properly is a bit of a habit. And the best driving games are the ones that positively encourage it, like <em>BP</em>, and also the wonderful <em>Forza Horizon</em> games. Sure, there are races and cups and what-have-you, but what if I just drive over there? There might be a windmill! There might be yellow fencing I’ve yet to knock over.</p><p>I return to <em>Burnout Paradise</em> with a concerning frequency, almost never replaying all the races, my enthusiasm focused on smashing my way around Paradise City. It’s a passion strong enough to get past the game’s interminable opening screens and the contemptible babble of Worst Character In All Of Fiction, DJ Atomika. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, albeit without all the barriers to break, is giving me that same drive (sorry) to aimlessly explore.</p><p>The footage shows <em>so</em> much stuff to find out there! All those pads to jump off, blocks to bop, blue P switches to trigger, and then coins and who knows what else. It’s going to be just so much fun to veer away from the races and uncover the secrets. Or just pootle about, nudging at the edges, seeing if I can break the boundaries, and approach the kart racer like a third-person action game.</p><p>It’d be nice if it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">didn’t cost such an absurd amount of money</a></span>, although I’ve been fortunate enough to pre-order the bundled version (the magic of being a foreigner to your shores). I really hate that. I don’t care for any of the half-assed arguments about “worth” and “value”—I just hate that it means the game and all the joy it looks like it could offer will be cut off from so many more people.</p><p>Privileged as I am, I’m now far more hyped for this than I was before, my hopes of an open-world game beyond the racing seemingly validated. And then the racing on top of that, too! It’s fun to be <em>this</em> pumped for the ninth entry in an ongoing franchise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, among the many different scenes was a sneakily silly reference to an infamous moment in Mario history, and it all revolves around a little blue penguin.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Free Roam section of the presentation--at around the 12:04 mark--we see the Penguin racer approaching a cliff and driving off of it, plummeting to the water below. The kart lands safely in the waves, and the little guy cheerfully drives away. This is a far more fortunate fate than old-school Mario fans anticipated back in 1996, when the baby penguin debuted in the Cool, Cool Mountain stage of Super Mario 64.</p>

            <p>
Back when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> was getting properly big, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-princes-carlton-sues-fortnite-for-copying-his-legendary-dance">Carlton from the Fresh Prince famously tried to sue Epic Games</a> for the use of his dance in the game. (You could also buy the Carlton dance in Destiny, I remember, which I absolutely did, but I suppose Fortnite had just become the biggest game on the planet at the time.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Carlton - real name Alfonso Ribeiro - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-dance-litigation-crumbles-as-alfonso-ribeiro-refused-carlton-dance-copyright">was ultimately unsuccessful, as were a handful of other similar cases</a>. But whether because of the bad publicity or actual legal concerns, Fortnite pretty quickly cleaned up its act. Today it's home to countless dance emotes, music tracks and other bits and pieces, all agreed legally and above board.
</p>
<p>
But now, six years on from Carlton vs Fortnite, we have the maker of the Charli XCX Apple dance vs Roblox. The former has alleged that the latter sold their dance without permission, raking in roughly $123k (£93k) in sales. Has no one learned anything over the past half decade?
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, Apple dance creator and copyright holder Kelly Heyer began legal action this week. Heyer originally posted the dance on TikTok last summer, and it was correctly licensed by Fortnite and added to that game last December. 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, according to Heyer, added the emote last August after contacting her to gain permission, but before the permission was actually granted. 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement," Heyer's attorney Miki Anzai said. "Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."
</p>
<p>
Charli XCX herself, by the way, does not seem to be getting involved. The artist has used the dance on tour, but was not part of its creation. 
</p>
<p>
"As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole 'artist' for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer," the TikTok creator's lawsuit reads.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the lawsuit, a Roblox spokesperson said the game took "the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform". 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court."
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents who were "not comfortable" about their children's safety shouldn't let them play Roblox</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
