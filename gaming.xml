          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000162828025047811/ea-20250930.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new regulatory filing</a>, Electronic Arts outlined a number of the risks the company faces, and one of them is the company's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion sale</a> to a private investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose risks to its business activity in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly 10-Q filings</a>. EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues. Already, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">a group of EA employees wrote a letter to jointly speak out against the proposed sale</a>, expressing a range of issues and concerns about it, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures. The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.

<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">published its latest business report</a> (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-series-sales-october-2025/">Persona Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/persona-5-games-wont-stop-selling-series-tops-13-million-sales">Push Square</a>), and the Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million units since its debut in 2016. That's up from 10 million back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/the-persona-5-series-has-shifted-over-10-million-copies-worldwide">December 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Series, you ask? Well, that includes the original PS3/4 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5_dancing_in_starlight">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. <strong>Persona 5: The Phantom X</strong>, the mobile game, was not developed by Atlus and is not included.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nZnuGRwfwx0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnZnuGRwfwx0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8f0nohxki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://p-ch.jp/news/20511/">Atlus JP announced</a> that Persona 5 and Personal 5 Royal had sold over 10 million copies alone, making up the huge bulk of that 13k figure, unsurprisingly.</p>

<p>Talking about the growth in repeat sales (for all of Sega's series), Sega says that "In recent years, games have tended to enjoy longer sales lifecycles, and with the growing share of digital downloads, sales of repeat titles have increased accordingly."</p>
<p>In terms of other Persona games that are available on Switch (or Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> now sits at 2.07 million sales, though these figures are based on sales prior to the Switch 2 version's release.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>are</em> getting a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a>, though that doesn't appear to be Nintendo bound at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if we'll get to see it on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the final week of September, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">a report from The Wall Street Journal claimed</a> that Electronic Arts (EA) was going private in a massive $50 billion buyout, with the major investors being Silver Lake, a private equity company run by Jared Kushner, and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), among others. A few days later, the news would be confirmed, with EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">officially announcing it had agreed to be acquired by this 'Consortium' of investors for $55 billion</a>, and the video game industry has had endless questions ever since.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">Questions about the $20 billion of debt</a> that EA takes on with this deal, and what impact that will have on EA's future. Questions about whether EA will be able to continue making the kinds of games it makes now under its new ownership, and if the developers making those games will still be the ones who get to say what goes into those games and what doesn't. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">In an updated version of its FAQ</a> about the deal for EA employees (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners">Game File</a>), it seems like EA has tried to answer that question.</p>



<p>Under the question, "<em>Will our culture change as a result of this deal?</em>" a new line has been added which claims that "<em>EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact</em>."</p>



<p>Additionally, under the question "<em>What influence will these stockholders have on creative or business decisions?</em>" EA claims "<em>The Consortium believes in our vision, our leadership and our focus on creating games, stories, and content that reflect a range of experiences and delivering them to our global player community. They're investing in the creativity that defines EA</em>."</p>



<p>If this deal goes through, we'll see where these claims stand once we've seen EA release a game under its new ownership. Of course, there's the chance that these claims remain true, and that none of the new owners will try to influence creative control over EA titles. Or, we could see a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">similar situation to Fatal Fury adding Cristiano Ronaldo to the game</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, another element of the FAQ goes against a report from last week. Under the question, "<em>Will our approach to AI change under new ownership?</em>" an answer line reads, "<em>We will maintain a thoughtful, steady approach to AI. AI is a tool to empower our people to put creativity first by reimagining workflows and amplifying the creative power of our teams</em>."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> report, which quotes several current EA employees, does not describe EA's approach to AI as "<em>steady</em>" or "<em>thoughtful</em>," but rather that EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">is pushing AI on its employees in every task</a>, with tools meant to produce code in particular, causing a mountain of issues that then need to be fixed manually.</p>



<p>That said, workflows going from what they used to be, i.e. a programmer writing code, doing their best to make no mistakes, to having an AI tool write hundreds of lines of code without any care for the quality of it that then has to be fixed manually, does count as workflows being "<em>reimagined</em>" by AI if you think about it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> is the surprise recipient of a patch to add turn-based mode, developer Obsidian has announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from releasing Avowed, Grounded 2, and The Outer Worlds 2 this year, the Microsoft-owned studio has gone back to its isometric, party-based fantasy RPG over a decade after it came out with a fresh update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian announced a new public beta for Pillars of Eternity opens on November 5 for players on Steam and Xbox PC, which adds the turn-based mode. The reveal comes alongside a message from game director Josh Sawyer (last seen directing Pentiment), with his thoughts on what turn-based mode means for Pillars of Eternity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans who enjoyed experimenting with turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire will find familiar ground here, but with key improvements shaped by your feedback,” <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian said in a blog post</a>. More details are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How turn-based mode works in Pillars of Eternity:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Unbound Turns:</strong> All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions:</strong> Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing:</strong> Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility:</strong> You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As this is a public beta, please expect bugs and ongoing adjustments, Obsidian warned. The beta will run for “some time” as the developer continues to roll out updates and prepares for a full release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/eternity-turnbased-menu-1762196302444.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pillars of Eternity now has turn-based mode.

We said at the time: “Obsidian (and its Kickstarter backers) have done it: Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs since Baldur's Gate.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian followed PoE up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a> in 2018, before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/10/microsoft-to-acquire-obsidian-entertainment-inxile-entertainment">Microsoft bought the company later that year</a>. Obsidian went on to release the likes of The Outer Worlds and Grounded, and has become one of the most prolific Xbox Games Studios developers Microsoft has on its books.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will there be a Pillars of Eternity 3? Sawyer has commented on the prospect in the past. In 2023, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget">Sawyer said he would love to develop Pillars of Eternity 3 — under the condition the game receives the same budget as <u>Baldur's Gate 3</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if it truly was an unlimited budget, I think I would try Pillars 3 because I know what the budget was for Deadfire, which was not a whole lot and I have heard from multiple people what the budget was for Baldur’s Gate 3, and I’m not gonna talk about numbers, but if I got that budget, sure, I’ll make Pillars 3,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sawyer added that if he were to make Pillars 3, he would employ a turn-based combat structure. Obsidian has yet to announce its next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I just thought you'd want to know.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey. Hey you. Yes, you. The one playing Hollow Knight: Silksong. I just wanted to let you know, before you go any further, that you're missing a bench in Bilewater. Just in case that helps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not to Bilewater yet, this PSA is still for you. You will get there, and you will want to know this. I am going to spoil what's in Bilewater in this piece, so if you don't want to know that information, leave and come back when you've gotten sufficiently angry at Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bilewater is notorious. It is a massive, disgusting zone on the other side of the already frustrating Sinner's Road that you can stumble into fairly early on in Act 1 of Silksong, and which is required if you ever want to see the game's Act 3. There are many reasons why Bilewater is loathesome: it has many obnoxious enemy types that can ambush you and ruin your day, there are lots of spikes you can fall on and hurt yourself, and notably, it is full of maggot-infested water that will stop you from healing and regenerating silk. Bilewater is <em>awful.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But apart from the grub-water, one of the most standout horrors of Bilewater is its lack of benches. There's one bench way, way down at the bottom of Bilewater, in the Bell Beast station. At first, you might be tricked into thinking there is a second bench nearer the top lefthand side of the zone but, surprise! It's a trap. Not a bench at all. Down into the maggot water you fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So...uh...is that it? Is the Bell Beast bench really the only bench in Bilewater? Do you really have to do the entire zone, and the long, agonizing run back up to its boss over rivers of maggot-infested goop, past piles of spikes and exploding bug enemies and those awful things that belch poison at you, all with no break?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't. Be free. You're missing a bench in Bilewater. It is here:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="671" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nf4p7r/theres_a_secret_bench_in_bilewater_which_makes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silksong</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">detailed guide to getting through Bilewater</a> here on IGN, which you should use to find this bench when the time comes. The short version is that the hidden Bilewater bench is located behind a breakable wall on the far right-hand side of a cavern, past a giant pool of maggot soup at the bottom of a pit. Break the wall and drop down through another pit, then break another wall on your left to find the secret bench. This one, mercifully, is safe, and will not unceremoniously dump you into a pool of misery when you try to sit down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This bench is much, much closer to Bilewater's boss, Groal, though it's still a bit of a trek up to him. Again, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">our walkthrough</a> for help on surviving Bilewater, because it really is just a disgusting and difficult place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen a lot of people suggest that the run back to Groal, even with the help of the hidden bench, is one of the worst runbacks in the Souls genre. We're curious if you agree, so we set up the poll above. Vote to let us know which of these bosses has the worst runback from safety to their arena every time you die and have to attempt fighting them again. Or let us know in the comments if there's a worse fight we haven't mentioned here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to our Bilewater guide, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">detailed Wiki</a> to help you through every step of your journey in Pharloom, so check it out before, during, and after Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">FPS fans have spent months obsessing about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> map sizes, so some players finally took the time to measure and compare nearly every map the series has seen in the last 15 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield map size breakdown is a collaborative effort organized by Reddit users ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC and includes multiplayer locations featured in Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield: Hardline, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2042, and, of course, last month’s Battlefield 6. It comes not only with a side-by-side comparison for each game’s map, organized by game mode and player count, but also color-coded horizontal bar graphs, illustrating how EA’s approach to map sizes has changed through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed shared details about their analysis in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsbalz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a follow-up post</u></a>, clarifying that they have “done nothing but work on this the entire weekend.” The more than 45 hours of work resulted in a six-game, 72-map breakdown that paints a clear picture: Battlefield 6 doesn’t quite reach the gargantuan size of some of the series’ biggest maps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed points out that, while many of the relatively small Battlefield 6 maps, like Iberian Offensive or Siege of Cairo, are similar in size to maps seen in Battlefield 3 and 1, many of its larger maps rank among the medium-sized pool of maps studied. While games like Battlefield 3 and even Battlefield 2042 boast some of the most colossal maps the series has seen yet, Battlefield 6 falls short of offering even one map in the top 20. Even its largest map, Operation Firestorm, which itself is a downsized remake of the Battlefield 3 map of the same name, lands as the 32nd biggest map for total shared playable area and 22nd for total map area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are numbers the Battlefield community is already latching onto, but there are a few notes to consider. The evaluation stops short of including every map in the series, for example, with 2018’s Battlefield V, which ClaraTheRed says was difficult to gather data for, being one omission.

                <p>Rapper Soulja Boy is once again trying to sell a game console, this time selling what looks to be a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2 under the name SouljaGame Flip.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souljaboygame/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=aec8034c-b1b7-449b-ae69-bc2e82cd594a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (spotted by <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>), the artist known for his 2007 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" can be seen showing off what appears to be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2. He said the device is actually a new SouljaGame Flip console that is "out right now" and can be bought from his website. He said it has "all the games you need," a "fast processor," and "good graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulja Boy was originally selling "his" console for $436, over twice the $209 price the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 currently goes for on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid's official website</a>. But since news began to circulate about the rebranded device and its hefty price tag, the price seems to have been slashed to $200, actually making it cheaper than buying the device directly from Retroid.</p><p dir="ltr">The website where the SouljaGame Flip can be ordered shows images that look to be taken straight from Retroid's own website, only with some additional images showing white packaging that say SouljaGame. Even the names of the different console colors on the Soulja Boy website are the same as that of the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, including the GameCube-inspired GC color scheme. The console's store page description states the SouljaGame Flip is "the ultimate handheld gaming console endorsed by Soulja Boy."</p><p dir="ltr">Retro Dodo reached out to Retroid about the whole affair, and received an official statement that made clear Soulja Boy selling repackaged Retroid Pocket Flip 2s is not any kind of official partnership.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is not any kind of official licensing deal," Retroid said. "He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the US by ourselves."</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if Retroid will pursue legal action, but it's not the first time Soulja Boy has tried to sell game consoles. In 2018, the rapper sold Chinese emulators under his own label, and again in 2021 with a rebranded Game Boy-inspired handheld called the TRDR Pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">The handheld gaming market is currently booming, with a growing retro emulation device market and the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Xbox-branded ROG Ally</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="47cdbbd114c96"><a title="RE Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47cdbbd114c96/re-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly following its official announcement, the Resident Evil Pro Controller for Switch 2 has become available to pre-order.</p>
<p>So if you're really keen on picking this up, you might want to get moving before it's sold out. Something's telling us, however, that this might not happen, because good <em>lord</em> is it expensive.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available in the UK at an eye-watering <strong>£83.99</strong> via the My Nintendo store, which is even more expensive than the regular Pro Controller at <strong>£74.99</strong>. Over in the US, meanwhile, Best Buy is currently offering pre-orders at <strong>$99.99</strong> – the price for the bog-standard Pro Controller over in the states is <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's an expensive one. Aesthetically, it's not a patch on the classic <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Controller">Chainsaw Controller</a> from the GameCube days, either, but we can't have everything, can we?</p>
<p>Truth be told, we do like the overall design, but man, that Switch 2 logo in the centre is really doing its best to ruin everything, huh? It's literally obscuring the Resident Evil title, alongside a whole bunch of cool iconography from the overall design.</p>
<p>Still, it's neat that Nintendo is willing to allow a third-party Pro Controller at all, and the fact that it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, of all things, is really cool.</p>
<p>Both the game and the Pro Controller will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. A Grace Ashcroft amiibo will follow later in the year during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It will be years before we are close to even the release date for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, but that hasn't stopped people from asking CD Projekt RED and anyone connected to the series about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">We know the game is in pre-production</a>, and that it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">feature a kind of "<em>Chicago gone wrong</em>"</a> setting, and as of September, we know that Hollywood star <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/">Keanu Reeves would "<em>absolutely</em>" love to find a way back to the series to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand</a>. </p>



<p>Well, according to series creator Mike Pondsmith in a recent anniversary live stream that CD Projekt RED hosted, all Reeves needs to do is pick up the phone. Speaking on the stream, Pondsmith said, "<em>Not that long ago</em>, <em>I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I have ways to do that, Keanu</em>. <em>Contact me</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REDstreams special — Interview with Mike Pondsmith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_HsIlaqMkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pondsmith has already made it clear that he's not as involved with the sequel as he was with the first game, so while he might have an idea as to how Johnny Silverhand could come back from the dead and get Keanu Reeves back in the game, he might not necessarily have the authority to make it happen. CD Projekt RED could be on an entirely different path that doesn't involve Silverhand, so even if Reeves picks up the phone, it's not a sure bet.</p>



<p>Still, it would be exciting for fans to see him make a comeback in a way more meaningful than perhaps a flashback scene, which is currently the most feasible way we'd see Silverhand again.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-new-simpsons-season-is-an-incredible-treat-for-fans-of-the-show.1342534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Says It Will Keep “Creative Control” If Saudi Arabia Sale Goes Through]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-keep-%E2%80%9Ccreative-control%E2%80%9D-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through.1342531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is trying to ease concerns for employees about what could happen to their games if the planned sale to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) is finalized. </p>



<p>In a new SEC filing, first spotted by Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, EA has updated its employee FAQ to answer numerous questions surrounding the proposed sale. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific section</a> regarding the culture at the company, EA says that its mission and values will <strong>“remain unchanged.”</strong> It adds that the company will <strong>“maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</strong></p>



<p>The section continues, <strong>“We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork,”</strong> and that “<strong>The Consortium is supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and our strong culture.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-other-changes-at-ea">What About Other Changes At EA?</h2>



<p>It’s not just control over projects and games that employees have had questions about. With the group that includes the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners taking on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-bioware-producer-suggests-ea-sell-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$20 billion in debt</a> for this deal, some were concerned about future growth and even layoffs.</p>



<p>To both points, EA, as of now, says there shouldn’t be any worry.</p>



<p><strong>“There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction,”</strong> EA says. </p>



<p>Regarding growth, the company says that they will continue to pursue “<strong>organic and inorganic growth opportunities as a private company, even with new debt”</strong> and that there is an expectation to invest in the business in order to <strong>“accelerate innovation.”</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion deal to sell</a> EA and take it private is expected to close sometime after the start of Q1 fiscal year 2027 (after March 31, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think will happen when the sale of EA to the group led by the Saudi Arabia PIF is finalized next year?

                <p>One of the recurring themes from a vocal segment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> fans before and after launch was a desire to see the game free of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enjoy-your-crossover-free-battlefield-6-now-because-its-naive-to-think-itll-stay-that-way/1100-6534361/" data-ref-id="1100-6534361">Call of Duty-style ridiculous skins</a>.

But after releasing the recent "Wicked Grin" skin, Battlefield Studios has quietly removed the light blue outfit from the lineup.</p><p>Much like an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-are-roasting-an-orange-skin/1100-6535592/" data-ref-id="1100-6535592">apparent orange skin</a> and an earlier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">leaked skin</a>, the response to the "Wicked Grin" outfit was largely swift and negative.</p><p>"[What do you mean?] That is classic naval camouflage, because of all that water. Just find a fountain and you are golden," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt4gwc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote one Reddit user</a>. "LMAO this is not grounded and horrible looking," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt5egr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added another fan</a>. "Doesn't even look cool. What a mess."</p><p>After the response from players, Battlefield Studios re-released this outfit in more conventional military uniform colors and left the light blue shades behind. Battlefield 6 recently received a number of new cosmetics <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-battle-pass-season-1-all-skins-weapons-and-other-rewards/2900-7179/" data-ref-id="2900-7179">in the Season 1 battle pass</a>.</p><p>EA recently announced a new mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">Casual Breakthrough</a>, which will let Battlefield 6 players earn Career XP, Weapon XP and Battle Pass XP, while also accruing points towards challenges.

<p>"What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have," Watkins said. "It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction."</p><p>That's not to say "novelty" skins like Ronald McDonald or something like that will never appear in Arc Raiders. Instead, if Embark Studios were to consider these out-of-place costumes, Watkins said the team would likely create a skin that alludes to a person rather than being that person. Think more color scheme and less actual appearance. So, no <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">Nicki Minajs</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-adds-snoop-dogg-as-a-playable-character/1100-6502133/" data-ref-id="1100-6502133">Snoop Doggs</a> here.</p><p>"I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus," Watkins said. "That's not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that's kind of the line you can draw. We're pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don't know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly--I don't think the novelty is worth the trade."</p><p>It would be hilarious to see Santa Claus or a T-Rex-- or even Sabrina Carpenter--tearing robots apart with a pulse rifle, but that doesn't fit the game's design language. Maybe this could happen in the future, but for now, there are no such "novelty" skins coming.</p><p>"Novelty" and silly skins have been a hot-button topic in shooters lately, particularly among the likes of Battlefield and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">admitted that the series may have strayed from its grittier identity</a>, confirming that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> won't let you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">transfer your wacky costumes</a> from Black Ops 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bill Roper, a Blizzard veteran who worked on the first games in the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises in various capacities (producer, design, voice-over, etc.), has announced that his studio has secured funding for Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>The studio, Lunacy Games, was actually supposed to produce <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellgate-redemption-ue5-sequel-hellgate-london-details-sketchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellgate: Redemption</a>, a sequel to Hellgate: London, a cult classic Diablo-like game that Roper created after departing from Blizzard, and a game called Skinwalkers, which would merge the Weird West and Cthulhu settings, with players acting as cowboys. However, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/bill-robers-lunacy-games-raises-500k-from-accelerator-for-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Roper said the studio couldn't find anyone who would fund this project, which required between $15 million and $20 million. </p>



<p>They did find someone to fund Innsmouth Mysteries, though. <a href="https://www.bbx.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Accelerator</a> agreed to provide $500K for the project, which is a cooperative horror extraction roleplaying game inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In a mysterious 1920s seaside town, a team of player-controlled supernatural investigators must uncover the truth, collect arcane artifacts, and stop an ancient evil from being unleashed before midnight strikes.</p>



<p>Ying Sha, co-founder of BBX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Lunacy Games has a clear and compelling vision for a Co-op Horror Extraction RPG, and it's backed by a team of veterans whose track record speaks for itself. We are proud to support studios like theirs that are pushing the boundaries of games. We see Innsmouth Mysteries as a project that perfectly aligns with our mission to support talented teams to bring high-quality, deeply engaging experiences to players.</em></p>



<p>For his part, Roper believes there's a significant middle ground between triple-A and indie games that is currently underserved, a place where exciting gameplay mixes with deep, immersive, and story-rich experiences, which the studio aims to deliver with Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>Lunacy Games currently has just 13 employees, and Roper himself contributes to the audio work as well. There's no release window yet, but we'll keep track of the progress.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government urging action against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a> has been debated in parliament.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition</a>, which amassed just under 190,000 signatures prior to its closure in July, received a response from the UK government back in February, when it hit 10,000. "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games," this reply read. "Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue." As is the process, once it hit 100,000 signatures, it was eligible to be debated by parliament's petitions committee.</p>

<p>The debate lasted around an hour, and saw various MPs ask the government - represented by minister for sport, tourism, civil society and youth Stephanie Peacock - to respond to and provide extra clarity as to how its approaching the concerns set forth about game server shutdowns by the petition and some constituents. It also saw about a million game names be added to Hansard, the record of everything said in parliament, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> and a Super Mario World ROM hack trilogy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlMCTw5gTdk">Grand Poo World</a>.</p><p>In the end, Peacock stuck to the government's established line of making no amendments to the law, but working to ensure companies are providing consumers with the info they should when selling games. The government see the existing legislation designed to stop sellers misleading those buying goods by not providing accurate or complete info in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents">2015's consumer rights act</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2024/13/contents">2024's digital markets, competition and consumers act</a> as doing the job they need to, with Peacock saying: "The law works, but companies may need to communicate better". Meanwhile, in terms of the campaign's ask that publishers are mandated to provide a means for games to keep going after servers are switched off via a final patch or handing this over the community, Peacock said the following:</p>
<blockquote>The government is sympathetic to the concerns raised, but we do also recognise the challenges in delivering this from the video game industry perspective. First, this would have a negativen technical impact on video game development. It is true that there are some games where it would be relatively simple to patch an offline mode after its initial release, but for games whose systems have been specifically designed for an online experience this wouldn't be possible without major redevelopment. Requiring an end of life plan for all games would fundamentally change how games are developed and distributed. While that may well be the desired outcome for some campaigners, it isn't right to say the solutions would either be simple or inexpensive.</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the keys being handed to fan-run custom servers, Peacock pointed to a difficulty in determining who's then legally responsible for ensuring the game stays secure and complies with the law. Potential mixups which lead to people placing blame with the original developer or other harm to their reputation was another cited sticking point.</p>
<p>The government are considering taking one form of action based on the petition, that being having the <a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/">Chartered Trading Standards Institute</a> to put together specific guidance aimed at helping businesses ensure they're providing game buyers with the info the law requires.</p><p>The debate wasn't going to see the government suddenly do a 180 on their already stated response to the issue, but generally speaking I thought the MPs asking for clarification made some good points and had clearly done their homework. One thing in particular that caught my attention was Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon bringing up the recent deal for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">an investment group led by Saudi Arabia to take over EA</a> as the sort of corporate dealing that could see the waters muddied in terms of where the responsibility lies to ensure games do follow the rules in terms of server shutdowns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Labour MP Mark Sewards outlined his view that the government's current relatively laissez faire approach outside of making sure current laws are adhered to might not be ideal in the long run. "If we don't act now, the use of this model and the erosion of ownership rights may spread to other areas," he said. "I think that the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>
<p>This may be the end of the road for Stop Killing Games' UK petition, at least for now, but the wider campaign is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">in the process of preparing and waiting</a> for EU politicians to debate its citizens initiative on the issue.</p>

The currencies are linked to a description that states they are part of a housing market bundle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/22Nf00VN0WM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard has not yet released official details about how Hearthsteel will work or what it will be used for, it's likely it will be similar to that of Trader's Tender, another premium currency used for the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-trading-post-introduces-a-new-way-for-players-to-buy-items/1100-6511091/" data-ref-id="1100-6511091">Trading Post vendor</a>. Trader's Tender is primarily earned in-game by completing monthly challenges. The currency can't be bought on its own in the in-game shop but is included as part of other shop cosmetic bundles. It's also given out as a reward for preordering various editions of WoW's next expansion as well, with more expensive versions of the expansion granting more of the currency.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearthsteel might be used similarly in that it's something players may be able to earn by playing but also acquire by buying certain cosmetics on the store. Blizzard has already confirmed it will be selling housing related cosmetics via the shop, so Hearthsteel could potentially be included as part of those bundles for use at a specific housing-item vendor, similar to the Trading Post.</p><p dir="ltr">Until Blizzard officially outlines its plans, players will be left to speculate wildly about another form of microtransaction coming to the MMORPG, something one would think Blizzard would like to explain and justify sooner rather than later.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming Hearthsteel will be coming alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">housing early access as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch</a>, players might not have wait long to learn more. The patch is expected to arrive in December.

		<p>Milestone has released a gameplay mechanic video for its upcoming anime styled arcade racer Screamer, detailing the Sync and Entropy parts of the Echo system. Both Sync and Entropy have advantages for racers in Screamer dealing with offence and defence as battles play out across the tracks to gain advantages.</p>
<p><iframe title="Screamer - Gameplay Mechanics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVFRBbp1RMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sync is gained passively but it can be topped up by pulling off an active shift. Sync is used to generate shields to defend against incoming attacks, or boost to gain some extra speed. Sync in turn generates Entropy, and that is what you use to go on the offence. Entropy allows attacks like Strike and Overdrive. Strike is an attack that can make other racers explode, while Overdrive is a highly powered attack that boosts speed, grants temporary shielding, and lets you knock out opponents, but there’s a catch. If you crash into a wall while in Overdrive your car will explode, so picking the right time to use it will be vital. On top of these abilities, each character will have their own abilities to use too.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>That's a lot of Poké Dollars</p>

<figure data-uuid="80f5633033e3f"><a title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80f5633033e3f/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> celebrated its first anniversary last week, and it has seemingly been quite the money maker (thanks, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>According to new estimates from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>, which accounts for in-app spending from Google Play and the App Store, TCG Pocket pulled in almost <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in its first year alone, making it the highest-grossing debut for a Pokémon mobile app to date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>'s first-year player spending estimates tend to sit around the big 'one billy' mark, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a> are drops in the ocean, comparatively.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn't really come as a big surprise. TCG Pocket racked up over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-surpassed-10-million-downloads-in-its-first-48-hours">10 million downloads in its first 48 hours</a> on the market, and it was quickly reported that the app was pulling in around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-already-bringing-in-the-big-bucks">$3 million per day</a> as it got off the start line.</p>
<p>That appetite will have obviously slowed down a little in the months since, but it looks like the consistent cadence of new expansions and feature updates has kept the Poké Dollars rolling in. Hey, they do say that you've got catch 'em all...</p>
<p>To mark its one-year anniversary, The Pokémon Company released a special video, revealing that TCG Pocket players have opened over 18 billion packs, competed in 12+ billion battles, made 96 million trades and much more besides. You'll find it in full below:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em> has been a crowning success for Dread XP. It’s been a popular title, especially amongst the theory crowds, due to its intricate and obfuscated storyline, its analogue horror elements, and the general high quality of the games themselves. Well, our <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em>&nbsp;review will let you know if the series ends with a bang or a whimper.&nbsp;</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=XoYBnU1K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=1wnPi73J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They're like a kid in a candy store. Well, a kid and a sheep in a candy store.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a first-person horror puzzle game that sees you interacting with various “haunted” VHS tapes to solve puzzles and progress the story. It comes to us from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a>, famed publisher of indie horror, and dev team MANGLEDmaw, known primarily as the creator of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em></a> series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this, the third entry in the franchise, we’re rejoining the story where the last game ended. Having escaped from our local library through a mysterious underground hatch, we find ourselves inside the offices of Hamlyn Entertainment itself, the evil company behind much of the depraved goings-on in the series. It’s still a race to attempt to decipher exactly what has happened to create the possessed tapes, and if any good can be derived from these events.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bite-Sized Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=YOSkfV9n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=yVDkhJ9u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You get a genuine thrill each time that you complete a puzzle and unlock the next VHS tape.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As with the other two games, <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> can best be described as a bite-sized experience. In fact, these games have been close to episodic with how short they are and how quickly the turnaround is between games. Luckily, to aid in this final chapter successfully wrapping up the story, you’ve got the option of a recap baked right into the main menu of the game. It’s a nice touch, especially if it’s been a while since you last played.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back into the gameplay is a breeze, mostly because the mechanics are simple enough to be explained by a child’s drawing pinned to a corkboard. You can move and sprint about the place, duck, and interact with objects. That’s pretty much it, outside of an exciting moment when you can use another button to place little strings between pictures. Jokes aside, it’s a tried and tested formula, but it’s the execution that sets the series apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Something Wicked This Way Comes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=Q4hKW9Yr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=zO5nu1jP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It almost feels as if they're reaching right through the screen at you.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you start out the game, you’re already put in a high-pressure scenario. The prologue actually predates the first game in the series (as far as I can tell) and sets up what is to come for our main character. You’re exploring the belly of the beast, as it were, and the prologue does as good a job of letting you peek into the dark goings-on at the company, without completely blowing its load in the opening scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, you’ll also be left with some questions by the end. Things are wrapped up in a suitably satisfying way, but it’s not like you come across a journal or diary that just simply explains all of the minutiae of the world and what happened to all of the characters. There will still be enough room for YouTuber theorists to make videos about the hidden meanings, and frankly, I gather that’s half of the charm for a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Puzzling, and Puzzling</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=0owb4mlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=X15fnOhH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is a wholesome scene... right?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of raw puzzle performance, <em>Amanda The Adventurer 3</em> might be my favorite of the series so far. You get a little helper in this one who can spit out a clue if you’re feeling a bit stuck on stuff, which nicely greases the wheels on some of the puzzles if you’re having a slow day or just took a bludgeon to the head. Perhaps it’s that which made me feel less like I was bogged down. I distinctly remember in both of the other games having points where I was stuck for a long time, and in the end, I’m pretty sure it was dumb luck that saved me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this entry, the only pauses I took were due to my own lack of perspective, rather than something missing from the game. Getting too rigidly stuck in an idea can cause you to lose sight of all of your options, and that caught me out once or twice. In the end, I was left saying “ahh, I get it” more than I said “oh, that’s stupid,” and that’s the mark of a great puzzle game.</p>

<p>Maybe the puzzles were just generally easier, though; it’s hard to judge objective ‘difficulty’ in these cases, but I can at least report that I ended the game feeling like I’d had a good time without much piddling about.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Audio and Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=eF3bzu7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=ln9Bbtnu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a few more interesting tapes from a visual perspective this time, but they're all unique in how they affect the world around you and vice versa.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a relatively competent game from a visual perspective. Either as part of trying to make it run well on weaker hardware, or for purely aesthetic reasons, the graphics are kept simple and relatively low poly, and that does mean that the characters can look a little warped or janky at times. That said, I never really found it taking me out of the experience, and the times that moving figures are actually shown in the real world worked well enough for the experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sound design is universally pretty excellent. There’s not a lot of music on display here, as the atmosphere is paramount, but the creepy little details you can hear as you move around the offices are an insanely nice touch that does much more to improve immersion and “creep factor” than the visuals could ever do to ruin them. While it won’t be going away with any soundtrack or visual awards anytime soon, the devs should be proud of what they accomplished and the story it managed to tell.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-real-footage-of-a-man-stood-behind-a-podium.jpg?itok=_TRGiFfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-real-footage-of-a-man-stood-behind-a-podium.jpg?itok=7WVj0RFy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As long as you examine the game deep enough, you'll find the answers that you seek.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a great entry to cap off one of indie horror’s most endearing recent series. While the gameplay style might seemingly lack innovation, there’s always something unique to the way that you’re interacting with the mechanics, and the mysterious storyline and engrossing atmosphere turn the entire thing into a superlative horror experience. Now I’m just waiting for the “definitive edition” where you can play through all three parts in one go.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Last month, Heart Machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-development-is-ending-in-early-access-and-devs-heart-machine-are-laying-off-staff">announced that they would be ending development</a> on their roguelike follow-up to the seminal indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. As a result, as is far too common in the industry these days, a number of staff were laid off - including a writer on the yet-to-be released Possessor(s). As a result, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2132890/discussions/0/786567268147400897/#c786567268147744312">post cropped up</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)'s</a> discussions page on Steam with some expressing discomfort at the idea of buying the game post-layoffs, prompting the game's narrative director to explain why he (understandably) would still like it if you bought it.
</p>
<p>
Harris Foster, representing the game's publisher Devolver Digital, explained in the comments that Heart Machine had confirmed that "all revenue-share eligible team members who contributed to Possessor(s) will continue to receive their share," including those no longer at the studio.
</p>
<p>
In turn, another comment from a user named Anthem of Grimm questioned whether people should buy the game or not "so that the developers that were fired can receive pennies on the dollar?" This is where narrative director Tyler Hutchison came in with a very honest response: "As a developer who is slated for lay off - PLEASE BUY THIS GAME!"
</p>
<p>
Hutchison broke down a few of the reasons why you should still consider buying the game, from the practical to the personal. For one, he noted how if the game ends up doing well, it could make those that have been laid off be able to find work easier; "'Oh you worked on Possessors? That game made a bajillion dollars. Please have a stable job with my company. Or Please have a bunch of money to make a new video game.'"
</p><p>
He also pointed out that everyone on the team made Possessor(s) "make games because we want people to play them and have fun. IF no one does that... I really just wasted 3 damn years of my life." And Hutchison also pointed out the profit sharing point, explaining that he knows he will receive a share, though didn't want to speak for everyone.
</p>
<p>
These are all generally quite fair reasons, and humanises the whole process in a way that is often quite corporate. How are we meant to respond when a company has layoffs? When it's a massive studio, it's unlikely enough people will stop buying their games to truly make a dent, but for a developer like Heart Machine, could it make the difference? I don't have the hard data to comment otherwise, still, it gives me pause.
</p>
<p>
There isn't a correct answer to any of this, it's ultimately up to you and your own moral compass in this situation. For what it's worth, Hutchison's explanation did convince Anthem of Grimm to pick Possessor(s) up, so if anything this is a good example of why we need more open conversations about these topics.
</p>
<p>
Possessor(s) is due out next week on November 11th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new public beta for Obsidian Entertainment’s Pillars of Eternity has been announced to test a mode fans have been asking for. Furthermore, it’s open to everyone starting on November 5th.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been in rare form in 2025. From Grounded to The Outer Worlds 2, the RPG-centric company has had quite the year. Fortunately, it hasn’t forgotten about its past, especially its Pillars of Eternity series. Inspired by Baldur’s Gate, the top-down RPG has gone on to have a sequel, Deadfire, and be the setting for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> in Eora. One feature that fans of Deadfire got to try was turn-based combat, evolving the game’s stop-and-play style. After a tease this year, the team has announced that it’s coming to the original in beta form.</p>



<h2 id="h-pillars-of-eternity-adding-turn-based-mode-with-public-beta-starts-november-5th">Pillars of Eternity Adding Turn-Based Mode With Public Beta, Starts November 5th</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pillars of Eternity – Turn-Based Mode Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post from Obsidian</a>, it announced that Turn-Based Mode is coming to the original Pillars of Eternity. The mode, available via a public beta, is releasing on November 5th, 2025. You can see the gameplay in action <a href="https://youtu.be/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>, but it seems the team wants to fix some of the snags it encountered during its incorporation into Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Combat feels a lot faster and accurate, which fans should enjoy. Luckily, if you want to test it out or change it, you can freely switch between regular and turn-based whenever. </p>



<p>For fans of Pillars of Eternity, this seems like the perfect time to return to the series. A third entry is unknown, as the previous two titles needed crowdfunding to come together. However, after Deadfire, Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, followed by The Outer Worlds and Pentiment. Perhaps this addition could lead to a franchise return? We shall see but, for now, this should do for fans and newcomers alike.</p>



<p>What do you think of Turn-Based Mode coming to Pillars of Eternity? Did you play the mode in Deadfire? Will you join the beta on November 5th? Would you like to see the series return?

<p>NetEase is closing one of its studios, just two years after it was first opened. </p>



<p>As per studio head Greg Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down as of November 17. It’s likely that the entirety of the staff at the studio will be made redundant.</p>



<p>“While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains,” Street said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. “While we’d love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that’s at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle was formed in 2023 by NetEase, and had been working on a triple-A fantasy MMO codenamed “Ghost”. Prior to heading Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street was a lead systems designer on World of Warcraft.</p>



<div><p>“To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me,” he continued. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one. To our supporters at NetEase, thanks for taking a chance on us.</p><p>“For our team, I appreciate you coming with me on this journey, and let us hope we can continue to work together.”</p></div>



<p>The studio’s confirmed closure comes just weeks after Street first announced that NetEase was pulling funding from the studio. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_i-wanted-to-share-the-news-that-fantastic-activity-7382143103379587072-LfgX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">At the time</a>, he said that NetEase had been “gracious and supportive” while they looked for a new publisher. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for a statement on what happened during efforts to find a new partner. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

                <p>Remember the good old days when Flash games were at their peak, and it seemed like we had an unlimited free gaming library to choose from, no matter the type of PC you had? While that gilded era is now behind us, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FXHVX3VS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a> will soon let us revisit some of the most memorable Neopets browser games when it launches for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC on March 26, 2026. The game will feature 25 classic Neopets flash games, plus an all-new minigame exclusive to this collection made by the original Neopets team, and a secret unlockable bonus minigame, for a total of 27 minigames. Each classic minigame has been enhanced for modern platforms with higher-resolution graphics and new features like local co-op modes. Preorders are available now for just $30, and securing an early copy gets you some cool physical extras and bonus DLC.</p><h2>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p>The physical PS5 or Nintendo Switch versions of Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection come with an exclusive set of extra items, including a double-sided poster, two sticker sheets, three art cards, and DLC for the Neopets website. While not strictly preorder bonuses, preordering your copy is a wise decision if you want these extras, as they may sell out soon after launch. Note that these bonus items are only included in the physical edition of the game. There are no preorder bonuses included in the digital edition.</p><div title="6535854 - Neopets Mega Mini Games Collection" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4860" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535854 - Neopets Mega Mini Games Collection" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$30 | Releases March 26, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection includes the base game on your platform of choice, plus the extra items listed above if you grab the physical edition.

Local co-op play is enabled for select games in the collection, including Snowball Fight, Jumpin’ Gem Heist, Jubble Bubble, and more, which means you can bring a friend along for part of your journey.
