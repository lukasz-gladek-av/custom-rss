            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new certification license has been found that could make the PSVR 2 headset compatible with PC sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>First found by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@SadlyItsBradley</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certification license</a>, which happened on March 27, 2024, suggests that Sony could be thinking about changing its PSVR 2 strategy.</p>



<p>The new adapter could mean that players who own the headset or intend to buy one soon have access to a huge library of games on the PC. In early 2024, PlayStation announced that it is planning to add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-planning-pc-support-for-psvr2-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC support for the PSVR2</a> system sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>The announcement read, “Also, we’re pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5.”</p>



<p>In March 2023 and despite rumours suggesting that the headset was selling poorly, PlayStation announced that the headset sold around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-is-outselling-the-psvr-sony-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">600,000 units in its first six weeks</a>. However, the headset has since seen a lack of post-launch support with new games since its release, with recent rumors suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company has paused production of the headset</a> due to poor sales.</p>



<p>One could speculate that the move to PC facilitates the lack of games on the company’s hardware and if the rumors of production being paused are true, perhaps we could see a relaunch alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a>, which is scheduled to release later this year. </p>



<p>What do you think of the PSVR 2 coming to PC? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

According to a <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053">certification</a> discovered by <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709/photo/1">VR enthusiast Brad Lynch</a>, Sony has developed a PSVR 2 “adapter” that provides PC support for the otherwise PS5-exclusive device.</p><p>Sony said that it was working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079928/sony-psvr2-pc-support-2024">PC support for PSVR 2 in February</a>, targeting a non-specific 2024 release date, but the company hadn’t previously mentioned what form this support would take. With the adapter certification being filed back on March 27th with South Korea’s regulator, it seems Sony is on track to easily meet its self-imposed PC support deadline.&nbsp;</p><p>No other information about this mysterious adapter — including its price, appearance, or specified release date — is currently available. We’ve reached out to Sony to clarify and will update this story if we hear back.</p><p>Still, its existence should be a welcome bit of news for the modding community that’s been attempting to get the PSVR 2 working on PC gaming rigs since the headset was launched in 2023. The $549.99 PSVR 2 went on sale for more than the PS5’s $499.99 launch price, making it a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23439183/vr-virtual-reality-psvr2-playstation-meta-quest-pro-apple#:~:text=PSVR2%E2%80%99s%20%24549.99%20price%20is%20already%20high%2C%20but%20tack%20that%20on%20with%20the%20starting%20PS5%20price%20of%20%24399.99%20and%20it%20means%20the%20minimum%20cost%20to%20use%20PSVR2%20is%20%24950">controversial purchase</a> that should be usable beyond Sony’s console.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling PC support should eliminate one of the biggest deterrents keeping people away from the device.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24.883593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="121" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Paletools is a handy tool to use for those who have invested a lot of time and energy in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team mode.</p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The Ultimate Team offers a web app and a companion app (exclusively available on mobile devices). EA Sports has hardly innovated these tools despite critical feedback from many users. This is where a tool like Paletools comes in, but there’s always a risk of using third-party applications. However, much of the fear around using this tool is more of a myth than a certified fact.</p>  <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">The web app is mainly used to solve different SBCs, open packs quickly, and buy/sell cards on the Ultimate Team market. Unfortunately, there are still plenty of limitations that affect its utility. For example, the method of completing SBCs in EA’s app isn’t really optimum.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">To remove these limitations, you can use the Paletools extension to automate a lot of these processes. While the official app can’t disregard the positions of a card while <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-90-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks-solutions/">completing SBCs</a>, the third-party extension can allow you to bypass that limitation. There are plenty of other great features like automated pack openings, removing animations from opening packs, and more.</p> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
  <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">It’s a fact that no third-party extension is 100% safe, but the safety depends on how you’re using the tool. Two activities can get you a ban:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false"> <li>Using the market bot (can get a permanent ban and lose all Ultimate Team progress)</li> <li>Solving too many SBCs too quickly (can get temporary ban without losing any Ultimate Team progress)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">Do note that you can also get an SBC ban from using the official app. The best way to prevent that is to give a cap after solving a certain number of SBCs. I never use the market bot, and there hasn’t been any problem in the last three months. I also take regular breaks from solving SBCs and haven’t yet faced a temporary ban of any duration from completing them.</p>
  <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="144" data-injectable="false">Using this highly useful extension is extremely easy. First, you’ll have to set it up, and I prefer using it on the Google Chrome browser.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false"> <li>Go to the official website.</li> <li>From the home screen, drag the URL link to a blank bookmark bar.</li> <li>Save the bookmark and refresh the web app.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="false">Do remember that a third-party app/tool will always have some danger, so take the risk of your free will. When used properly, a lot of your time and efforts will be saved, especially at times when so many <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">TOTS SBCs</a> are available in <em>EA FC 24</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-renato-sanches-flashback-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s been a long hard road, but since I vowed to only consume alcohol matured while having game soundtracks forcibly blasted into its molecules, giving up drinking has been a lot easier. Now, to take the final gulp of my Snake Eater-theme-reared IPA, and open up my web browser….</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Oh. Welp. Party’s back on I suppose, because Japanese retailer Onkyo Direct <a href="https://onkyodirect.jp/shop/pages/WOTW.aspx">are selling</a> two varieties of official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier: Automata</a> wine, matured in barrels with speakers attached to them that exclusively pump out the character <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action games</a>’ soundtrack. The two red wines - named 9S and 2B for Automata’s android heroes -  were each force-fed different playlists selected from the game’s soundtrack. The wine’s retail at around $80 US a bottle, and each comes with an exclusive glass featuring a Lunar Tear design (that’s a thing from the video game, Nier: Automata.) I really don’t have too much else to add to this, aside from bringing its existence to your attention. However, upon learning of it, I am confident that you, too, will think: Yes, that is definitely a thing someone has done then put up for sale.</p>
<p>When I showed this to Edders, he immediately compared it to those <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/research-matters/news/post_3133767-moo-nlight-sonata-up-study-finds-that-cows-soothed-by-classical-music-produce-more-milk">cows they play classical music at to yield more milk</a>, although I’m left both unsure and intrigued to exactly what effect the Automata music would have on wine. Naysayers among you will have already dismissed the whole thing as a marketing stunt, but I do believe the Nier soundtrack has some deep magic to it. For example, it’s very effective at making you treat incredibly hokey and surface-level allusions to undergrad philosophy as if they’re mind-shattering layers of subtext. I mock because I love - Automata is a beautiful piece of work and Yoko Taro is the only person allowed to call a big robot ‘Engels’ like it means something in my presence.</p>
<p>For those still clamouring for further adventures in the Taro-verse, Nier producer Yosuke Saito <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-will-continue-as-long-as-yoko-taro-lives-producer-says-but-dont-expect-an-automata-follow-up-soon">recently teased</a> that the team may be working on more Nier. “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now,” said Saito. “I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Cheers for the wine spot, <a href="https://x.com/SpBrando/status/1795488188443881916">BrandoSP</a>.</p>

			<p>An official PlayStation VR2 PC adapter made by Sony Interactive Entertainment is being certified, <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to YouTuber Brad Lynch</a>, who found <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a listing</a> on the South Korean National Radio Research Agency (RRA).</p>
<p>Ever since the PlayStation VR2 headset was unveiled with its high-end capabilities, PC users have been eager to find a way to make it work on their favorite platform. In June 2023, the developer behind the driver that allowed the original PS VR headset to be used on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-pc-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the PS VR2's design meant additional hardware would be required to make it work. However, not long afterward, the same developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-on-pc-is-closer-now-that-6dof-tracking-has-been-fully-ported/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solved the hardware authentication problem</a> and fully ported 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) tracking.</p>
<p>Still, it was far from official support of PlayStation VR2 on PC. Sony would have had to change its stance for that to happen, which it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-official-pc-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this February</a>. In late March, the headset's latest firmware also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-firmware-pc-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enabled PC access</a>, hinting at a direct connection. We've now received confirmation that this will occur through the official PC adapter mentioned above.</p>
<p>PlayStation VR 2 launched for Sony's PlayStation 5 console in February 2023. At the time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto earned it an 8.5 out of 10 score:</p>
<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power. As new experiences are brought to PlayStation VR2, the value can only improve, but the initial cost of admission may leave some players wanting to take the headset for a test drive first before investing in something the price of a second PlayStation 5.</em></p>
<p>Despite glowing reviews, PS VR2 sales have been underwhelming, to say the least. Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-production-reportedly-paused-until-sony-sells-current-backlog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to pause production</a> while it waited for the current backlog to be sold. They're clearly hoping that opening up PC support will increase sales, though it might be too late for that. Let us know how you feel about it in the comments.</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Cheating has been an issue in <em>Call of Duty</em> for a long time, especially affecting their free-to-play battle royale <em>Warzone</em>. Activision has landed a major blow in the war against hackers though, winning $14 million in damages from EngineOwning. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Activision filed a suit against the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/activision-files-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-site-engineowning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheat providers in 2022</a> and on May 28, Central District of California Judge Michael Fitzgerald ordered EngineOwning to pay $14,465,200 to Activision in damages. The judge ruled that the company must pay $200 for every cheat that was downloaded, along with $290,000 in legal fines, and the handover of the EngineOwning domain, as shared by CharlieIntel. </p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: Activision has been granted default judgement in its court case against cheat provider EngineOwning. </p><p>Judge ruled EngineOwning owes Activision $14.45M in damages and $292,900 in legal fees. </p><p>Judge ruled EngineOwning website domain must be transferred to Activision. <a href="https://t.co/oWTbYygiZe">pic.twitter.com/oWTbYygiZe</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795639002416271574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The minutes of the judgment reveal that in the United States, cheats were downloaded from EngineOwning 72,328 times, which is a huge number. It’s worth remembering that this only includes the U.S. too, and not worldwide sales of the cheats that the company provided. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">EngineOwning was best known for <em>Call of Duty</em> cheats, selling hacks that allowed players to use aimbots, see enemies through walls, and make changes to in-game lobbies. Cheating became an epidemic in <em>Warzone</em>, with players begging Activision to do something about it, eventually leading to the creation of the RICOCHET anti-cheat system. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="false">The system, along with Activision’s pursuit of cheat providers, has helped to bring the number of hackers in <em>Warzone</em> down, although the unfortunate reality is that it’s almost impossible to wipe them out completely. Seeing the huge payout that EngineOwning has been ordered to pay in court, however, may be a big deterrent to other providers who think selling cheats is worth their time. </p>

<p><iframe title="Samurai Warriors 4 DX - Steam Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psEN_sukaCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s unclear why the Japanese publisher chose now to do this, possibly fuelled by the recent surge in popularity surrounding samurai media, and a need to plug a hole in its release calendar. After all, it’s been a while since we last had an update on what’s happening with Koei’s long-running Warriors series. It didn’t seem all that long ago that hack n’ slash fans could reliably look forward to a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> game every few years, with Samurai Warriors instalments comfortably sandwiched in between.</p>


<p>Regardless of its motives, Samurai Warriors 4 DX allows Koei Tecmo to showcase one of the series’ most popular offerings to a new audience of PC gamers. If this is somehow your first dalliance with these games, they follow a similar template that honestly hasn’t changed too much since Dynasty Warriors 2 (known in Japan as Shin Sangoku Musou) first tore up the genre on PS2 back in 2000. Taking on the role of famed warriors from Japan’s Warring States period, you’ll blitz through entire battlefields, annihilating enemies by the screenful as you bash out button combinations in an almost zen-like state.</p>


<p>Samurai Warriors 4 is fondly remembered for a number of reasons. Firstly, the game offered a playable roster of 55 characters each with their own unique movesets, and customisable weapons. It also offered a wider selection of story-driven missions, allowing you to watch events unfold from the perspective of certain clans and characters, including Nobunaga Oda and posterboy Yukimura Sanada.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, original developer Omega Force also made some welcome improvements starting with Hyper Attacks. These enabled players to seamlessly weave from one group of enemies into the next without breaking their combo chain, complemented by other mechanics such as the Spirit Gauge. Being able to switch between characters on the fly would also help manage the battlefield, with an option to assign command to your inactive partner. The game also felt more fleshed out than previous entries, bundling in the addictive Chronicles mode where you could create your own character and skirmish your way across Sengoku era Japan.</p>

<p>Samurai Warriors 4 DX presents itself as the definitive way to experience all of this, bolstered by an extensive catalogue of over 150 DLC packs. Granted, most of these are purely cosmetic and superfluous, though DX has another trump card: allowing for handheld play via the Steam Deck. The laid back, low-commitment style of gameplay these titles ascribe to goes hand-in-hand with portable gaming, unless you’re dialling up the difficulty to its most extreme.</p>
<p>If you’re at all curious about the Warriors franchise, this is perhaps the best gateway. However, with this re-release brandishing a £39.99 launch price, you might rather hunt down a cheaper copy of the newer Samurai Warriors 5, or wait for a cheeky discount.</p>

            <p>
Three-and-a-half years after its disastrous December 2020 debut, after dozens of patches and the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty expansion, CD Projekt Red no longer has anyone working on Cyberpunk 2077.
</p>
<p>
Just 17 people had been working on the game still as of 29th February this year, CD Projekt previously shared as part of their last financial update. Now, as of 30th April, that number is zero. 
</p>
<p>
It's a small but significant moment for CD Projekt as it finally leaves Cyberpunk 2077 behind - with the vast bulk of its development might now focused on its next game in The Witcher series, currently still codenamed Polaris.

<p>
But CD Projekt has several other projects in the works as well, of course, including a growing contingent (as of last month, 56 people) focused on a full-blown sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently codenamed Orion.
</p>
<p>
39 people, meanwhile, are working on The Witcher multiplayer spin-off codenamed Sirius, which is being primarily put together by internal studio The Molasses Flood.

</p></div>
<p>
Lastly, and most mysteriously, CD Projekt retains a team of 20 people working on its all-new franchise, codenamed Project Hadar. 
</p>
<p>
With no-one still assigned to Cyberpunk 2077, its now unclear whether the game will get any further tweaks or patches. But Cyberpunk 2077 is now in a strong state - and last month CD Projekt thanked fans as its game finally hit the milestone of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-director-thanks-fans-as-the-game-hits-a-95-positive-review-rating-on-steam">having a 95 percent positive rating on Steam</a>. It's also now one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">our favourite RPGs to play right now</a>.

			<p>CD Projekt RED reported the company's Q1 2024 financial results yesterday. The Polish company registered $57.89 million in consolidated revenues for the first quarter, while consolidated net profit came in at $25.50 million, a 44% improvement year-over-year. Most of those sales were driven by Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already sold over 5 million units in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also proudly boasted that, on May 10, recent user reviews on Steam for the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 95% positive score, labeled 'Overwhelmingly Positive.' However, at the time of writing, this appears to have gone down to 90% - which is still great, of course.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IQvSCRU_Pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensuing earnings call</a>, CD Projekt RED Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski confirmed the studio's goal to increase the cadence of game releases.</p>
<p><em>We already worked on two projects at the same time when we worked on Phantom Liberty because that was a game-sized project with almost 300 people working on it, and at the same time, we have already been working on Polaris, so we've had an experience of working on more than one project. And we are working on more than one project at this time as well. There is Cyberpunk 2 being developed in Boston, there is Polaris being developed predominantly here in Europe, and obviously, we have other projects with other teams like Project Sirius, also in Boston with The Molasses Flood.</em></p>
<p><em>And there is The Witcher 1 remake done in cooperation with Fool's Theory, so you can definitely expect us to release more titles and the cadence of launches is something we definitely plan to increase, although I will obviously not comment on what is the space between the projects time wise.</em></p>
<p>As always, CD Projekt RED also provided an update on how many developers are working on each project. 407 staff members are working on Polaris (The Witcher 4), 56 on Orion (Cyberpunk 2), 39 on Sirius (the spin-off), 20 on Hadar (the new intellectual property), 96 on 'shared services' (localization, quality assurance, data, insights and experiences, artificial intelligence), and 13 on other projects.</p>

		<p>Bungie have released the launch trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape/">The Final Shape</a>, the last (?) large expansion for Destiny 2 which launches on June 4th 2024. The previous expansion, Lightfall, was not particularly good but it does look like Bungie are going to knock it out of the park for the end game, for the first time in a very long time I am actually excited to play!</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer teases a lot, most notably the ‘cubing’ of not just The Last City, but the entire of Earth and everyone on it. What this means for areas such as the Cosmodrome and the EDZ, and indeed characters who live there such as Shaxx and Ada, is unclear.</p>
<p>Further on we see Zavala being tempted by The Witness, Cade looking at his own dead body, and Crow finally going super and using Golden Gun. There’s also the Avengers Endgame moment with all the allies pouring through the triangular portal.</p>
<p>The Final Shape will not only bring the story to conclusion, there are massive changes coming to the game not least of which is a new Prismatic class.</p>

<p>“For the first time, players will be able to wield the powers of Light and Darkness simultaneously, unlocking combinations of abilities never before possible,”<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/prismatic_deep_dive"> say Bungie</a>.&nbsp; “The Prismatic subclass is familiar, but with a twist. Your Super, melee, grenade, and Aspect slots will feature a selection of Light and Darkness abilities from all five damage types. You can also select from all available movement modes and class abilities, including the subclass-specific ones, such as Phoenix Dive, Acrobat’s Dodge, and Thruster. ”</p>
<p>“Our main goal for Prismatic is to enable new and interesting buildcrafting combinations that lead to new types of gameplay, so that we can keep the game feeling fresh. As part of this, some of the abilities we’ve chosen are ones that we think have been underused since their initial release and have exciting interactions with the rest of the roster. In many cases, we’ve adjusted how certain Aspects function to specifically enable these unique interactions.”</p>
<p>Destiny 2 will be going offline for a whopping 25 hours before the Final Shape launches which is on&nbsp;June 4, 2024 and will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>The rumored announcement of the God of War Ragnarok PC port is imminent, according to a reputable leaker.</p>
<p>On X, known deals leaker 'Billbil-kun' <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1795562998196560063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Sony and Santa Monica Studio will be announcing the PC version of the God of War sequel "very soon". Unfortunately, the leaker can't specify an exact date just yet. Earlier this month, the leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that 2022's God of Ragnarok would be the next former PlayStation exclusive to be ported to PC. In addition, it was claimed that the announcement could very well be made this month.</p>
<p>Take this information with a pinch of salt for now, but 'Billbil-kun' has been spot on when it comes to leaking upcoming new PS Plus and Game Pass titles. In addition, the leaker has proven to be reliable when it comes to leaking unannounced titles as well - last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-is-the-series-next-installment-coming-to-pc-ps5-xsx-and-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leaker correctly leaked Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok was released for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 back in November of 2022. Last year, the game received the excellent free Valhalla expansion. Here's what we wrote about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion in our review last year</a>:</p>
<p><em>For a free expansion, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla offers quite a lot. The roguelite take on the base game's formula works extremely well, thanks to the excellent combat system, which truly shines in the extreme combat scenarios Kratos will have to conquer to confront his past and finally make a step towards the future. Its short length, which prevents the adventure from overstaying its welcome, and excellent accessibility with multiple difficulty settings that don't lock content behind them, also make the expansion one that all those who loved the base game should play.</em></p>

<p>Following cost-cutting measures by Take-Two Interactive, the CEO of the firm, Strauss Zelnick, denied that Intercept Games – the developer behind Kerbal Space Program 2 – had closed down. However, he refused to comment on whether Take-Two Interactive <strong>would </strong>shut down Intercept Games – among other studios.  </p>



<p>Now, posts on social media have surfaced claiming that the team at Intercept Games will be made redundant as of June 28, 2024. Weeks ago, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791236904580436176/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg obtained documentation</a> showing that Take-Two was proposing the closure of the Roll7 studio – but these notes didn’t mention Intercept.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-go-again">‘Here We Go Again’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Intercept’s Quinn Duffy posted the following:</p>



<p><em>‘Well, here we go again.<p>The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I.</p><p>I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there. These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I’m happy to vouch for their qualities. And I can say the same about the other disciplines – good folks across the board.</p><p>Kerbal Space Program 2 is a delightful game, deeply engrossing, and incredibly pretty even in its early-access state and I hope you have a chance to check it out.’</p></em></p>



<p>In 2020, Take-Two Interactive opened Intercept Games in Seattle, Washington. The team was tasked with assuming the development of Kerbal Space Program 2, which has since been review-bombed on Steam following the news of the studio closure. It boasts a recent review rating of ‘Overwhelmingly Negative’ with most comments referring to the laying off of the team by Take-Two Interactive.</p>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of shutdowns in the industry that have led to almost 20,000 workers being made redundant since the start of 2023.</p>

<p>In an all-new financial report, CD Projekt revealed that development on Cyberpunk 2077 has officially ended. In the last report, published in February, there were just 17 developers left supporting the title – and now, that number has diminished completely. More than 400 developers are working on ‘Polaris’, the next game in The Witcher series, and 56 are occupied with Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-an-era">End of an Era</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly negative reception. It was such a failed game at launch that investors pursued legal action against CD Projekt Red. Then, amid a huge and ongoing expenditure, Cyberpunk 2077 was pulled out of the gutter by the team, and hundreds of millions of dollars turned it around for the better. By the time Phantom Liberty was released in 2023 (the game’s only expansion), Cyberpunk had come to be regarded as one of the most iconic rags-to-riches stories in gaming history.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2024/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a> published by CDR confirmed that not a single developer is left working on Cyberpunk 2077. This is the first time in over a decade that nobody is supporting the game at CDPR. </p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 ended life on a high. It won a BAFTA Award for the ‘Best Evolving Game’ and secured a whopping 95% positivity rating on Steam, a remarkable number by all accounts – especially when little more than two years ago, the game boasted around a 50% positivity rating.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/engineowning-activision-court-case/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last year, Activision Blizzard saw success in the courts, with EngineOwning – arguably the most prolific cheat provider in gaming – being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-cheaters-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered to pay</a> a whopping $3 million in damages. This case concerned both Overwatch and Call of Duty, but it wasn’t the end of the debacle as AB refused to relent. </p>



<p>Now, a judge has ruled that EngineOwning owes Activision Blizzard around $15 million in damages and legal fees, based on the platform’s constant (successful) attempts to circumvent AB’s anti-cheat systems. Not only that but the court also ruled that the EngineOwning domain must be surrendered to Activision Blizzard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crime-doesn-t-pay">Crime Doesn’t Pay</h2>



<p>In this lengthy fight between EngineOwning and Activision Blizzard, thousands of gamers were named and revealed as having used EngineOwning’s cheat software. This included a slew of content creators who were effectively besmirched by the lawsuit – and their malicious activities.</p>



<p>It was claimed in the final documentation from the court case that, in the United States, EngineOwning’s software was downloaded 72,328 times. The court therefore found it ‘reasonable’ that AB sought such a high sum in damages. It was later revealed that attorney fees alone amounted to $292,912. </p>



<p>For years, EngineOwning has provided cheat solutions for Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and Titanfall – amongst other games. The company also offered a hardware ID spoofer, which circumvents one of the core functions of anti-cheat software, particularly the high-end solutions that can enact ‘hardware bans’ against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this won’t do much to slow down these malicious operators, as the video game cheating market is like a multi-headed hydra – but it’s certainly a solid blow.</p>

			<p>Sony’s <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Days of Play” celebration</a> kicks off tomorrow, and as part of that, they’re adding a bunch of new titles to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Plus</a>, including a number of “bonus” titles for Extra/Premium subscribers on top of the regular collection of games that will be added later on in June. First up, there are the standard monthly PS Plus Essential titles for June, which include SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever, and more. Here’s a rundown of the monthly Essential titles, which will be added on June 4.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>“Wish-granting Mermaid’s Tears in the hands of SpongeBob and Patrick… What could go wrong? Sure, the very fabric holding the universe together could come undone, opening portals into wild Wishworlds. But that’s nothing our favorite sponge can’t handle- with the right cosmic costume!”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Like the promotion it’s based on, AEW: Fight Forever can be a bit rough around the edges, but the game is also a welcome breath of fresh air. Fun, approachable in-ring action and an endearingly-quirky career mode largely make up for scruffy visuals and some missing content. AEW: Fight Forever won’t be for everyone, but if you’re looking for an alternative, feel free to push your chips All In.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Streets of Rage 4 (</strong>PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Streets of Rage 4 doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but honestly, that’s okay. The game’s dazzling visuals, silky-smooth action, varied level design, and sexy sense of cool more than make up for a few minor old-school irritations. Veteran Bare Knuckle brawlers will get the most out of Streets of Rage 4, but it should provide a satisfying thumb workout for players from all eras.”</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the “bonus” titles available to PS Plus Extra and Premium members…</p>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Extra</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dredge (PS4, PS5) May 29</em></li>
<li><em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 (PS4) May 31</em></li>
<li><em>Cricket 24 (PS4, PS5) June 5</em></li>
<li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition (PS4, PS5) June 7</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium Classics</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tomb Raider Legend (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (PS2) June 11</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium PS VR2 Games</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Walkabout Mini Golf – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Synth Riders – June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Before Your Eyes - June 6</em></li>
<li><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Chapters 1 &amp; 2 – June 6</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the PS Plus games above, Days of Play, with various promotions and activities, kicks off tomorrow (May 29) and runs until June 12.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-this-week-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc.883440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Sims 4, you might recall, is currently embarking on a sexy "summer of love" - which, so far, has mainly involved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">some new swimsuits</a>. Now, though, EA has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/cozy-bistro-and-riviera-retreat-kits">revealed</a> the next two items on its vaguely saucy list: the Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kit DLC, both arriving on 30th May.
</p>
<p>
First up, for those summery sunny days of relaxation and shameless undress, is the Riviera Retreat - a "secluded oasis" incorporating "stucco textures, beautiful archways, and shimmering waterfalls with comfortable linen furniture, wicker lounge chairs, and vine-covered pergolas."
</p>
<p>
This one's all about creating an "ambience of serenity and connection" for your Sims, says EA, whether reclining and rejuvenating alone or together with a smooching pal.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
As for the Cozy Bistro Kit, expect a DLC of charming "old world" streets and "hole-in-the-wall" noshing ("hole-in-the-wall" apparently being a US term for an easily overlooked establishment in case you were wondering - which I definitely was).

<p>
"With welcoming awnings, classic furniture settings, and its inviting atmosphere," explains EA, "this beloved bistro is sure to become a neighbourhood favourite." It promises amenities that can be used in a bar or lounge lot, alongside building items including tall etched glass windows and doors, polished metal accents, bistro tables and chairs, plus vintage wall decor.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kits launch for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam, the EA App, and Epic Games Store) this Thursday 30th May, where they'll likely cost £4.99/$4.99 apiece. EA says it's also adding two new builds utilising each pack - the The Cozy Bistro and Riviera Retreat Poolhouse - to The Sims 4's in-game gallery on the same day.

                <p>RPG fans who haven't picked up Star Ocean: The Second Story R are in luck. The beautiful reimagining of the classic 1998 role-playing game is on sale for an awesome price. The remake gives the beloved entry in the series a modern touch; it's an adventure that deftly bridges the gap between past and future. The Second Story R has only received a couple discounts since launching last holiday, and the current $35 price matches the all-time low--which sold out quickly at this price last time. This deal is available for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PS4 versions of the game at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r---nintendo-switch%2F20006770-6c0948f1.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r-discounted-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6522045%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>Similar to the Octopath Traveler games, Star Ocean: The Second Story R was entirely remade to be both faithful to the source material while incorporating modern elements into its design. The game makes use of 2D pixel art character sprites and places them in retro-styled 3D environments, with the final result being looking like a 4K PlayStation One game. It's a mesmerizing effect that <em>shouldn't </em>work this well but has to be seen in action.</p><p>The game also features both English and Japanese voice acting, a newly arranged soundtrack, and a high degree of replayability. Alongside several tweaks and quality-of-life changes, it strikes an ideal balance between staying faithful to the original game and giving it a welcome update for the current era.</p><p>"Star Ocean: The Second Story R is a remake that manages to not only have the retro feel of its older PS1 and PSP incarnations, but also make it feel fresh with new battle mechanics, as well as audio and visuals updates. It may not be the big break that’ll finally make the Star Ocean franchise explode in popularity, but it’s a fine Japanese RPG on its own terms," George Yang wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-review-back-to-the-future/1900-6418147/" data-ref-id="1900-6418147">Star Ocean: The Second Story R review</a>.</p><p>Star Ocean: The Second Story R isn't the only Square Enix game on sale for an all-time best price.

                <p>Official Xbox Wireless Controllers are awesome as is, but if you want a little more versatility without breaking the bank, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Vista Strikepack from Collective Minds</a> is a quick and easy way to enhance your device. The detachable gadget is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to preorder for $50 at Amazon</a> ahead of its June 3 release.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085"></a><figcaption>Collective Minds Strikepack - Horizon Vista M.O.D.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg"></figure><p>This is revitalized and updated version of previous Strikepacks, and the layout for the Horizon Vista model remains the same. What you're getting here is four programmable back buttons that can be bolted onto your controller through the battery pack, creating a fairly seamless appearance. You can still connect a USB-C cable for wired gaming and charging and a dedicated app allows you to tinker with each button to a high degree. Using the dedicated mobile app, you can set your own combos and do some more fine-tuning, making this a pretty versatile device.</p><p>The Strikepack is pretty cool since it allows you to keep using your existing Xbox controllers, but it's far from the only customizable controller option out there. Our top pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, Microsoft's premium wireless controller that offers awesome customization features and swappable components.

There's also an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1VHH4C5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upcoming 8BitDo controller for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One</a>, although this one comes with a few caveats on console and is perhaps even better suited for PC gamers. While this controller features the high build quality and flexibility of other 8BitDo Ultimate devices, you can only use it in wired mode with the included detachable USB-C cable on Xbox consoles. PC users can sync the controller using 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth, sidestepping those console shortcomings.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Your teacher once told you that you couldn't carry a calculator everywhere with you, but they were wrong! Because if they ever cast their eyes on this stylish new 8BitDo numpad/calculator hybrid, they'd have special pockets sewn into their clothes to keep it with them at all times. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QC8R4P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</a></strong> is a retro-themed piece of tech that you can either use as an extension to one of the company's matching TKL mechanical keyboards, or as a stylish piece of number-crunching equipment for when you need to do some quick math. Remember, life comes at you hard, but numbers hit you even harder.</p><p>Inspired by classic hardware, the Numpad features hot-swappable PCB keys, a retro LED display, and can be connected via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz dongle. 8BitDo says it's compatible with Windows and Android devices, and it comes in several different editions. Depending on your personal taste, you can pick one up for $45 in NES, Famicom, Commodore 64, or IBM Model M-inspired designs when it launches on July 15. It's worth noting that the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard is also marketed for Windows and Android, but it works great with Mac, Steam Deck, and other devices, too. We'd expect the Retro 18 Numpad to be the same way.</p><h3>8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QC8R4P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (N model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (C64 model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QPC1GG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro Numpad (M model)</a> -- $45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QGX9QB?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad (Fami model)</a> -- $45</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309277"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Retro 18 Numpad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309277-8bitdo-numpad.jpg"></figure><p>Even if you're not planning to add an extension to your keyboard, a dedicated calculator is always welcome around the house.

            <p>

Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games will lay off its employees at the end of June according to a senior team manager, despite Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick insisting earlier this month that the studio hadn't been shut down.
</p>
<p>
Word of Intercept Games' impending demise - and the loss 70 jobs at the studio - came earlier this month via a decidedly official <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">Washington state closure notice</a> submitted by Take-Two itself, and was corroborated by affected employees on social media. Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier - after viewing an internal Take-Two Interactive email to staff - <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios">reported</a> OlliOlli World developer Roll7 was also being closed down.
</p>
<p>
That didn't stop Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick from later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-claims-publisher-hasnt-shut-down-olliolli-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">repeatedly insisting</a>, "We didn't shutter those studios." But whatever semantic technicality Zelnick was invoking at the time, it isn't one likely to impress employees at Intercept Games.

<p>
Kerbal Space Program 2 senior design manager Quinn Duffy has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quinn-duffy_well-here-we-go-again-the-team-at-intercept-activity-7201280703215394816-uyzd?trk=public_profile">posted to LinkedIn</a> saying the Intercept team will be laid off as of 28th June. "I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there," he continued. "These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I'm happy to vouch for their qualities. And I can say the same about the other disciplines - good folks across the board."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two - perhaps unsurprisingly given its refusal to acknowledge Intercept's closure - hasn't yet commented on Kerbal Space Program 2's future. However, thousands of early access purchasers have vented their frustration as the publisher's silence continues, pushing the £44.99 game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/954850/Kerbal_Space_Program_2/">recent Steam rating</a> down to Overwhelmingly Negative in light of Intercept's reported closure.
</p>
<p>
In April, Take-Two announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">laying off five percent of its 11,000-strong workforce</a> - equating to around 550 people - and cancelling multiple in-development projects, despite Zelnick saying the company had "no current plans" to lay off staff just weeks before.

In <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>, the studio explains that it worked with the eSports legend to create an event pass celebrating his legacy. Festivities include three new Ahri Collections with prices that are turning heads.</p><p>Each bundle is more expensive than the last, beginning with the Risen Legend Collection at 5430 RP or around $40. It includes the Hall of Legends Pass, a Takedown Counter Taunt, an icon, an emote, a banner, and Ahri with a unique, orange and white skin. Next up is the substantially more expensive Immortalized Legend Collection, which costs 32430 RP or around $250, and packs in the Risen Collection along with a selection of exclusive skin transformations, finishers, the Immortalized Ahri skin, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>League of Legends Risen, Immortalized, and Signature Collections</h3></div></output><p>Finally, at 59260 RP, or around $450, there’s the Signature Immortalized Legend Collection that includes the Immortalized Collection as well as a “Final Boss Faker” title, a Faker-themed signature move and structure finisher, an exclusive border, banner, 100 pass levels, and more. It’s a lot of content with a uniquely high price tag, so it was no surprise to see players commenting on the pricing upon its reveal.</p><p>“It's crazy that Faker, known for his generosity and taking less salary over the years so he could stay in Korea, is going to be associated with these crazy packages where the base skin isn't able to transform,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d2luzd/comment/l61bhcn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “I looked at the 2 whales packages and pretty much expected like a physical Ahri statue to be included in them, but they were just a couple of finishers and signature emotes.

The Hall of Legends Pass includes multiple skins (including Risen Legend LeBlanc), emotes, and more, while the Risen Legend Collection adds the new Risen Legend Ahri skin for collectors to enjoy. For those looking to flex their fandom, the Immortalized Legend Collection and Signature Immortalized Legend Collection include spectacular additions, headlined by the evolving Immortalized Legend Ahri skin. While more expensive, these versions are meant to be highly commemorative, with never-before-implemented features that we can’t wait to see hit the Rift.</blockquote><p>The Collections arrive as part of the League of Legends Hall of Legends event. It runs from June 12 to July 8, and it's unclear if the Collections will be made available again in the future. Additional Hall of Legends events are planned to commorate other star players in the community annually.</p><p>For more on League of Legends, you can read about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-assures-players-that-new-league-of-legends-anti-cheat-software-is-not-bricking-pcs">anti-cheat software that Riot assures is not bricking PCs</a>.

Most of the discounts are expected to go live at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and GameStop--giving you plenty of places to shop in case your preferred retailer runs out of inventory. Along with discounts, you'll find new daily challenges available to PlayStation Plus members, and if the community completes the challenge, fans will unlock cool rewards.</p><p>PlayStation provided a preview of the biggest deals, but we wouldn't be surprised if more offers pop up when Days of Play officially starts. That said, we already know there will be deals on the PS5 Slim, PS5 Slim Digital, PlayStation VR 2, and a handful of exclusive games, including a few newer releases.</p><div title="6523751 - Days of Play 2024" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2408" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523751 - Days of Play 2024" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20">PS5 Slim</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$450 (was $500)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The PS5 Slim will be on sale for $50 at major retailers.

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Today, <em>Yakuza </em>— or rather, <em>Like a Dragon</em> — is pretty well known far and wide as a series of exciting, corny, and hammed-up RPGs by Sega. But history could have been much different. Back when the series was originally pitched, Sega “flat-out rejected” it.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">In <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/like-a-dragon-creator-talks-about-sega-flat-out-rejecting-the-first-yakuza-game-thinking-it-wouldnt-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> (via Automaton) with <em>Like a Dragon</em> series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi, the former series head recalled the time Sega smacked the idea off the table like a curmudgeonly cat. According to Nagoshi, Sega was desperately seeking new video game ideas with worldwide appeal. </p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">“This led to a mindset of making games that would appeal to the masses, games that could sell anywhere and to anyone. Many producers, including myself, thought this way,” Nagoshi said.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">For anyone who has played a <em>Like a Dragon</em> game, or even looked at a set of screenshots, can tell you that the saga of Kiryu Kazuma and friends ain’t that. (Even if it should be.)</p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>What’s the problem? | Image via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-like-a-dragon-came-to-be-during-a-tumultuous-time-for-sega" data-injectable="false"><em>Like a Dragon</em> came to be during a tumultuous time for Sega</h2> <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">Sega initially said no, and it’s no surprise why. <em>Like a Dragon</em>, directly translated from its Japanese name of <em>Ryu Ga Gotoku</em>, wasn’t strictly designed for Western audiences. The game took place in a small part of Tokyo, rich with attractions and references that only those fluent in Japanese culture may understand or recognize. It starred a former member of a Japanese crime syndicate who chewed corny tough-guy lines while balancing his time with a conspiracy story, taking care of a puppy, playing pachinko, and getting toilet paper for a man stuck in a park bathroom. </p>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">The series was, and still is, an eclectic blend of silliness and drama, but Sega didn’t see the potential right away. </p> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">“Of course, it was flat-out rejected,” Nagoshi explained. “After all, it was completely contrary to what I mentioned earlier about attracting the masses. Children wouldn’t be able to play it, and it wasn’t catered to women nor overseas audiences. In this sense, there was no way for it to be approved without resistance.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Nagoshi was persistent and, eventually, Sega relented. He said he was “quite forceful” in looking for approval. With Nagoshi always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI7BUZ4rgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dressing like</a> he crawled out of a <em>Like a Dragon</em> game himself, I guess I’m not shocked that Sega ultimately saw things his way.</p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">It’s not like Sega was wrong from a business perspective, mind. Back in the early ’00s when <em>LAD </em>was being pitched, Sega had already likely given up the Dreamcast and was reeling over <em>Shenmue</em>‘s disappointing sales figures. The latter was known as the most expensive game ever made — a title it held for many years. The absurd <em>Like a Dragon</em> must have been viewed as an exceptionally tough sell for outside Japan. </p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">But Sega definitely tried. The publisher went so far as to fully dub the original game in English, while bringing in Mark Hamill to voice Goro Majima, a role he may <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/10mb4kz/in_spite_of_video_evidence_and_popular_belief/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not even remember taking</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Sega</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true"><em>Yakuza</em>, as it was called when it finally came to the West, also didn’t reach mainstream appeal for many years. The fourth mainline game in the series was nearly the last to cross the seas, as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yakuza-5-is-finally-coming-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Yakuza 5</em> localization almost didn’t happen</a>. Regardless, with <em>Yakuza 0</em> and <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, the series is now firmly nestled into the zeitgeist on both the East and West. Nagoshi, however, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yakuza-creator-toshihiro-nagoshi-forms-nagoshi-studio-japan-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has moved on</a> and is making games for his new studio.</p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="false">Fast-forward a couple decades and the latest game in the franchise is a smash hit for Sega. <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-clears-one-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soared to 1 million sold</a> within a week of its launch, outpacing the sales of its predecessors (and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we loved it</a>). The series, along with <em>Persona</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, contributed to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/segas-full-year-sales-jump-20-as-persona-and-like-a-dragon-sales-surge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20% sales increase</a>, Sega announced this month. Let’s be collectively glad the company eventually said yes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166460/youtube-playables-games-play-launch-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KVqinE">YouTube launched a new feature on Tuesday: free mobile games you can play right in the app or on your desktop. After several months of testing the feature with YouTube Premium subscribers, the sub-100-game platform hybrid is now out for all users, and it’s, unsurprisingly, disappointing. </p>
<p id="O3yPx1">In order to comply with Apple’s App Store regulations, the YouTube app <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business">can’t directly compete with the App Store</a> itself — that is, it can’t sell apps or games. So Google’s YouTube is offering free games within the app itself instead, and the throttled experience does little to inspire competition with even the free games on the App Store. Rather than downloading the games you want to play, Playables essentially functions like any other website that hosts games. (If you can’t think of one, it’s probably because most games live on our hard drives or in the cloud these days — but <a href="http://addictinggames.com/">AddictingGames.com</a> is an approximation that comes to mind.)</p>
<p id="ckfsCC">That means some well-produced games, like <em>Tomb of the Mask</em>, can do things like save your progress. Others restart each time you open the game on Playables. Some include controls designed for keyboard inputs, and others make you toggle between the trackpad and the mouse. </p>
<p id="v3ugsY">Besides a few highlights like <em>Tomb of the Mask</em>, <em>Angry Birds Showdown</em>, and <em>Cut the Rope</em>, there are tens of extremely cheap games that aren’t very enjoyable to play on the desktop. (<em>Draw Climber</em>, <em>Lunch Box Ready</em>, and <em>Color Match</em> are a few examples of the, uh, <em>less polished</em> options on Playables.) They’re also a bummer to play on the mobile app since the interface cuts off about one-tenth of the screen and has no full-screen mode. The browser version’s full-screen mode simply enlarges the browser to fill the screen, rather than just the game, as if it were a YouTube video.</p>

<p id="j0m3O2">I can’t knock YouTube for finding a way to make some of these games easily and legally playable (ha) on a browser sans ads — crushing a few levels of any given web-based game between meetings brings me right back to the computer room in the mid-2000s, in a good way — but with the advent of Steam, this move feels more like Google signaling to Apple that it’s still here to compete in the digital games marketplace space, rather than a move to benefit players. I might find myself playing some <em>Tomb of the Mask</em> on YouTube’s web browser, but I’m certainly not going to play it on YouTube’s mobile app considering it’s free on the App Store. So, to keep my progress in one place, I’ll just continue playing on my iPhone.</p>
<p id="4bkE6b">In terms of the interface, there’s a lot of room for improvement. Currently, you can only filter your Playables games by “Home,” which shows games you’ve played, and “Browse,” which shows all the games available in alphabetical order. You can also search in your YouTube search bar for a game, but you’ll have to wade through a few rows of videos and ads before you get to the Playables module.</p>
<p id="cGzA3u">That, along with the poor selection of titles, speak to one of the main reasons the Google Play Store hasn’t won out over Apple’s App Store: curation. I have access to both marketplaces, and consistently I find Google’s marketplace to be bloated with crappy games that are predominantly there to get eyes on the advertisements hosted within the games. </p>
<p id="IGX0mm">The App Store has this problem, too, but Apple is notoriously incisive about which apps are allowed on the store, particularly in terms of privacy and data collection. That means games with higher production value, aka teams with more cash and time to go through the Apple vetting process, might be more likely to land on both marketplaces while low-budget, quick-hit games might only land on the Play Store.</p>
<p id="F8005l">I expect Playables to become much more populated in the coming months, meaning a lot of these early complaints could subside. I’m especially curious to see whether YouTube releases any original games, which would make a much more compelling case for me to sink more time into the platform. And while I think this Playables a smart and sneaky way to get folks playing Google Play Store games on iPhones, I don’t think it’s going to nudge the industry one way or the other — at least not in its current state. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-workers-will-reportedly-be-out-of-work-next-month/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kerbal-space-program-2-studio-workers-will-reportedly-be-out-of-work-next-month<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="439" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Back in April, Take-Two announced that it would be laying off <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 5% of its workforce</a> as part of a cost-cutting initiative. There’s been a lot of confusion around the announcement, with some reports saying that studios like Roll7 and Intercept are being shuttered, and Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick denying it. Either way, today game director Quinn Duffy has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said via Linkedin</a> that the team at Intercept are out of a job as of June 28.</p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">It’s pretty frustrating. When previously asked directly about the status of Roll7 (developer of the acclaimed <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-olliolli-world-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OlliOlli World</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/rollerdrome-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollerdrome</a></em>) and Intercept Games (<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kerbal-space-program-2-launches-into-early-access-in-rough-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kerbal Space Program 2</a></em>) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview with IGN</a>, Zelnick stated, “We didn’t shutter those studios, to be clear.”</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Despite the choice of words, this seems hardly clear. Internal reports claimed to contradict this statement. But when IGN pressed for, erm, clarity, Zelnick said, “We did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what [the restructuring] looks like.”</p>
 <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="141" data-injectable="false">I suppose it’s technically accurate that no public statement had been made, but I’d find it pretty embarrassing to split hairs over this.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkedin post</a> today, Intercept’s game director Quinn Duffy said, “The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I.”</p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">To echo what <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-denies-shutting-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-but-wont-say-if-they-still-exist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my colleague Michael Beckwith wrote</a>, I don’t see what the point of the denial is. Even a “no comment” would be more appropriate. Instead, this is like a parent telling a child they didn’t buy them a Game Boy for their birthday to keep it a surprise, but in this instance, it’s a studio being laid off. It just feels like a really insulting misdirection. Corporate executives really don’t seem to have much respect for their employees.</p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">Few announcements have been made regarding the development of <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, which is currently in Early Access. Take-Two confirmed to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> that it will continue to make updates to <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but to what extent those updates will go is unclear.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="false">The closure of Roll7 has likewise not been officially confirmed, but considering the internal note originated from that company, it feels all but certain. It’s a frustrating situation for a number of developers who are now being forced out into a competitive, struggling job market, with their previous work and livelihoods still taught on strings for show.</p>
