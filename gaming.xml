<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59d0e23303987/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>With just two days (!) remaining until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on the Switch and Switch 2, Team Cherry has provided one final <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863">Kickstarter update</a> to run through a bit of last-minute housekeeping.</p>
<p>Naturally, the update mostly concerns backers who supported the project back in the 19th century, with Team Cherry providing advice on how to ensure the correct delivery of game keys and, more specifically, what Switch 2 owners will need to do to unlock the game's full potential on Nintendo's new console.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067orugsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, Switch backers will be receiving their codes via email. Those on Switch 2 will then need to download the game itself <em>and</em> an additional free upgrade pack to unlock the enhanced features (i.e. higher frame rates, etc).</p>
<p>Otherwise, backers who have yet to complete their surveys will need to do so soon in order to receive the relevant download key. If you're one of these and you happen to miss the cut-off point tomorrow, then you can still receive your game by reaching out to the team directly. All details can be found on the Kickstarter page linked.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-has-been-officially-announced">has been priced</a> at <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> and will launch on <strong>Thursday, 4th September 2025</strong>. Specific release times, as detailed by Team Cherry, will be <strong>7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST / 4pm CEST / 11PM JST</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>POE2 player numbers have been dwindling in recent weeks. This happens to many games after their initial launch and hype. But players have flooded back to Path of Exile 2 to make player count numbers blow up—thanks to the ‘Third Edict’ update and free weekend incentive.</p>



<p>Arguably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-boss-powers-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a>‘s biggest competitor is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-build-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>. The ARPG launched to great success in December 2024. Over half a million of you flooded the Path of Exile 2 servers to see what the fuss was all about. Peak numbers were still close to the 200K mark by January 2025, and things have tailed off a bit—save for the April 2025 update.</p>



<p> However, a free weekend opportunity combined with a huge new content update has revitalized the ARPG sequel once more.</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-third-edict-update-amp-free-weekend-boosts-numbers">Path of Exile 2 Third Edict Update &amp; Free Weekend Boosts Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring back into life. Image credit: Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 was free-to-play for everyone from August 29 to September 1. Whether you own the game or don’t, everyone was entitled to download the game and try it out.</p>



<p>This was to get as many eyes and hours on the game’s Third Edict content update as possible.</p>



<p>According to the POE 2 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3826469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>: “You will get access to all the content currently available in Path of Exile 2, including the newly released Third Edict Content Update. There are no limits to character leveling, and all progress made during this period will be saved to your account. When the Free Weekend ends, you can continue playing by purchasing an Early Access key or by waiting until Path of Exile 2 becomes free to play at full release.”</p>



<p>For reference, Steam Charts says Path of Exile 2 achieved around 8,000 players on average in July 2025, with a peak of around 14,000. Whereas August 2025 saw an average of about 25,000 users, but a peak of over 352,000! The average would’ve been low throughout the whole month, up until the free weekend right at the end of the month.</p>



<p>Did you get a chance to play Path of Exile 2 during the free weekend? Are you going to continue to play it? It seems to be a bold strategy that paid off for Grinding Gear Games. If you agree or disagree, let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable social media has found traces of the first Marvel Rivals PS4 update. It’s long been suspected that a PS4 version of the superhero shooter would happen eventually, thank the Star Lord, it seems to be coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been a huge hit for NetEase Games. It’s surprising, really, as Marvel fans are insatiable for the hero shooter and anything Marvel-related in general. It takes the best of Overwatch and sprinkles in its own flair and features to make an excellent free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Many people still haven’t made the step up to current-gen hardware, and if you’re a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a> user, it might be good news for you.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, this has been uncovered: “Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version).”</p>



<p>This would suggest the first update and patch notes for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals’ debut on PS4</a>. This is the most recent update on the port, and the X page posted on August 13 with another message indicating the port was happening: “Marvel Rivals – PS4.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 4 feels like reality more than a dream, and if you are a last-gen owner, you finally get to see what the fuss is all about. Also, I’d hazard a guess that if Marvel Rivals is coming to older PlayStation hardware, then Xbox One owners might also be in luck! I’m worried about the game’s performance, but let’s hope it holds up!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates and details.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Ubisoft has confirmed that Ubisoft Milan, which was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to be working on a new installment of the franchise, is partnering with Ubisoft Montpellier on this project.</p>



<p>Loic Gounon, Brand Producer for the IP, <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595264390218129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a video message</a>:</p>



<p><em>A bit about myself: I joined Ubisoft twenty years ago, and I've been on the franchise since 2006 on projects such as Rayman Raving Rabbids, Rayman Origins, and Rayman Legends. Rayman was born at Ubisoft Montpellier back in 1995, and for the past thirty years, he has gone on many adventures thanks to studios across the world</em> <em>like Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Milan, or Ubisoft Annecy. Starting now and across our community channels, we are taking a moment to celebrate this incredible history by looking back. We will be sharing behind the scenes, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art, and more throughout the months to come. Rayman couldn't have become such a legend without all of you, the fans. You have helped to keep his legacy going, and we're incredibly thankful for that. As we said in the past, a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands.</em></p>



<p>Fans of the peculiar limbless creature must arm themselves with a lot of patience, as triple-A game development can take a very long time these days. The only tidbit we have on the project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a rumor</a> that circulated last October, when Insider Gaming said this would be a remake of a prior title. Tom Henderson is usually extremely well informed when it comes to Ubisoft, so it's likely that the info is correct and a remake, rather than a new game, is on the way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Which Call of Duty is Free?—Play COD For Free, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/which-call-of-duty-is-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-call-of-duty-is-free-%E2%80%94play-cod-for-free-explained.1286088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty has existed for more than two decades, and in that time, dozens of games have been released to flesh out the franchise. It’s arguably the most popular first-person shooter series of all time, and today, we’re helping people get a taste of it by answering an all-important question: ‘Which Call of Duty is free?’</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll outline which Call of Duty games are free and which ones you need to pay for.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-free-call-of-duty-games">Are There Free Call of Duty Games?</h2>



<p>Few franchises sell quite so many copies as Call of Duty does. It’s a titan of the gaming industry, and every year, even amidst bad press, the annual Call of Duty release tops the charts. In 2022, Modern Warfare II was released, and within ten days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had topped $1 billion in sales</a>.</p>



<p>However, as it’s a premium franchise, Call of Duty can be expensive, and typically, every new title will boast a top-tier pricing point as well as a paid battle pass and other in-game bundles and items that also cost real money. It can get very pricey, very quickly, and for some players, the need to find a free Call of Duty game arises. </p>



<p>With that in mind, which Call of Duty is free?</p>



<h2 id="h-good-news-you-can-play-call-of-duty-for-free">Good News: You <em>Can </em>Play Call of Duty For Free</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Activision</figcaption></figure>







<p>There are two ways that you can play Call of Duty for free, and they’re both dramatically popular. </p>



<p>Firstly, there’s the Warzone ecosystem. This battle-royale-backed platform features one of the most popular titles to ever emerge into the genre, boasting hundreds of millions of players and an ever-changing landscape. It debuted in 2020, and in the years that it has been active, it has seen all-new maps, modes, events, and the growth of a massive community.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Warzone (in every capacity) is free to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms – it’s also a crossplay title, which has served to unite cross-platform players. There’s a possibility that Warzone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-mwii-ported-to-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be available on Nintendo devices</a>.</p>



<p>If Warzone isn’t your kind of thing, then you can get started with the <em>other </em>free Call of Duty game – COD Mobile. This is a handheld-exclusive game that has existed since 2019, and it’s a monumental title that, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112479/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Statista</a>, secures around four million new downloads every single month.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Mobile incorporates content from several successful COD games, featuring a wide range of game modes, a battle royale mode, and plenty of customisation options. It’s free-to-play, but there are many microtransactions under the surface that fuel the development of the game itself.</p>



<p>That answers the titular question, ‘which Call of Duty is free’. There’s a battle royale platform that also includes an extraction shooter sub-mode and a mobile platform that is ever-expanding. That’s not a bad selection, considering it’ll cost you absolutely nothing to get involved with either of them!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Corsair Void Wireless v2</h5><p><span>April 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Wireless gaming headset</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Price</h5><p><span>$119.99 (currently discounted to $89.99)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Corsair’s Void line has been among my favorites for some time now —solid gaming audio, cool looks, and a price that doesn’t make my wallet cry. The Corsair Void Wireless v2, priced at $119.99, steps up from the old Void RGB Elite Wireless with a featherlight design, a mic that’s ready for prime time, and battery life that just keeps going. It’s got some quirks, especially for console players, but for PC gamers, this thing’s a steal. Let’s dive in and see what it’s packing.</p>



<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>



<p>The Void Wireless v2 rocks that bold, angular Void style—like something out of a sci-fi flick. Available in Carbon or White, it’s got RGB strips on the earcups you can tweak via Corsair’s iCUE software. It’s not subtle, but I’m here for it. At just 303g, this headset is crazy light, making it a dream for long sessions. The microfiber mesh earpads and memory foam headband feel soft and breathable, and the adjustable headband keeps it snug without squeezing your head.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Controls live on the left earcup: a power button (which also swaps between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth), a programmable button, and a volume rocker you can tap for custom tricks in iCUE. The non-detachable mic is super flexible, with enough adjustment options. Flip-to-mute is a nice touch, and the build feels solid, though the plastic-heavy frame doesn’t scream “luxury” like Corsair’s high-end stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p><span>Comfort</span><br>At 303g, the Void Wireless v2 is like wearing nothing at all. I’ve rocked it through marathons, and my ears stayed cool thanks to the breathable mesh and plush foam. Glasses-wearers like me will love the light clamping force, though the earcups can feel a bit small, sometimes brushing my ears. It’s not perfect, but it’s comfortable enough for the price.</p>



<p><span>Connectivity</span><br>This headset’s got flexibility for days: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless via a USB-A dongle (50ft range, no dropouts) and Bluetooth for phones, Switch, or other devices. Flipping between modes is as easy as tapping the power button. It works on PC, PS4, PS5, and Mac, but Xbox gamers are out of luck with this one. Additionally, there's no wired option, so be sure to stay on top of the juice left in the battery. Still, Bluetooth makes this a solid pick for bouncing between PC and mobile.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Sound Quality</span><br>The 50mm neodymium drivers (20Hz–20kHz) deliver punchy, clear audio that’s great for gaming. Bass thumps in DOOM, and mids keep footsteps and callouts crisp in Rainbow Six Siege. Dolby Atmos on PC adds some immersive flair, but it’s not gonna blow your mind. For gaming and movies, it’s spot-on, but music fans might notice the highs lack a bit of sparkle compared to pricier headsets like the Virtuoso XT. It’s not the best audio out there, but for $120, it gets the job done. Console players, heads-up: you’re locked into the default sound without iCUE.</p>



<p><span>Microphone</span><br>The mic is a straight-up star. It’s omnidirectional, Discord-certified, and picks up your voice clean and clear (-40dB sensitivity). The flexible boom lets you tweak its position to perfection, and flip-to-mute is a lifesaver for quick silences. With the foam windscreen and NVIDIA Broadcast support on PC, it’s great for team comms or casual streaming. It won’t replace a dedicated USB mic, but it’s one of the best I’ve tested at this price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Battery Life</span><br>Corsair claims 70 hours on 2.4GHz and 130 hours on Bluetooth, and I’m not arguing. I got around 65 hours with RGB off, and a 15-minute charge gave me ~6 hours of juice. Compared to the old Void’s 16 hours, this is next-level. Even with RGB cranked, it lasts longer than most competitors. The USB-C cable makes charging quick and painless.</p>



<p><span>iCUE Software</span><br>iCUE is where PC gamers get the good stuff: RGB tweaking, a 10-band EQ, Dolby Atmos, and button remapping. It’s slick but can be a bit laggy, and console players get none of this magic, which is disappointing. Also, the EQ preset cycling just says “1,” “2,” and so on—no names like “FPS” or “Movie.” It’s a small gripe, but it bugs me when I’m swapping settings blind.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Corsair Void Wireless v2 is a banger at $119.99. It’s quite comfortable, the mic’s a beast, and the battery life is basically immortal. Sound’s great for gaming, with Dolby Atmos adding some spice, though music snobs might want more. Bluetooth makes it super versatile, but the lack of wired connectivity and iCUE’s PC-only perks mean console gamers miss out on the full package. Compared to the Sony Wireless Gold 7.1 ($85) or Turtle Beach Stealth 600 ($100), it’s got a better mic and battery life, but PS5 players might want more on-headset control. If you’re a PC gamer living in iCUE, this headset’s a no-brainer. Console folks, you might wanna shop around unless you’re cool with basic audio. Either way, the Void Wireless v2 is a solid step up from its predecessor and an excellent pick for the price.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-map-leak-large-us-setting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-map-leak-shows-large-us-setting-for-%E2%80%98season-one%E2%80%99.1286064/</guid>

<p>Another major Battlefield 6 leak is circulating on social media, with the culprit uploading ten minutes of gameplay from a previously unseen map, titled either Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. The ten-minute video showcases a stunning, large map reportedly set in California, and it has been dubbed the first map to come to Season One of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>It’s a positive look, regardless of how the content has surfaced. Fans were asking for larger maps following the end of the recent open beta, and that’s exactly what this leaked map represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-battlefield-6-leak-reveals-larger-map">Latest Battlefield 6 Leak Reveals Larger Map</h2>



<p>In a ten-minute video leaked by the same source that uncovered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 battle royale map</a>, we get a walkthrough of what is either named Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. This naming convention comes from the original poster who first shared the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6ap3s/bf6s_season_1_map_badlands_video_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the linked video uploaded on Streamable:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bizarre perspective aside, the video offers a neat look at one of the larger maps coming to Battlefield 6, assumedly with the game’s first season. There are oil derricks spread across a vast, rocky area, pitted with long sight lines and many avenues that would make vehicular combat on this map a dream.</p>



<p>Another area on the map appears to house an airstrip with some hangars, and there are factory-style buildings, rolling hills, and even what looks like a small village. It’s a super diverse map with plenty to uncover. It’s the kind of thing that large-scale Conquest fans have been begging for, and I can certainly see it becoming a fan favorite at first blush.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-answers-today/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-today-september-2%E2%80%94clues-for-tuesday-813.1286061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing gets your day started in a better way than an invigorating run around today’s <em>New York Times Connections </em>puzzle. This daily word game has become a firm favorite worldwide since being released in June 2023. I’m a huge believer in keeping my brain sharp, and I can’t think of a more effective way to do that than with the NYT’s selection of mind-taxing games.</p>



<p>With that being said, today is a whole new day, and that means fresh NYT Connections hints and answers are here, waiting to be discovered and utilized. If you’re scratching your head about today’s NYT Connections, read on. I’ll help you figure out every group in today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections-and-how-do-you-play-it">What is NYT Connections and How Do You Play It?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <strong>everywhere</strong>, and it can be played either on a desktop device or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-today-s-nyt-connections-hints">What Are Today’s NYT Connections Hints?</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #814</p>



<ul>
<li>STIRRING</li>



<li>MYSTERY</li>



<li>CHRISTMAS</li>



<li>SWEARING</li>



<li>HOUSE</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>EARRING</li>



<li>EXPLETIVES</li>



<li>PLEATHER VEST</li>



<li>OUROBOROS</li>



<li>NECKLACE</li>



<li>MESH SHIRT</li>



<li>FOUR-LETTER WORDS</li>



<li>HISTAMINE</li>



<li>PROFANITY</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: New York Times</figcaption></figure>







<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words might get you ‘bleeped’ on television</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>T’was the night before… these words took center stage</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Fashion choices that scream 1993 pop culture icon</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a little ownership</em></li>
</ul>



<p>I didn’t have as much of a challenge with today’s NYT Connections words as I thought I might. That’s not always true, as some mornings I’ll be in a stupor trying to figure them out, especially the purple group, which is often <strong>obscure</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 2.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h3 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-september-2-814">NYT Connections Answers for Today, September 2 (#814)</h3>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em> </em>EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS, PROFANITY, SWEARING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, MOUSE, STIRRING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – EARRING, MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, PLEATHER VEST</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – HERRING, HISTAMINE, MYSTERY, OUROBOROS</li>
</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>



<p>How did you do? Did you get a perfect run? Let me know what your streak is looking like on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        <p>IzanagiGames—known for creating cinematic game experiences such as <em><a title="Games > Death Come True [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-come-true">Death Come True</a></em>—now teams up with Nippon TV and AX-ON, leaders in Japanese drama production, to take on the challenge of a feature-length live-action game. Starring Hiromitsu Kitayama.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>13 years ago, six girls mysteriously vanished in Akihabara—an unsolved case known as “Akiba’s Spirited Away.”</p><p>At the annual Game Show, Daiki Shinjo (played by Hiromitsu Kitayama), once hailed as a “genius creator,” boldly announces the development of a new game inspired by this very incident: AKIBA LOST. But the moment he does, strange disappearances begin again.</p><p>The cast of the game includes his sister Aoi Shinjo, who works at a maid cafe, underground idol Kokone Nagato, food writer Moe Kurosu, shrine maiden Chihiro Jimbo, cosplayer Wakana Yusa, and game streamer Yukimi Kurahashi—each a colorful icon of Akihabara’s vibrant subculture.</p><p>Yet, the story they were supposed to perform soon begins to bleed into reality.</p><p>It all begins with a threatening phone call—and the sudden disappearance of Aoi.</p><p>“Cancel the game’s development—or the tragedy will repeat itself.”</p><p>Can Shinjo finish developing the game? Can he protect his friends? Who is behind it all? And what really happened thirteen years ago?</p><p>The choice that determines the ending of this story is now in your hands.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Daiki Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama) – Game creator.</li><li>More characters will be revealed in the coming months.</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST-Ann_09-01-25_Chara_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Producer Comments</strong></p><p><strong>Shinsuke Umeda, IzanagiGames</strong> (Games: <em>Death Come True</em>, <em><a title="Games > Yurukill: The Calumniation Games [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/yurukill-the-calumniation-games">Yurukill: The Calumniation Games</a></em>):</p><p>In June 2020, we released Death Come True under the concept of a “cinematic live-action game.” Our next ambition was to create a feature-length ensemble live-action game. Over the course of five years, we built the foundation for this project, holding countless long meetings from the very beginning together with Nippon TV and AX-ON. This collaboration has led to the creation of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Veteran staff from the worlds of drama and film came together, filming day after day. Development continued after the shoot, and today, we are finally able to announce the project to the world.</p><p>In the story, the protagonist Shinjo strives to complete <em>AKIBA LOST</em> as a game creator. Similarly, Hiromitsu Kitayama, who plays Shinjo, led the team on set and helped bring this real-world version of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to completion.</p><p>With the combined efforts of IzanagiGames, Nippon TV, AX-ON, the cast, and our dedicated staff, we proudly present the feature-length multi-angle suspense drama <em>AKIBA LOST</em>. Please look forward to it!</p><p><strong>Hiroki Shibata, AX-ON</strong> (Dramas: <em>Brush Up Life</em>, <em>What Day Were You Born On?</em>)</p><p>As someone whose career has been in drama production, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to work on a live-action game.</p><p>Every day, we face countless “choices.” We select one option in front of us, then move to the next… and this infinite accumulation of decisions sometimes makes us realize, “There’s no going back now.”</p><p>At the same time, in modern society there is a prevailing sense that “speed is key—make choices quickly, act, and learn through trial and error.” There is certainly some truth to this. However, even a single wrong button press can lead to irreversible consequences. That is why I wanted to craft a story themed around the choices we make in life.</p><p>In this game, you, the player, experience the lives of seven characters, face the choices that appear one after another, make decisions, and advance the story.</p><p>The protagonist is portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama, who is active across acting, music, and other entertainment fields. Although this was his first experience in the game world, his flexibility and passionate dedication to the project inspired us greatly.</p><p>The setting is Akihabara, Tokyo, a city renowned worldwide for its subculture. What kind of endings await based on the choices made by the game creator protagonist (you)? We hope you will experience it firsthand.</p><p>We, the team behind <em>AKIBA LOST</em>, are fully committed to creating a game that can become one of your life’s choices.</p><p><strong>Hirokazu Umezawa, Nippon TV</strong> (Content <a title="Genres > Strategy [282 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a> Headquarters, Business Bureau, Music &amp; Artist Center)</p><p>When I first heard about a live-action game, my immediate reaction was: “This sounds amazing!”</p><p>Although I was completely new to the world of games, I realized that this was an opportunity to leverage television’s strengths in visual direction and story structuring.</p><p>In taking on this challenge, the expertise of IzanagiGames in game production was invaluable. The result of combining television and gaming is <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>Filming posed unique challenges inherent to games, but Hiromitsu Kitayama performed with remarkable skill and fully immersed himself in the role, bringing authenticity to every scene. His presence has become the “core” of this work.</p><p><em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a project that could only be created because of television, and could only be completed thanks to IzanagiGames. We hope you will experience the story through your own choices!</p><p><strong>Yushi Ito, AX-ON</strong> (Films: <em>A Place in the Kinki Region</em>, <em>Your World Ends with You</em>)</p><p>For many years, I have been creating dramas and films, portraying countless tears, smiles, and human lives. Now, I am channeling that experience into the world of games. The characters on the screen are not just characters—they have thoughts, struggles, and their futures change based on your choices. Moments will arise that shake your heart or tighten your chest.</p><p>This live-action game, crafted by specialists in drama and film production, is not confined to a scripted story. Every choice creates new scenes, weaving a story that is uniquely yours.</p><p>Hiromitsu Kitayama, who played the central role in this project, not only possesses exceptional acting skills but is also widely supported as an artist across various entertainment fields. His presence and expressiveness enrich the world of the game, making him essential to the live-action experience.</p><p>The completed <em>AKIBA LOST</em> is a game, yet it is also a story that allows you to experience a chapter of life. The more your emotions are engaged, the more vividly the story comes alive. We hope you will play your own drama in this world.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/izanagigames-nippon-tv-and-ax-on-announce-full-scale-live-action-game-akiba-lost-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

<p>The original 2D <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/rayman">Rayman</a> platformer debuted in 1995 and was eventually released on devices like the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. A 3D sequel followed during the Nintendo 64 generation, and the rest is history.</p>

Whether you’re a seasoned player or just starting out, knowing today’s hints and strategies can help you solve Wordle faster and improve your daily streak. Of course, that’s if you don’t mind the extra assistance. In this article, we’ll share <strong>helpful hints, tips on how to play, today’s Wordle answer (Game #1536), and yesterday’s solution</strong> for comparison.</p>



<p>To play today’s Wordle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head to the game’s website.</a> If you just want to go right to today’s answer without any tips or tricks, you <strong><a href="#h-today-s-wordle-answer-for-september-2-2025-wordle-game-1536">can click right here</a>.</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following information will include spoilers on today’s, and yesterday’s, edition of Wordle. If you don’t want the answer given to you, stop scrolling.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily online word puzzle created by Josh Wardle, who first created the game as a prototype in 2013 and released it in 2021. It challenges players to guess a <strong>five-letter word</strong> in six attempts or fewer, using clues from previous guesses. The game became a viral hit in late 2021 due to its simplicity, shareable results, and the excitement of solving a new puzzle every day. Wordle has even inspired countless spin-offs and daily challenges across social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wordle">How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players get <strong>six attempts</strong> to guess the five-letter word answer. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a trending topic online.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-do-wordle-games-reset">When Do Wordle Games Reset</h2>



<p>A new word is added to Wordle <strong>every day at 12am or Midnight EST.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-tips-on-how-to-play">Tips On How To Play</h2>



<p>While everyone has a different strategy for how they play the game to get today’s Wordle answer, there are tips and tricks you can use to help you get the daily words in as few attempts as possible.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Use a word with common vowels and consonants (like SLATE or STRAW) to reveal useful letters early.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Don’t just rearrange your first word to find the answer. If you don’t know it right away, pick a second word that uses different letters you haven’t tried yet. This will help you narrow down your options quicker.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Don’t use duplicate letters too early. If you think a word has a duplicate letter, wait until you’re more confident the letter appears twice in the word.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Wait on uncommon letters. To make it easier, try and find all the common letters first. Once you’ve ruled out any common vowels or consonants, then give letters like “J”, “X”, or “Z” a try.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hint-for-today-s-wordle-answer-game-1536">Hint for Today’s Wordle Answer—Game #1536</h2>



<p>Without giving the Wordle answer completely away just yet, here are a couple helpful hints for today to get you started:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Today’s Wordle answer starts with the letter <strong>“M”</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 2: </strong>Today’s Wordle answer has just <strong>one vowel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong> It’s another word for <strong>“power”</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Use these clues to narrow down your guesses and increase your chances of solving <strong>Wordle #1536 for September 2, 2025.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Message Teases Something Coming on September 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-message-teases-something-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-message-teases-something-coming-on-september-4.1285932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CDPR has posted a message on social media teasing <strong>something </strong>related to Cyberpunk 2077 coming on September 4. The message is in the form of a notice issued by the N.U.S.A., the fictional government in Cyberpunk 2077’s universe. It speaks about a ‘mounting cybersecurity threat’ and invites ‘netrunners’ to battle against that rising danger.</p>



<p>Many theories have surfaced, and the leading belief is that CDPR is referring to cybersecurity-related job vacancies opening up in the near future. If that’s the case, why doesn’t the post link to any job listings, and why is it referencing a date three days in the future?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-something-new-coming-to-cyberpunk-2077">Is Something New Coming to Cyberpunk 2077?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, CDPR adopted the persona of President Rosalind Myers of The New United States of America. The message the team published seemed to be asking for netrunners (a fancy Cyberpunk term for hackers) to join the N.U.S.A. and help defend against ‘viciously determined’ threat actors.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The most curious thing about this post was the header, which mentioned a date: September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not clear if this was a) posted early, b) written in error, or c) teasing something being imminently revealed on Thursday.</p>



<p>In the comments under the post, Cyberpunk 2077 fans started sharing theories. Some users believe it’s something to do with the second season of Edgerunners, while others feel it’s something tied to Phantom Liberty, the first and only Cyberpunk 2077 expansion.</p>



<p>It could be something linked to Project Orion, the next Cyberpunk game. Again, it could just be a fancy post lining up the delivery of some job vacancies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has one of the best openings of a video game ever. The remake cranks that up even further thanks to the the mash-up of modern graphics and <span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"><span tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwj_uaPDo7iPAxX0F1kFHQb7I5kQmpgGegQIJhAD"><span data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="Nobuo Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu’s classic score. I’m pleased to report the magic is still there on Switch 2. Digital Foundry said it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/digitalfoundry.bsky.social/post/3lx6fxspghc2r">might be the best-looking port on the handheld hybrid yet</a>. Nothing in my time with it led me to think otherwise. And man, does that first mission still hit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> <p>For the uninitiated, the opening mission has a former corporate solider teaming up with an anarcho-terrorist cell to blow up a power plant that is helping to kill the planet. Combined with the slick hybrid turn-based combat, it’s a perfect tutorial that also sets the big-picture stakes for the rest of the adventure.</p> <p>I briefly tested <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> at PAX West this past weekend and was relieve to see it doesn’t seem to be suffering from <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">some of the issues</a> that appear to be hindering other Switch 2 ports. Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">recently promised</a> the newest version of the RPG would run at a stable 30fps with “smooth performance and crisp visuals” and my roughly 20 minutes with the opening mission backs that up. Even in handheld mode it performed well with no obvious visual shortcomings. The game still controls great, and after <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-switch-2-remake-square-enix-release-date-1851779556">dozens of hours with <em>Rebirth</em> last year</a>, I’d forgotten just satisfying those early moments of the first game look and feel.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622098" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622098"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622098">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth noting that I didn’t have enough time to defeat the Scorpion Sentinel and make it out of the No. 1 reactor before it blows up, so I didn’t get to explore <em>Remake Intergrade</em>‘s more open and NPC-filled slums. It’s possible these portions of the game will strain it more on Switch 2. Based on that early section, though, it seems like there’s a decent chance the new hardware’s features will help it come out of the most demanding sections relatively unscathed. <em>Remake Intergrade</em> came out five years ago, but nothing about it looks “old” on Switch 2.</p> <p>Will I go back and replay it once it’s out? Not without some sort of cross-save feature, which the Switch 2 version doesn’t support. But it’s neat that another excellent game will get a second lease on life with Nintendo’s new hardware, and it doesn’t appear to be cutting any performance corners in the process. There’s no exact release date yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-s-yuffie-mission-is-1847082454">but <em>Remake Intergrade</em></a> is expected to arrive sometime over the winter.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-4-pack-of-airtags-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-wants-them-off-the-shelves-2000622093</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-4-pack-of-airtags-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-just-wants-them-off-the-shelves.1285905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple is know for keeping its prices steady, and discounts on its most popular products are basically a rarity. Still, a little digging can pay off because Amazon sometimes surprises with deals you’d never see on Apple’s official store. Take this AirTag 4-pack, for example: I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">t normally runs $99 directly from Apple, but Amazon has dropped it down to $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why would you care about a little tracker?</h2>
<p>Because losing your keys, backpack or luggage is frustrating, and an AirTag eliminates that problem with no effort. Installation takes as little as tapping it once on your iPhone or iPad, and you’re finished: it pairs up right away. Then you can slip one into your wallet, attach one to your keys or slide one into your travel bag. The <em>Find My</em> app is pre-installed on every iPhone and then shows you where your things are.</p>
<p>If you misplace them at home, the AirTag will even play a sound to help you find them. And if they’re out of reach, <strong>Apple’s global network of billion devices is behind the scenes helping guide you to them</strong>. That means if your bag is left at a café or your suitcase ends up at the wrong airport, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to track it down.</p>
<p>The beauty of this pack is that four trackers cover most of your daily essentials (and one AirTag usually sells for $29): One can go on your keys, another in your wallet, a third for your backpack and the last one for your luggage. Once installed, you barely need to think about them again. The battery lasts for about a year before you’ll have to replace it and it uses a standard coin-cell battery that you can buy at any store. Replacing it is seconds.</p>



<p>What’s also great is how well AirTags blend into the Apple ecosystem: If you already possess an iPhone, iPad, or a MacBook, you don’t need any additional software or tedious pairing processes. It is all managed with Find My. For locating when near and ultra-wideband technology gives you precise directions on your iPhone screen, leading you to within inches of what you lost.</p>
<p>On top of all that, this 4-pack has a <strong>solid customer rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars based on nearly 30,000 reviews</strong>. That amount of feedback suggests these are not a gimmick, and they are correcting actual problems. And for $69, you’re basically getting a little over $17 per tracker, and that’s quite a bargain for the added peace of mind the next time you’re running through an airport terminal or simply can’t keep track of where you left your house keys.</p>

              <p>Amazon skipped laptop deals during Prime Day, but it clearly saved the best for the back-to-school rush. And honestly, you don’t have to be a student to appreciate the kind of discounts popping up right now. Maybe the best deal is on this HP 15.6-inch laptop with Intel i3 processor, massive 32GB RAM, and great 1TB solid-state drive. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/">normal price is $2499, yet Amazon has chopped it all the way down to $499</a>: <strong>that’s 80% off and basically one-fifth of what you’d usually pay</strong>. On top of that, it carries an impressive 4.7 out of 5 rating from buyers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3843/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Consider Buying It</h2>
<p>First off, the memory and storage bundle is significantly more than you’d get at this pricing: With 32GB of DDR4 RAM, you’re not bogged down with chores on a daily level. It means having dozens of tabs in your browser open, video streaming and you still have room to breathe. And then there’s the 1TB PCIe SSD. That amount of fast storage doesn’t just give loads of space for files, movies, and software — it also gets the laptop up and running in a snap.</p>
<p>The processor inside it is built to handle everyday needs with ease: It’s an Intel N100, capable of up to 3.4GHz when Turbo Boost kicks in. Yes, it’s not a workstation beast or a gaming processor, but for project-carrying students or remote workers with conferencing apps, it delivers. Coupled with Intel UHD Graphics, it can manage regular entertainment like Netflix or even light edit work without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The display is significant as well, and in this case, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) display. It’s anti-glare to make working in bright lights or in windows less stressful and its thin bezels give you more usable screen space in a footprint that’s not intimidating. At 250 nits of brightness and with 45% NTSC color, it’s aimed at comfortable streaming.</p>
<p>Despite the big screen and powerful internals, it weighs just 3.64 pounds and measures only 0.73 inches thick. That makes it easy to slip into a backpack or carry between classes or office meetings. The inclusion of WiFi 6E keeps you connected quickly and dependably and Bluetooth 5.3 has you pairing headphones and other peripherals effortlessly. The laptop adds a couple of ports as well: a USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack.</p>
<p>Plugged into Windows 11 Pro, this machine is ready for work right out of the box. You’re greeted with a bare-bones interface, Microsoft’s latest apps, and business-class features that help with security and workflow on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>All of that for $499, and you can see why this buy is so surprising.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A little over two years ago, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the foundation of T-Minus Zero Entertainment, an Austin-based game developer featuring an ensemble of former BioWare and Bethesda veterans. However, last week founder and studio head Rich Vogel (Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Doom, New World, Halo Infinite) announced <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/t-minus-zero-entertainment_an-update-on-t-minus-zero-every-journey-activity-7365874626570170369-U_ZD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via LinkedIn</a> that the partnership with NetEase has already ended:</p>



<p><em>We deeply appreciate NetEase for providing us with both ample runway and support - from helping us find potential investors to giving us the time and budget to develop our game into a fully playable hands-on demo. It has generated a lot of interest. However, despite this progress, current market conditions have prevented us from securing the funding we need at this time.</em></p>



<p><em>In these moments, you can't help but reflect on how our team has overcome obstacles and transformed them into something groundbreaking. The dedication and passion each team member brought were the foundation of our success. The amount of work we achieved in creating a playable demo was truly impressive, demonstrating the strength of what our team can accomplish. We recognize that now may not be the best time to seek funding given today’s climate, but our playable demo proves our potential to develop something fresh and exciting that will resonate with players for years. We take pride in the solid foundation we’ve built together.</em></p>



<p>Speaking to Game Developer, NetEase <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-shuts-down-rich-vogel-led-t-minus-zero-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> that T-Minus Zero Entertainment is shutting down, although it added that it is helping the studio 'explore next steps' and provide support. </p>



<p>As the founders had revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive Wccftech interview from September 2023</a>, the studio was working on a third-person online multiplayer action game based on a sci-fi IP available in the public domain. During that chat, they teased ambitious, never-before-seen features.</p>



<p>A few more details about the project were shared in the comments of the aforementioned LinkedIn announcement by Simon Zhu, former President of Global Investments and Partnership at NetEase:</p>



<p><em>Their project delivers great fantasy of fighting against 15th floor kaiju to protect the city you care about. It is a loss for players if the game would be on their hands. Great team and project.</em></p>



<p>It sounds interesting enough as a pitch, especially since it was never fully realized in a recent game. Unfortunately, we might never play it, just like several other NetEase projects that <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got their funding cut earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer "focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for default users."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> doesn't have ray-tracing, and its developer has said there are no plans to add the feature down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ray-tracing has been notably missing from Battlefield 6's open beta tests, it wasn't entirely clear if this was just because the game was in beta or if it was a deliberate choice. Turns out, it's the latter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a popular inclusion in some games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-ray-tracing"><u>ray-tracing's more natural method of simulating lighting</u></a> can also prove to be draining on your PC or console's system resources — and it's for this reason that the competitive shooter won't include it. Indeed, Christian Buhl — studio technical director at Ripple Effect, one of the studios working on Battlefield 6 — has told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comicbook</u></a> that while the PC version of Battlefield 6 will have over 600 different options in its settings menu, "ray-tracing won’t be one of them and there’s no plans to bring it into the game in the near future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either,” Buhl said. “That was because we wanted to focus on performance.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hell is Us</em>&nbsp;is a strong narrative that explores an alternate history within the world of Hadea. Set in the 1990s, the country is besieged by strange creatures amidst a civil war. It's not a game for everyone, however, as the darker subject matter may be hard for some to play through. Read on for a full rundown in our&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us&nbsp;</em>review.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Hell is Us&nbsp;</em>Review | Aliens and Alt. History</h2>

<p>You play as a man returning to the country of his birth, Hadea. While you search for the fate of your parents and why you were sent away, you encounter the Hollow Walkers, a strange enemy of unknown origin. These are the only enemies you'll battle in the title, with all their variations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Combat is one of the main mechanics in&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us.&nbsp;</em>Defeating Hollow Walkers and their linked Lymbic manifestations lets you rescue citizens, collect useful upgrade materials, and close the creatures' way into Hadea. You can wield two sets of weapons, each customized with different abilities, allowing you to adapt to different battles and your playstyle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a built-in health restoration mechanic for consecutive hits without being damaged. Get the timing down and you'll remain fighting fit through all your explorations. You can also dodge and parry, with additional effects for executing a perfect dodge. While I thought the default difficulty setting was fulfilling, you can switch the settings from the main menu to make it easier or harder, depending on your preference.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-key-art-terror-trials-plains-of-mist.jpg?itok=mCikn8tT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-key-art-terror-trials-plains-of-mist.jpg?itok=MnJnwpXf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Combat might be fulfilling, but learning how to Parry, when you can add Glyphs to your weapons, or getting a handle on the different weapons available, can be difficult. With the open world design, you can easily skip over relevant information or items that can help you excel in battle. Following the main investigations will ensure you learn all you need to know about the different game systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a way to explore the world without being extremely dialogue-heavy or dumping everything on you at once, there are multiple Good Deeds and Mysteries to complete. These act as the side quests, ensuring you explore the nine regions as thoroughly as possible. You'll earn upgraded combat items for finishing Good Deeds, adding a nice incentive and way to score higher-tier equipment early in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The highlight is the story, though the subject matter may turn some players' stomachs. Yes,&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us</em>&nbsp;is a mature game that gives a warning on the general triggers you may run into while playing. Those aren't extremely detailed. You will encounter discussions involving religious persecution, authoritarianism, genocide, war, and sexual assault.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The references are found throughout the country of Hadea, from quests to dialogue with NPCs. It slaps you in the face, but it's also subtly interlaced into the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some parents may allow their teenagers to play mature games, but this title should receive a second glance. The material is heavy, and processing through it can be difficult for anyone. Just be prepared for tough scenes throughout the storyline, it's not just war violence and battles with strange creatures you'll experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Downfall of&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us</em></h2>

<p><em>Hell is Us</em>&nbsp;is a strong narrative alternate history RPG. Its realistic environments, connection to actual events, and lore-centered items ground the story. With strong roots, there are few things the title does badly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest of these is the lack of jumping. You cannot jump at all in&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us</em>. This can, and does, lead to you having to go around small fences, take the long way up a cliff, or have to backtrack to their original point again. This includes getting over small rocks and other significant bumps on the path.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-press-kit-images.jpg?itok=EbJ4W4C6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-press-kit-images.jpg?itok=T0mvySMB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Not being able to jump caused me to go around in circles time and time again after sliding down a small ledge, falling during combat, or when I took the wrong turn. It's a frustrating element that could have been addressed in a different manner to not feel so impactful.</p>

<p>Along with the lack of jumping, there are some instances where you can fall off a platform or a ridge and get stuck among environmental objects, like barrels or stones. Since you can't jump, you can't get out. Loading up the save from the main menu is the only way I got unstuck when this happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, during long play sessions of&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us</em>, the title would slow down or freeze up completely. It was rare, but when it occurred, I had to hard shut down and lost whatever progress I had made.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Hell is Us</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Hell is Us</em>&nbsp;is a deeply impactful RPG that focuses on the darker side of humanity. There's extensive lore, interesting tidbits to find in every location, and different ways to interact with Hadea. The environment is beautifully detailed, but some can be confusing to navigate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mature subject matter gives&nbsp;<em>Hell is Us&nbsp;</em>its narrative strength, but it's also hard to digest at times. Be prepared for themes spanning multiple types of violence. It may not be to everyone's taste.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from the lack of jumping, which causes a lot of frustration, there are few glitches that impact it. Overall, this is a solid entry in the RPG genre.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced the next PlayStation State of Play event, and it's coming up soon and focused exclusively on the upcoming James Bond game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, from Hitman developer IO Interactive.</p><p>The State of Play takes place Wednesday, September 3, starting at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM BST / 8 PM CEST. The broadcast will feature "over 30 minutes" of gameplay for the upcoming title, including a playthrough of Bond's first mission when he becomes an MI6 recruit.</p><p>"The action includes everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts. Stay tuned after the playthrough for insights from IO Interactive on the intense espionage gameplay," the developer said.</p><p>You will be able to watch the State of Play in all the usual places, including YouTube and Twitch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3S4qXOarxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o3S4qXOarxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The State of Play event in June featured 007 First Light's reveal trailer, so once again, Sony has the scoop on the latest information for the James Bond game. The connection between Sony and James Bond goes back a long time. Sony Pictures has been the longtime distributor of James Bond movies, but Amazon MGM Studios is taking over for the next movie.</p><h2><strong>When was the last State of Play?</strong></h2><p>The last State of Play took place it July and was focused on Ghost of Yotei. This will be the fifth State of Play so far in 2025.

There have been numerous James Bond video games over the years, of course--including the iconic GoldenEye 007--but 007 First Light is the first to tell an origin story for the world-famous character.</p><p>007 First Light has players stepping into the shoes of James Bond when he's 26 years old and in the Royal Navy, prior to becoming the British superspy everyone knows today. He gets recruited for MI6 and eventually its elite 00 section.</p><p>"Bond's adventures will take players all around the globe, coming face to face with allies and foes (or in some cases, both), while choosing how they overcome obstacles and challenges, whether it be with brute force, cunning guile, or charming wit," the game's press release said.</p><p>"We're pouring our energy and passion for the franchise into creating a cinematic adventure that pushes the boundaries of what a James Bond game can be, while telling a fresh, new story," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-fgtpwEMPM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i-fgtpwEMPM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The third-person action-adventure game will feature other characters like M, Q, and Moneypenny, as well as a brand-new character created for the game, John Greenway, and a mysterious character named Isola. And of course, IO is promising "a whole new cast of villains."</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that First Light won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>IO has not confirmed who is playing James Bond in First Light, but fans believe they've worked it out, saying they believe Irish actor Patrick Gibson is playing the role. He's known for his roles in The Tudors, Shadow and Bone, and Tolkien. Most recently, he played a young Dexter Morgan on the Dexter prequel series Original Sin. Indeed, Gibson certainly looks the part. But anything is possible.</p><p>First Light is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-new-community-vote-features-drivers-shrooms-and-more.1285818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s Community Vote 2 is now live, and players can choose between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms for the next major update. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 developers are building the game for the community, hosting new community votes for every upcoming major update. In the last vote, players had the option to choose between Rival Cartels, Police Expansion, and Shrooms, and after the voting period was over, the update finally arrived in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2025</a>. Now, a second round of voting has begun for new features in Schedule 1. </p>







<p>From <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546744790793847544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a>, September 1, to the upcoming weekend, Schedule 1 players will be able to participate in Community Vote 2 through the game’s main menu. The results will be announced shortly after the voting period is over, and they will also be displayed in the main menu. </p>



<h4 id="h-shrooms-return">Shrooms Return </h4>



<p>The new community vote brings back Shrooms as an option. This feature will allow players to manufacture and distribute a new drug type, Magic Mushrooms. The update will feature the “funky new drug”, unique equipment, new effects, and a new supplier. </p>



<h4 id="h-fishing-minigame">Fishing Minigame</h4>



<p>One of the newer options in the community vote is Fishing, which will introduce a fishing minigame. If this option wins the vote, players will be able to “reel in fish (and maybe some other&nbsp;<em>special</em>&nbsp;items)” that can be sold at Randy’s Bait &amp; Tackle. Moreover, the update will introduce new ingredients and effects. </p>



<h4 id="h-hireable-drivers">Hireable Drivers</h4>



<p>Lastly, we have a feature focused on convenience in Schedule 1’s community vote, specifically for hireable drivers. If this feature wins the vote, players will be able to transport items between their properties, businesses, and dealers. Moreover, players can designate automatic transit routes and specify the required conditions (e.g., number of items in the vehicle) for a route to begin. The update will also bring some QOL improvements to the delivery system.</p>



<p>In other news, we are yet to hear more about Schedule 1’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port</a> since the update in April 2025. Which feature will you be voting for in Schedule 1’s community vote 2? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
