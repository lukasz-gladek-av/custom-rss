            <p>
When a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>, with its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> creators and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-highguards-website-goes-dark-a-report-emerges-that-the-not-so-indie-shooter-was-funded-by-tencent">reported Tencent funding</a>, comes out and just kind of flops, you have to wonder what happened to get it to this point. Well, a new report from Mr. Scoop himself Jason Schreier over at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> appears to have shed a bit of light on the whole palaver through speaking with former Wildlight staffers. 
</p>
<p>
The story goes way back to 2021, when several devs working at Respawn decided to quit to start their own studio, partially for some creative freedom, but with this new report also claiming that part of the reason was simply about money. Specifically, Apex Legends made a whole bunch of it, and its makers felt they weren't getting an even share, so intended for their new studio to include a profit-sharing program, which is part of what helped to bring in several other Respawn staffers.
</p>
<p>
Apparently around two years into development, Wildlight knew that their game wasn't working and was too big in scope, so in January 2024 they began to refine it into what ultimately came to be. There were apparent hopes to develop single-player stories set within the same world, with Highguard serving as a starting point for expansion further down the line.
</p>
<p>
When it came to testing, it was quickly found that the game was only really fun with mics on, and Wildlight staffers said it was a much worse experience without voice chat. Members of the team did apparently suggest conducting tests from the game to start building a community, but management would always shoot this down, hoping to recreate the same success they found with Apex Legends, i.e. keeping it a secret and launching it right after announcing it. 
</p><p>
It's worth noting that the devs at Wildlight felt positive about working at the studio, until the last couple of months around launch, where morale struggled and many started to question the choice for the surprise launch. This launch ultimately didn't work, despite a pretty strong start, but despite the struggle staff believed there was enough money to allow them to keep working on the game to address any issues. But in mid-February, staff were told there wasn't any money, with many believing that the financial support from funders was based on hitting particular metrics the game had failed to meet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirm-layoffs-after-level-designer-claims-most-of-the-team-have-been-let-go">ultimately resulting in layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
A number of former staffers apparently pinned the game's more-or-less failure on the "hubris" of leadership believing they could repeat the success they found with Apex Legends. Now, apparently less than 20 devs are continuing to work on Highguard at Wildlight, with a new mode having arrived <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613785064243442?l=english">just today</a>. In the world of live service, however, 20 people does not seem like enough to keep a game like this going for particularly long. Good luck to those out of work, and those still in it.

		<p>Here’s a mouthful of a game title for you. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction has been given a release date by developer Bitmap Bureau and publisher Limited Run Games, with the side scrolling beat ’em up set to release of April 28th. To mark the announcement you can check out a new gameplay trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="He-Man and the Masters of the Universe™: Dragon Pearl of Destruction | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9Fr8DPSD9E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction says, <em>“As Eternia prepares for the Royal Festival of Light, Hover Bots attack the palace, revealing the dastardly plan: Skeletor and his allies kidnap King Randor and Queen Marlena and steal the Dragon Pearl! At Castle Grayskull, Skeletor drains the Sorceress’ power into the Pearl, shattering it across the kingdom and leaving her weak. Our heroes, He-Man, Teela, and Man-at-Arms, pursue him across Eternia in this authentic 16-bit tale of sword and sorcery, one 40 years in the making!”</em></p>
<p>For She-Ra fans, worry not as she is an unlockable character that can be used in the campaign. Each character has their own fight style, and He-Man can even ride Battle Cat into battle to take on Skeletor’s minions. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction will feature 12 stages to play through with two player local co-op supported. The game has been confirmed for PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855222/qualcomm-hints-we-might-see-windows-gaming-handhelds-at-gdc-in-march">Qualcomm hinted to <em>The Verge</em></a> that it might finally bring its powerful Arm-based Snapdragon processors to Windows gaming handhelds at the 2026 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco — just in time to challenge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/867056/leak-nvidia-n1-n1x-laptops-lenovo-dell">Nvidia’s own first Arm gaming CPU</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu">Intel’s first dedicated handheld gaming chips</a>.</p></div><p>But plans have shifted, Qualcomm now tells me. It won’t announce any updates to its Snapdragon G Series gaming chips there, nor offer the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853851/qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-plus-elite-laptops-price-ces-2026">recently announced updates to the Snapdragon X line</a> for journalists to try or benchmark.</p><p>“Snapdragon X Series and Snapdragon G Series processors are pushing the PC, desktop, and handheld gaming device industries forward. Our commitment remains strong, and we can’t wait to share more information about these areas,” reads part of a statement to <em>The Verge </em>via Qualcomm spokesperson Cassandra Garcia-Bacha.</p><p>Qualcomm didn’t say why plans have shifted, but it’s not hard to imagine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880812/ramageddon-ram-shortage-memory-crisis-price-2026-phones-laptops">that RAMageddon </a>might have something to do with it. In Qualcomm’s February earnings call, president and CEO Cristiano Amon attributed a big dip in its chip business “100 percent” to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880812/ramageddon-ram-shortage-memory-crisis-price-2026-phones-laptops#:~:text=likely%20to%20define%20the%20overall%20scale">likely define the entire scale of the phone industry</a> all year long.</p><p>In that same call, Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala testified that the company has already seen device manufacturers reduce how much they’re building. “We just wish there was more memory,” said Amon.</p><div><p>And we’ve already seen other impacts in the handheld gaming space. Valve’s Steam Deck is largely sold out; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/885012/the-steam-deck-is-missing-its-fourth-birthday-except-in-the-uk">it all but missed its fourth birthday,</a> February 25th, because it says the shortages are preventing the company from keeping it in stock. They will also impact <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/874196/valve-steam-machine-frame-controller-delay-pricing-memory-crisis">the Steam Machine</a>, and may reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/879668/sony-playstation-nintendo-switch-2-console-memory-shortage">impact the Switch 2 and delay Sony’s PS6.</a></p></div><p>But the Windows gaming handheld delay could also have something to do with Microsoft, which has worked very closely with Qualcomm on previous Windows on Arm launches and tightly controls partner announcements. Microsoft just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/882326/read-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-first-memo">a new gaming CEO</a>, who is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/884081/new-xbox-ceo-the-plans-the-plan-until-its-not-the-plan">still figuring out her entire strategy</a> for Xbox.</p><div><p>Either way, RAMagedddon is expected to get worse, not better, in the second half of the year. Today, IDC just forecast <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/885638/smartphone-decline-ram-shortage-idc">the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments</a>, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. Samsung just announced new phones <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/884239/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-price-specs-gemini">that start $100 pricier than last year for minor updates</a>, and a Samsung exec told me today that’s partly due to RAM.</p></div><p>Whenever they arrive, there seems to be potential for Arm gaming devices running Windows titles. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">Valve has quietly been the architect</a> of a push to bring Windows games to Arm, and the early results are promising.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/885314/qualcomm-wont-be-announcing-windows-gaming-handhelds-at-gdc-after-all]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new beat ’em up game set in the world of He-Man now has a release date. Get ready to battle across Eternia when He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction releases on April 28, 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/limited-run-games/" id="3641">Limited Run Games </a>announced the release date in a new gameplay trailer during IGN Fan Fest. The trailer’s description noted that there would be 12 stages in the game. Players can choose between four playable characters: He-Man, She-Ra, Man-At-Arms, and Teela. Also, local co-op mode is advertised.</p>



<p>Check out the full trailer, which feels like it stepped right out of the ’80s, below:</p>

<h2 id="h-beat-em-ups-featuring-nostalgic-ips-are-all-the-rage">Beat ‘Em Ups Featuring Nostalgic IPs Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction attempts to capture the gaming style of the late 80s and early 90s through its sprite work and mechanics. However, it is far from the only game resurrecting nostalgic IP with such a video game. Marvel Cosmic Invasion gave new life to Marvel Comics’ heroes with this game style in 2025. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind and G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra all take a similar approach.</p>



<p>Limited Run Games is also responsible for bringing back a lot of classic beat ’em up games. They recently released the Fighting Force Collection, revitalizing that PS1-era classic duology. Also, they recently announced the Marvel MaXimum Collection. </p>



<p>This forthcoming collection of games will allow players to purchase classic titles from the 16-bit era, such as X-Men: The Arcade Game and Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Maximum Carnage. Learn more about the upcoming collection <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-maximum-collection-includes-x-men-arcade-and-more/" id="180260">here</a>.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide any information regarding He-Man &amp; the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction leading up to its release. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I first took notice of Samson: A Tyndalston Story when its team of former Just Cause and Mad Max developers posted a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser</u></a> of Tyndalston itself. The fictional city reminded me of GTA 3’s Liberty City or Max Payne’s New York. My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ex-just-cause-devs-samson-aims-to-be-like-mad-maxpayne"><u>first look at proper gameplay</u></a> in a demo with the creative director only upped my interest, and now that I’ve had the chance to actually play Samson – albeit only for an all-too-brief hour – I’m officially amped for this gritty, grimy, run-down brawler with pseudo-open world freedom where your heavy punch can drop bad guys in one bloody shot and you pop painkillers to stay in the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup for this 1990’s-set crime story sees you as Samson McCray, fresh out of prison after eating a charge as a result of a robbery in St. Louis gone bad. Your sister, Oonagh, pulled some strings to help keep you safe while you were inside, and she cut a deal upon your release: you’ve got to repay the money lost from the failed heist to people that will absolutely kill you both if you come even one cent short. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s important to make clear up front is that Samson is not a AAA game. You’d be forgiven for thinking it was at first glance, because its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are quite impressive, both in terms of Samson’s character model and the city of Tyndalston. Lighting has a very fluorescent-tinged yellow tint to it that you really had to live through the ‘90s to understand, vehicles look great, and the city itself looks very, very lived-in. But Samson doesn’t have the scope of a AAA game, and that’s not a complaint – it’s just important to properly calibrate your expectations. The opening cutscene is not a full-blown cinematic but a voiced-over motion-comic, voice acting is so-so at best, and this isn’t a 40+ hour open-world sandbox. You do plenty of driving around a neighborhood – perhaps more of Tyndalston unlocks the further into the story you progress – but this is not a massive playground full of chatty NPCs and side activities. </p><p>I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, this isn’t a complaint, but it’s important to emphasize because when you first fire up Samson, it seems like it’s following a very GTA-esque playbook. But I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. For instance, there are numerous little things around the world to take note of and interact with, from notes and photos in your apartment to sandwich-board signs you can knock over with your car in order to gain small bursts of nitro boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It gets better: there is a progression system. The more bad guys you beat up and the more missions you complete, the more XP you earn that gets redeemed for a point in one of four skills: Instinct (boosts your adrenaline), Tactics (health), Aggression (power), and Cunning (finesse). This allows you to tailor your Samson to your preferred playstyle, whether you’d rather absorb and dish out maximum punishment in each fight or strike quickly and frequently in order to speed up the maxing out of your adrenaline meter, at which point you can click in both thumbsticks and enjoy a brief period of dealing extra damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay segments are split into days, and within each day are afternoon, evening, and night. Every time the sun rises, you have to pay back a certain amount of your debt. In order to do that, you’ll need to take various small jobs around Tyndalston. Fortunately, you’ve got choices each day; it’s not a linear mission structure. My first job involved finding the manager of a club called Chubb’s and, well, beating the crap out of him. Naturally, it wasn’t quite so simple. I had to worm my way through the bowels of the club first, fighting my way through his goons in the process. This mission functioned as a bit of a tutorial, allowing me to practice parries, dodges, light punches, heavy punches, and triggering my adrenaline meter after I’d built up enough adrenaline during fights. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn’t hurt Samson’s chances of me loving this game when the <em>very first dude </em>I threw a heavy punch at dropped immediately, his face covered in his own blood. Most of the time in a game like this, guys can take an unrealistic number of hits. But not in Samson. Not everyone will hit the floor after a single punch, but the fact that it can happen not only made me feel like a badass, but it added to the underworld grittiness that is clearly oozing out of every square inch of Tyndalston.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, back to the missions: as I was saying, you’ve got choices at each segment of the day, but each choice takes a certain amount of time. Meaning, you can’t just do a dozen jobs in a single day in order to quickly pay down your debt and break the game. Every job, realistically, takes time, so when I was, for example, shadowing Dave the Bookie, that took all afternoon of in-game time. First I had to drive to where Dave had last been seen. Then, once I’d clocked him, I had to follow him from a safe distance (lest he recognize the tail and get spooked, triggering a mission failure) so that he’d lead me to evidence of what he was suspected of by the people that I took the job from: that Dave was playing both sides. Sure enough, I caught Dave red-handed, and then I had to square up against Dave and his associates. By the time it was done and I got paid, the day moved to evening.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson: A Tyndalston Story - February 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some jobs can only be taken at certain times of day. And some jobs will cost you money. Like when I had to take out the cars of two guys who were avoiding my temporary employer. First I drove to where they’d last been seen, and then both cars came flying around the corner in front of me and the chase was on. The problem was, my car was already pretty beat up from the erratic driving I’d been doing in previous jobs. So the first time I tried the mission, my pursuit led us to a freeway onramp, where I was able to get behind the closest of the two target cars, and then nitro-boost directly into his rear bumper, slamming his car into the curving wall of the onramp and taking it out. Problem was, the bumper boost also took my pre-battered car out, and by the time I’d grabbed another car, the second of the two cars I was pursuing – who was already in front of me – had gotten away. </p><p>The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the retry, I stopped at a gas station repair shop first, spent some of my hard-earned cash (which, I remind you, I needed every cent of to try and make my daily debt payment), and was then able to keep my car intact while taking out both of my four-wheeled targets. I got paid, and headed home for the evening. But who was waiting for me? Two debt collectors, and so before I could crash on my own couch for the night, I had to bloody my knuckles one more time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-01-1772065215823.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Both combat and driving were a lot of fun in my one-hour hands-on. I have no idea if Samson will ever introduce guns into the mix, but I kinda hope it doesn’t. The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way, meaning that Samson takes shots just as hard as he dishes them out. I like the mix of punches, parries, and dodging. Sure, the Batman: Arkham combat arguably remains the brawler standard, but Samson’s fisticuffs are slower and more deliberate in a way I quite enjoy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving, meanwhile, also has a welcome weight to it. All of the (fictional) cars in Samson are ‘90s era at the newest, given the ‘90s setting. Samson’s own car is a ‘70s Chevelle-like two-door muscle car, and as such it’s no light Lotus. Are these simulation-style driving physics? Absolutely not. You have the aforementioned nitro boosts and there’s a side-slam button – and of course, the B button lets you pull off sick handbrake turns once you’ve got some practice under your belt. By the end of my hour I had really started to get the hang of the driving and was eager to zip my way around Tyndalston some more. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-city-02-1772065237509.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell by now, I had a fantastic time in Tyndalston. If Samson can keep its mission variety fresh – which is no small thing, I recognize – it’ll go a long way towards making its campaign enjoyable over the long haul, versus the extremely fun hour I had with it. I’m curious to see if the city opens up more as the story unfolds, and I hope the story itself is engaging enough to keep me motivated to continue playing and isn’t just “keep doing jobs to pay down your debt until a big climactic mission happens at the end.” Samson is due out on April 8 for PC, so it won’t be too long before we find out if it can keep up the good stuff it’s got going for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And the lucky bachelor and bachelorette are...</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a 10th anniversary video</a> revealing, among other things, two brand new marriage candidates being added to the game in the upcoming patch 1.7: Clint and Sandy.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/stardew-valley-10-year-anniversary-video-retrospective-new-spouse-reveal-22-44-screenshot-1772133843072.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Clint has long been a requested bachelor by the Stardew Valley community. As the valley blacksmith, he's the one who upgrades all the player's tools and opens geodes for them, meaning visiting him regularly is pretty common. But players have wanted to romance him largely because of his awkward relationship with an existing marriage candidate, Emily. Clint has a huge crush on Emily that remains unrequited even the player doesn't marry Emily, but has a few scenes where he seems downright hurt if they do. Giving Clint more of a storyline that his current tactiturn, awkward lines is a much-needed change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandy has also been a requested marriageable villager. She's the manager of the Oasis in the Desert, meaning players don't usually see her until they've played for a while. And unfortunately she never actually leaves the Oasis, so there are fewer opportunities for interactions with her. However, she's kind to the player, leaving the fandom hungry for more Sandy storyline and more interactions with her, which they'll certainly get now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, ConcernedApe opened the video by showing off some old builds of Stardew Valley (then "Sprout Valley") along with his own commentary. The sequence begins with the game's original 2012 look, six months into development, when he had a "functioning game" that was very rudimentary, and similar to the original Harvest Moon game. Even so, you can see how much the basic design of the game looks very similar, right down to where things are located in Pelican Town, the bus, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stardew Valley 10th Anniversary Early Development Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, he shows off a 2013 build that looks a looooot more familiar. The art has been significantly updated to roughly the style of current Stardew Valley. ConcernedApe says this version of the game (now titled "Stardew Valley") was more sandboxy than the current version of the game and less RPG. Additionally, the mines were procedurally generated, and you had to mine into the walls to find ore and secrets. This ended up being too complicated, "too ambitious of a concept for the scope of this game. This should have been a whole game on its own", ConcernedApe said. He also showed off an underground Goblin Village that was totally scrapped. "Just because an idea sounds cool doesn't mean it's fun or the right idea in practice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, ConcernedApe said that nothing in these early builds should be considered "canon" in the Stardew Valley universe.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2014's build introduced the Community Center, but other staples such as Joja Mart and Hat Mouse hadn't been added yet. You also couldn't decorate the inside of your house yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And another build from August 2015, half a year from launch, shows "how much of this came together at the last moment." To my eye, this looks almost identical to launch day Stardew Valley, but ConcernedApe points out various changes like the location of the mailbox, the shape of the inside of the player's house, and the final look of the main character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a reflection on the game's launch, ConcernedApe talks about what the release of the game was like for him and meant to him, including sharing that the game sold just under 40,000 copies in the first day alone, at which point he knew it would be a success. He ended the video with a recap of the game's updates over the years, and by thanking the community for its support over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.7 is coming at a later date. ConcernedApe didn't reveal any further details as to what it might entail for now, but today's announcement should tide everyone over for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today is Stardew Valley's 10th anniversary, and we celebrated earlier this month already by interviewing ConcernedApe about topics such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-uses-harry-potter-to-explain-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show">why there isn't a Stardew Valley TV show</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-still-has-1-secret-players-have-never-found-creator-concernedape-confirms">one secret left that the Stardew Valley community has yet to find</a>.

		<p>Total Mayhem Games has announced the next entry into the We Were Here series with the reveal of We Were Here Tomorrow. We Were Here Tomorrow is its own standalone entry in the series, and does not have story links to the previous games. It also features two player online co-op so players can work together to explore the mysterious facility they find themselves in.</p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here Tomorrow - Official Announcement Trailer | Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEruovfOaKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for We Were Here Tomorrow says, <em>“In this next standalone entry of the We Were Here series, you and your partner wake up inside a mysterious facility. Strange machinery surrounds you, and a calm, confident voice guides you through a series of assignments. Often separated and equipped with different tools, you’ll need to rely on your walkie-talkies to communicate clearly and work together. Each assignment introduces new asymmetrical puzzles that can only be solved through cooperation with your fellow explorer. As you progress, you’ll slowly uncover why you ended up here and what your role is within the facility. Only by working together can you decide the fate of Tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p>Aside from the two player co-op, We Were Here Tomorrow will also feature asymmetrical puzzles, the two characters having distinct roles and abilities, and a facility that has a retro-future design to it. We previously reviewed the last entry to the series <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/08/we-were-here-forever-review/">We Were Here Forever</a>, and in our review Stefan said, <em>“We Were Here Forever certainly grew on us the more we played, with some great brain-teasing puzzles that really make the most of the split player perspectives (though we did give up on the walkie-talkies).”</em></p>

<p>We Were Here Tomorrow is going to release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with an aim of releasing this year but a concrete date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch server slam went live earlier today. Over 100,000 players immediately flocked to give Bungie’s new extraction shooter a try for free on PC and console. Naturally, they immediately tried to type<em> “</em>Arc Raiders,” the name of the game’s biggest genre rival, into chat. You’ll never guess what happened next.</p> <p>Yes, <em>Marathon</em> censored the game name. Typing <em>Arc Raiders</em> into your squad’s group chat returned “*** *******” instead. One Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lirik/clip/FriendlyEnchantingOpossumRalpherZ-HA7GJI8yzhJd3Uw9">streamer’s clip</a> showing the censorship has already started making the rounds online.</p>  <p><em>Kotaku</em>‘s Zack Zwiezen is currently playing the <em>Marathon</em> beta as well and tested the game’s no–”Arc Raiders” filter a bit further. You can type “arc.” You can type “raiders.” You can type “arcraiders.” You can even type “arc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;raiders.” But you can cannot type “Arc Raiders.” Weird!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093</link>
            <guid>1447720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the past 10 years, </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> has risen from indie darling to the most popular farming sim ever made. It’s also apparently been a huge labor of love for its creator, Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, who keeps returning to release new major updates after claiming he’s done. Now, on the game’s 10th anniversary, Barone is looking both to the future and the past with two big reveals: additions to its romanceable cast, and some pretty neat looks back at its development history.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, in a video commemorating </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>10th anniversary, Barone revealed two marriage candidates heading to the game’s 1.7 update: Clint and Sandy. Clint is the town’s blacksmith, and he’s almost universally despised (and occasionally even panned as an incel). On the other hand, Sandy, who lives in the game’s desert area and runs the store there, is pretty cool and mysterious!</span></p>

  <p><span>Barone </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>revealed that the game would receive new marriage candidates earlier this month</span></a><span>. Players, of course, spent the whole month speculating who they could be—if they’d be new characters entirely, if the Wizard would finally become romanceable, or if there would be a divorce in town that rendered a married couple eligible. Quite a few people hoped it would be Sandy (although her addition seemed unlikely because she lives so far away), while mostly nobody wanted Clint.</span></p> <p><span>The video is also packed with some pretty charming peeks back at the game’s development timeline, especially from the game’s 2012 iteration called </span><i><span>Sprout Valley</span></i><span>. As far as I’m aware, this is the first time he’s shown off so much of that version. The layout of </span><i><span>Sprout Valley’s</span></i><span> world resembles that of the one we know today pretty closely, but the art is vastly different and (sorry) a lot less cohesive. Barone himself didn’t have too many kind words to say about the game’s earlier version either, calling the pixel art “crap” and speculating on what his life would have been like if he hadn’t put more time into development.</span></p>

 <p><span>“If I had just released this game after 6 months,” he said, “where would I be right now?”</span></p> <p><span>However, the footage he showed off later revealed that the game pretty quickly turned into the </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>we all know and love, with the build he showed off from just one year later looking almost identical to the game as it exists today. That’s just a really, really impressive turnaround for a developer to make. “</span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> hit puberty here,” he joked.</span></p>

 <p><span>Footage of the older builds also revealed a few massive features that were completely scrapped. He let on that the mines were initially procedurally generated and inspired by </span><i><span>Terraria</span></i><span>, and there was also an entire underground goblin village that was axed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was really neat to get a peek at this older gameplay, especially the axed features, the latter of which I’m sure will spawn plenty of theories about the game’s lore. I’m less happy about the marriage candidates, though. As someone who’s married to Emily in the game, I’m absolutely </span><i><span>repulsed </span></i><span>by Clint, who still flirts with Emily constantly despite my farmer literally having two children with her. Maybe it’s good that he can finally find a partner who’s not my freaking wife, I guess? Sandy, on the other hand, is fun! I can definitely see her newfound status as a marriage candidate sparking new challenge runs since players don’t meet her until much later in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of everything today, though, I’m most shocked by Barone’s pronunciation of Qi, the last name of an endgame character who provides the game’s most challenging quests. His last name is apparently pronounced “qwee,” which is possibly the worst thing I’ve learned all week. Thanks, Barone.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest entry into extraction shooters is here, as Marathon has broken onto the scene at long last. As fun as it is to loot and shoot your way through Tau Ceti, some direction is always nice, and for that, you’ll need to familiarise yourself with Factions. </p>



<p>There are six of them to work with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, but you’ll only have access to one of them out of the gates. If you’re looking to make some progress, you’ll want to unlock them all as soon as possible, as they each have unique offerings you’ll want to take advantage of.</p>







<p>Here’s how to unlock each of the six Factions in Marathon, as well as how to increase their Rank. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-factions-in-marathon">What Are Factions In Marathon?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of your contacts. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Factions are essential to your progression whilst playing Marathon, with each one offering you selections of gear to purchase and Contracts to complete in return for a variety of rewards. </strong></p>



<p>As you work your way through Marathon, you’ll quickly realise that Contracts are the biggest source of progression in the game, and there appear to be two varieties of them to complete, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Contracts: Repeatable missions you can complete for the given Faction, which vary in difficulty and rewards</li>



<li>Priority Contracts: One-time missions that are essential to the faction. These are tied to progression and help boost your Faction Rank, as well as offering significant story relevance</li>
</ul>



<p>You can only have one Contract active at a time, and you must select which one you’d like to work on before going out on your next run. That means no multitasking—you’ll have to think about the purpose of every run you go out on. </p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Each Faction offers a unique set of Contracts, but frustratingly, you won’t have access to them all out of the gate. You’ll need to unlock them all if you want to truly progress through Marathon, so here’s how you can get that done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-factions-in-marathon">How To Unlock Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will they unlock? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you want to unlock the other five Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete a special type of contract—the Liaison Contract.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll begin to unlock these pretty early into the game; you’ll just need to complete the tutorial and the Welcome To Tau Ceti Contract. </p>







<p>Once they’re finished, you’ll unlock Liaison Contracts. These are unique Contracts that get you in touch with a new Faction, with each one having its own Liaison to complete. You’ll only have to do these once, as a Faction is unlocked permanently upon Contract completion. </p>



<p>That being said, it’s one thing to unlock the Faction, but you’ll want to rank up with them, too. The higher their Rank, the more useful they’ll be to you, so that should be your next priority.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-factions-in-marathon">How To Rank Up Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What it’s all for. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To rank up Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete Contracts for each of the Factions, with different Contracts offering varying amounts of Rep.</strong></p>



<p>Rep is the currency used to rank up Factions, though it’s utilised automatically. It’s important to rank the Factions up, as the higher the rank they are, the better gear you’ll have access to. Also, at certain milestones, you’ll unlock various reward packages, as well as new Standard Contracts. </p>

</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though, as each Faction has its own selection of Upgrades for you to invest in. These vary drastically between Factions, with some offering improved Vault Space, whilst others offer various permanent Stat upgrades for your Runner. You’ll want to look into these thoroughly, as they’re crucial to building your Runner to suit your playstyle, and you’ll need to know which resources to keep an eye out for on your next run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">a ceremonious reveal at the conclusion of The Game Awards 2026</a>, newcomer developer Wildlight Entertainment launched its first-person raid shooter <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/highguard">Highguard</a> on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Despite eclipsing 100,000 concurrent Steam players around the game's launch, that number quickly dropped (though Steam concurrents are only a fraction of the total players), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/?curator_clanid=42108472&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23519058958&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAqD7is3VDEwxjBfZkCWgcxlH8k8JL&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-__MBhAKEiwASBmsBFUNtoczsPhjLNfWebvZlFh1bim0liiiC0GXfNpU7EGahTTQ39YkYhoCJ2YQAvD_BwE">with Steam's reviews status for the game sitting at "mixed" today</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/update-highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-confirms-layoffs-at-the-studio">Wildlight laid off most of its 100-person staff</a>, roughly two weeks after the game's launch, and according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, less than 20 developers remain at the studio – it's those remaining employees that have pushed out two somewhat hefty <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2027067859239907682?s=20">patches</a> for Highguard since the layoffs on February 11. That same <em>Bloomberg </em>report also details the game's development, the weeks after its reveal at The Game Awards in December, and the subsequent Highguard fallout since launch last month.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that in 2021, a small group of people who worked at developer Respawn Entertainment, owned by EA, quit and started a new studio. After helping Respawn launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> in 2019, some at the studio watched the battle royale bring in more than $3 billion in revenue over the next couple of years. However, some of the creatives felt slighted by how little of that $3 billion made its way to the developers behind it. Thus, the idea of starting a new studio, creating a successful surprise-launch live-service shooter, and sharing the profits among employees was born.&nbsp;</p><p>With Wildlight co-founder and CEO Dusty Welch touting the studio's profit-sharing program, he was able to attract others to join the team and work on what was first a survival game like Rust before it was transformed into the raid shooter that Highguard launched last month, according to the report. <em>Bloomberg </em>writes that after the transition to a raid shooter, which retained some of the elements of the original Rust-esque prototype, testing began with staff, external players, and Tencent's TiMi Studio Group; it was only recently revealed that China-based company Tencent helped fund Highguard by Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"><em>Game File</em></a> on February 17. &nbsp;</p><p>Reception amongst those tests was positive, according to the 10 Highguard developers <em>Bloomberg </em>spoke to for its report, but some employees were apparently concerned that these tests weren't accurate enough to a real play environment. Developers helped playtesters understand mechanics, in-game communication was encouraged, and more, but these gameplay aspects aren't guaranteed when a game reaches players' hands after launch. To get ahead of that, some employees suggested letting people play Highguard before launch, perhaps in a beta or open playtest, but leadership at Wildlight turned down that suggestion, <em>Bloomberg </em>reports.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The leadership at Wildlight wanted to announce the game and launch it a few weeks later, without letting the public play it beforehand, as those developers had seen work successfully with Respawn's Apex Legends. As a result, Highguard was revealed, the reception soured quickly, and the game became a bit of a meme online before it even launched, with some comparing it to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/concord">Concord,</a> PlayStation's own live-service shooter that shut down two weeks after launch.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that the employees it spoke to said Wildlight was a "healthy, collaborative, transparent" environment they loved working in... until the final two months, when morale tanked following the game's subsequent reception after The Game Awards reveal. Then, the game launched on January 26 and did little to impress both critics and players alike – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender"><em>Game Informer </em>gave it a 7.5 in its review</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite a strong initial showing, playercounts dropped, and two weeks after launch, Wildlight laid off most of its staff. With Highguard being a free-to-play title, its avenue for revenue is highly dependent on retaining players and getting them to spend money on in-game cosmetics, mounts, and more. Today, Highguard is still live and receiving updates, though it remains unclear how long it can live with so little staff, comparatively, working on the game.&nbsp;</p><p>For more details, be sure to read the full <em>Bloomberg </em>report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Have you played Highguard?

		<p>Liquid Swords has confirmed that its upcoming open world action game &nbsp;Samson: A Tyndalston Story is going to release very soon. In fact, it is only around six weeks away with Samson’s release date confirmed as April 8th. This is for PC only with the game coming to Steam and Epic Games Store, with console versions to come at a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrkHPvMOBwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/">previous FAQ</a>, we know that the main story will take around 10 hours to complete, but experiencing everything the game has to offer could take around 25 hours. It will be priced at $24.99 and will be a purely single player experience, so no multiplayer and no microtransactions either. This will be a grounded title so don’t expect too much wackiness, with players having to deal with the consequences of every action they take as Samson. In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt.Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progress, Samson will be able to hone his fighting and driving skills, both of which are crucial to surviving and carrying out the jobs that are offered to him. Samson will have to deal with the criminal underworld of Tyndalston as well as law enforcement, which will become more aggressive if Samson keeps on committing crimes in their presence. The PC minimum specs have also been confirmed for Samson and they are:</p>

<p>Coming in update 1.7</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> turns ten years old today and to celebrate, the game's creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone held <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-is-celebrating-10-years-with-a-special-anniversary-broadcast">a special broadcast on YouTube</a> looking back at the farming sim's development and update history.</p>
<p>But the big draw was the reveal of two new marriage candidates, who will be eligible for holy matrimony when the 1.7 update releases. And the fresh bachelor and bachelorette will be Clint and Sandy.</p>
<p>Clint is the local Blacksmith of Pelican Town who has a bit of a crush on Emily, who works at the Saloon. For most, he's best known for selling tools and breaking geodes.</p>
<p>Sandy, meanwhile, lives out in the Calico Desert. She runs the Oasis, a store that sells rare seeds and plants which <em>also</em> houses a mysterious room in the back. Not much is known about Sandy right now, so pursuing a romance with her will likely give her some much-needed backstory.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f0175034f617"><a title="Stardew Valley Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f0175034f617/stardew-valley-eric-concernedape-barone.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A">ConcernedApe</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole broadcast, which you can watch up-top, is well worth watching, as it's a lovely look back at the game ConcernedApe has spent <em>so</em> long working on. We see footage of Sprout Valley, which was the game's initial name, all the way through to around six months before its launch on Steam on 26th February 2016.</p>
<p>So, Sandy and Clint will be available to marry when 1.7 launches — when that is, we don't know yet. it will likely come to PC first before hitting Switch and Switch 2, as well, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>ConcernedApe remained hush on the release date and wants to keep many of the update's features a surprise. So don't expect much more news for a minute.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demon Tides Has The Speed And Splendor Of An Old PlayStation Platforming Classic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/demon-tides-steam-review-impressions-platformer-3d-2000674085</link>
            <guid>1447678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to platformers. I grew up on a healthy diet of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>, and pretty much every other mascot run-and-jump game you can name, so I’m real particular about whether a platformer’s movement feels good enough to hold my attention. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>, Fabraz’s sequel to 2021’s </span><i><span>Demon Turf</span></i><span>, feels like a mash-up of so many good platformers that, thanks to all those years I spent running and jumping, make it fit like a glove. The game’s impeccable movement design seems to draw on the best of what multiple games have done, fusing them all at once to make something that feels weighty, yet still fast and fluid enough that movement feels like a joy, not just a means to an end.</span></p> <p><span>I’m only a couple of hours into </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>on Steam (it showed up around the same time as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, I’m sorry!), but the early segments do a great job of introducing you to all the tools the game gives you to get around. Our spunky hero Beebz can transform into different animals at will, allowing her to seamlessly and effortlessly change how she moves through the environment. She can fly, float, grind, swim, and climb, among other things, and the transition between each of these modes of movement is quick, intuitive, and keeps the momentum going as long as your finger’s on the analog stick.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Over the past decade and a half or so, as some games have started to prioritize map size over many other things, traversal has become a common point of friction for me. If moving through a world isn’t quick and painless, I grow to resent giant worlds for wasting my time, thinking about how I would have once been able to accomplish much more in a smaller area rather than having to spend several minutes walking to the good stuff because someone decided that time spent getting somewhere is the pinnacle of game design. If I’m just walking along or riding a horse to get somewhere, my attention drifts pretty quickly, so if you’re going to have a big world, it had better be engaging to move through, and I’d better get where I need to go fast. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>’ open ocean would be daunting and annoying in most games, but transforming into Beebz’s snake form and slithering at incredible speeds makes getting to my next mission and obstacle course a breeze.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically enough, platformers are probably one of the genres best-suited for open-world game design because movement and flow is paramount to these games, even though we typically associate open worlds with grand RPGs or a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> metropolis. The promise of a large space is only delivered upon if it’s actually fun to explore, and </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>‘ collage of platforming staples accomplish that by hitting the sweet spot, making sure that your character feels like they have some weight and substance as you push the stick to move but never holding you down. </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>manages to capture the vibe of something retro while giving the modern explorer a big map to sink their teeth into.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I’m still early and have many hours to go, </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>scratches an itch I used to satisfy several times a year, but don’t get to as often nowadays. Though 3D platformers aren’t as en vogue as they once were, I still yearn for hopping and skipping through an obstacle course every now and then. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span> has all the makings of a game that would have become an early PlayStation classic, and I’m eager to see how much gas it has in the tank as I play on.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Viewer Count Hits New Low As Marathon Starts Running]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-viewer-count-drops-marathon-takes-off/</link>
            <guid>1447675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might have been inevitable, but as Marathon’s server slam has commenced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> has taken a gut punch in terms of viewership. At the time of writing, ARC Raiders boasted <strong>more players </strong>than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> (on Steam, at least), but viewership for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure had hit an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the viewer count was floating at around 22,000 as Marathon got started. That’s the lowest ARC Raiders has been in terms of active, engaged viewers since the game came out in October 2025.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders enjoyed a stunning time in the sun after launching at the end of October. It became regarded as one of the best games of 2025, and in our ARC Raiders review, we dubbed it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" id="155345">most refreshing extraction game</a> ever made.</p>



<p>But almost month after month, the game’s viewer count declines. In December, it dropped -33% compared to November, and in February (this month), -23% from January. Now that a fair chunk of the game’s player base has moved off to see what Marathon has to offer, it’s suffering further, sitting at around 22,500 at the time of writing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s a drop of around 94% since launch, from peak to current.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, Marathon, which comes out in just a week, has managed to trump ARC Raiders in a <strong>major </strong>way, despite only just entering its first open, public test. It has managed to secure a higher peak viewer count than ARC Raiders ever did, notching up a lofty height of 523,301 viewers, which was secured during Marathon’s gameplay reveal in April 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this is being written, Marathon boasts more than ten times the viewership of ARC Raiders, as everyone becomes curious to see what’s happening in Bungie’s new extraction game. The gap between the <strong>player count </strong>(on Steam) was just 30,000 players, too, in ARC Raiders’ favor.</p>



<p>Many believe that Marathon won’t hold a torch to ARC Raiders, which has proven to be overwhelmingly successful since being released in October. It might have some short-term success, but it’s becoming tough for new extraction-based games to <strong>really </strong>succeed in the increasingly saturated market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans around the world have been patiently waiting for Marathon to arrive, but before it does, Bungie has released the Server Slam Playtest. Although its main goal is to test the server’s stability ahead of Marathon’s full release, the Server Slam Playtest is a great introduction to the game, offering tons of early game content for fans to dive into.</p>







<p>However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be bumps in the road, and some fans have noted difficulties trying to jump into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> action. If you’re one of the struggling few who’ve run into the ‘Currant’ Error Code, here’s what it means and how to fix it.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest-servers-working-right-now">Are The Marathon Server Slam Playtest Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<p>As of February 26, the servers are up and running, as they’re working as intended for the majority of the player base, though it might take you some time to log in. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-runner-shell-in-marathon-all-abilities-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/every-runner-shell-in-marathon-all-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Marathon Runner Shell</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Launch day for any new online title is always bound to present some server instabilities, as the game finds it feet and copes with the sudden surge of players. However, that doesn’t make it any less frustrating if you’re finally ready to play the game, only for the servers to let you down. </p>



<p>Thankfully, it seems that for the most part, the Marathon Server Slam Playtest servers are operational, though some errors are popping up, namely the ‘Currant’ Error Code. If you’ve been unlucky enough to see it, here’s what it means.</p>







<h2 id="h-currant-error-code-in-marathon-server-slam-playtest-explained">‘Currant’ Error Code In Marathon Server Slam Playtest, Explained</h2>

<p><strong>If you’re trying to log in to the Marathon Server Slam Playtest and you’re seeing the ‘Currant’ Error Code, that means that there’s an issue with your network connection. </strong></p>



<p>As was the case going into the Server Slam Playtest, Bungie were aware that there’d be teething issues, and some have cropped up already. The ‘Currant’ Error Code appears to be the most commonly seen error, and it’s all to do with your network status. </p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon</a></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Bungie, the first step you should take is to ensure that your current connection is working as intended, so double-check your Wi-Fi and make sure it’s all up to speed. If you’re still seeing the issue, then you’ll want to run through some Network Troubleshooting. </p>



<p>Other users online have reported that a quick fix to the issue is the good old restart, but even that’s not guaranteed to solve the problem. It might just be a case of waiting it out and trying again soon, with the Server Slam expecting high amounts of players—this is likely affecting connectivity issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Stardew Valley turns 10 years old today, marking a huge milestone for one of the most beloved and successful indie games in of the modern era. Despite being far from a live service game, solo developer ConcernedApe (also known as Eric Barone) is still providing content updates to this day, and though they've slowed significantly in recent years, 1.7 is coming soon.</p><p>Today, Barone premiered a video on YouTube celebrating both the anniversary and upcoming update, taking a trip down memory lane to show off old builds of the farming sim while also providing a sneak peek at 1.7 – specifically, Stardew Valley's first new marriage candidates in years. At the very end of the video, he revealed that players will be able to romance Clint, the blacksmith, and Sandy, a shopkeeper in the desert.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geiTg6Z7w3A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geiTg6Z7w3A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Clint is a surprising choice, for a few reasons. For starters, Clint is commonly made fun of by members in the community who dislike his personality. In a cast of beloved characters, he stands out as one of the most commonly disdained. That said, maybe this is Barone's attempt to turn the character's popularity around, since romance quests give characters a lot more depth.</p><p>Still, there are other characters players have requested to romance for years. The most notable are Robin (she's married when the player arrives to the village, but that fact doesn't do much to quell romantic fans) and the Wizard. Unless they're coming in some massive 1.8 update, fans will have to stick to fanfic and mods.</p><p>The rest of the video is worth watching as well, since we don't usually get such a detailed behind-the-scenes look at indie games like this, and it's cool to watch the project come together.</p><p>Stardew Valley's 1.7 update doesn't have release window yet, but will hopefully be out sometime soon. If you haven't played Stardew Valley in a while, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/26/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-out-now-with-mouse-controls-local-split-screen">you can check out its Switch 2 update, which includes split-screen co-op and mouse controls</a>. As for ConcernedApe's next game, Haunted Chocolatier, we have no idea when to expect its release, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">but it's one of our most anticipated games right now</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/26/you-can-marry-clint-and-sandy-in-the-17-update-for-stardew-valley-concernedape-announces]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's pretty safe to say that the video game industry has been in a weird place for several years now, but for <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, who has been at this for a long time, the state of the video game industry is in an unprecedentedly poor place. Founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> and creator of <strong>Just Cause</strong>, Sundberg is getting ready to release his <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/">next major game</a> with his new studio he founded in 2020, <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, which'll release <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> this coming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ahead of Sundberg and Liquid Swords showing off their new title and announcing its release date during today's IGN Fan Fest, I got the chance to attend a presentation about Samson along with a few other members of the press, before spending some time playing the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/">You can check out my impressions on all of that here.</a></p>



<p>Afterwards, I also got the chance to ask Sundberg and Liquid Swords' senior game designer and mission designer for Samson, <strong>Donald Young</strong>, a bunch of questions about the upcoming game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">Within that interview</a>, I also asked a more pointed question about the realities of the modern video game industry, and how Liquid Swords is set up for the long term. That's when Sundberg laid into his thoughts on the current market and how he sees things.</p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been making games for over three decades and&nbsp;<strong>never experienced such a desperate, cowardly (they call it 'risk averse') and confused state of the business</strong></em>," Sundberg said. "<em>After the acquisition / over-investing party during ‘21-’23, we are dealing with the hangover and it’s been going on for three years.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Samson: A Tyndalston Story - Official Release Date Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Kj0VgwD-Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Sundberg continued by explaining how he has personally invested in the foundation of Liquid Swords, so not only does he have his personal finances at stake, but he also understands the more important factor is the future of the studio and its ability to keep a team of developers together.</p>



<p>He also cites <strong>NetEase</strong>, which invested in Liquid Swords in 2021, as a partner that has significantly helped Liquid Swords get to the point it's at now, where it is inching closer to releasing its debut game. But the studio isn't taking anything for granted, and is doing what it can to keep the lights on, which Sundberg admitted also included laying off <strong>half</strong> of the team at Liquid Swords to make sure they could get Samson out the door.</p>



<p>"<em>We have very careful cash-flow planning as we are on a limited budget. Last year, we made the tough decision to lay off (I don't call it 'restructuring' or any other BS term for what it actually is) <strong>half the team,</strong> to buy us a longer runway into 2026. We made a bet, and we do everything we can to deliver a fun $25 experience to lay the foundation for the future. I hope our future players will see the potential in our work and follow us on our journey to make something bigger</em>."</p>



<p>We can't know when the industry will get over the "<em>hangover</em>" it's been dealing with, which has resulted in countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">studio shutdowns and thousands of developers losing their jobs</a> over the last few years, but Sundberg is right on the money with how the industry is incredibly 'risk-averse' right now. One of the key takeaways from <a href="https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/">Matthew Ball's State of Video Gaming 2026 report was how private investment in the industry continues to decline.</a></p>



<p>Even though we're still getting some great games to play, the best gaming experiences always come from creators trying something new, and that means taking risks. Creatives understand how important it is to take risks. Hopefully, the bean counters of the industry will start to understand that more as well.</p>

			<p><strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>, the debut project from <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, the team founded by <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> (that's the <strong>Just Cause</strong> and <strong>Mad Max</strong> people, not the <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> studio <strong>Avalanche Software</strong>) founder, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PC first on <strong>April 8, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After being founded in 2020, the studio is now only weeks away from releasing its debut title, six years later. The game stars Samson McCray, a classic tough guy and driver who returns to his home town of Tyndalston with a heavy debt to pay on his shoulders. He'll have to take jobs each day to try and pay off that debt, while also trying to reluctantly make Tyndalston home again, not just for his own survival, but for his sister, who put everything on the line to make sure he got to keep breathing.</p>



<p>The game kicks off with Samson returning to the city after a job in St. Louis goes south, and as you'll see in the gameplay trailer below, he'll have to work off his debt by breaking plenty of skulls for anyone who'll pay him.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've spent a large part of my career building massive games,</em>" said Sundberg in a press release. "<em>With Samson, we knew that bigger doesn't always equal better and had to be extremely deliberate in what we built. Samson is the result of our team's work, tirelessly fine-tuning what our players expect, and more importantly, what makes games fun."</em></p>



<p><em>"<strong>It's not bloated, it's all about focus, and we keep players at the center of every decision</strong>. Fans of gritty 90's action flicks have something to look forward to when Samson releases on April 8th. Buckle up, because <strong>you're in for a ride</strong></em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samson: A Tyndalston Story Interview – Former Mad Max and Just Cause Devs Sink Into New AA Brawler That’s “Not GTA”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in 2020, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong>, revealed what he would be doing with the next chapter of his career after selling Avalanche with the announcement of <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>. Six years later, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">studio is weeks away</a> from its debut game, <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>.</p>



<p>It's not too dissimilar to the kinds of games that Sundberg's Avalanche was known for. Like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/">Just Cause</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-studio-founder-opens-up-on-2015s-mad-max-development-blames-warner-bros-for-canceled-dlc-and-more/">Mad Max</a></strong>, they both star a certain flavour of tough guy. The latter was also cited in a preview presentation I attended last week, with the emphasis on car combat in Samson connecting it to Mad Max.</p>



<p>What separates Samson as a new evolution in the kinds of action games we saw from Avalanche Studios while Sundberg was at its helm is how much more zoomed in it is. The team is adamant about what they are trying to deliver; they don't want to confuse anyone about what Samson is and what it isn't.</p>



<p>When I attended a press event last week, Sundberg even called this out at the top of his presentation. Beginning with a disclaimer, which he reiterated in his answers to me below, Sundberg was clear that Samson is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/">"<em><strong>not GTA</strong>."</em></a> I get why he's hammering it home, because while no game wants to try and set that comparison up in the first place, you definitely don't want to try putting your flag in the sand and compare yourself to <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> when the next entry in that series is (hopefully) just <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/"><strong>months away</strong>.</a></p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/">my thoughts on Samson and the presentation here.</a> Below, you can read my interview with Sundberg and <strong>Donald Young</strong>, senior game designer at Liquid Swords and mission designer on Samson: A Tyndalston Story.</p>



<p>Sundberg explains a little more about what he means when he says Samson is "<em>not GTA</em>," while Young shares a bit more about how the city of Tyndalston evolves across the game, and how its system of action points is designed to have players thinking about how they spend each day in the city, with every choice they make - and don't make - impacting your standing in South End.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After playing through a few different kinds of missions and story missions, I'm curious as to how missions evolve deeper into the game. Are there ever missions where we're driving (or piloting?) something other than a car?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Donald Young</strong><em>: Samson is a driver; a racer, getaway driver, and car brawler. He does not have his pilot’s license quite yet, there are only cars in the game. Samson has a unique car, we call the Magnum Opus, that is important to Samson, and we hope will be to players as well. The player has to maintain the Magnum Opus throughout the game, repairing it after car combat and refuelling the nitrous at the various gas stations around the city. </em></p>



<p><em>The Magnum Opus also has a few unique mechanics that will help Samson in his escapades. There’s a Kickdown action where the player can lower the current gear of the car, giving you more pull and higher rpm, which is useful in side-ramming other cars and while drifting. You can also kill the engine, which is useful when hiding from the cops. Samson can also store a weapon in the trunk of the car, useful when you’re paying someone a visit.</em></p>



<p><strong>How many kinds of missions (Beatdowns, Getaways, Deliveries, etc) are there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DY:</strong><em> There are eight Job types in the game, four on-foot and four vehicles, in addition to a few unique mechanics/scenarios you’ll see in the Chapters. And we’ve tried to ensure that within a mission type there’s variety in each experience. For example, with Beatdowns, there are over 30 combat arenas we’ve built throughout the city, some that allow vehicle use, that all have various environmental hazards and impromptu melee weapons the player can use in fun and chaotic ways. </em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_02-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>The Story Deck system, which is our system for spawning small story events in the city, is also active in most Jobs. So, for example, you may be tailing a target through an alley and come across a civilian being harassed. Do you stop and help this person, potentially losing your target as well as the cash and time from failing the Job, or do you look the other way so that you can make sure you make your daily debt payment? </em></p>



<p><em>These are the kinds of choices and actions we want the player to encounter when playing the missions.</em></p>



<p><strong>You said that Samson is a game about 'Intensity Over Scale,' what are some of the ways you think the game delivers on that promise?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DY</strong><em>: The game is about pressure, about making the best of what you can minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and day-to-day. The minute-to-minute pressure comes from combat. Brawls are intense and chaotic, and failure means losing time and money. Hour-to-hour the player has to balance between Jobs that have higher rewards but a higher risk of walking away with nothing. </em></p>



<p><em>And day-to-day the player has to deal with ups and downs of the debt cycle, and how they’re trending. If things are going poorly, debt collectors will start showing up, as well as other harsher consequences. Samson has to juggle a lot of problems, and that’s just life in Tyndalston.</em></p>



<p><strong>Beyond a lack of modern tech and fashion, what are some of the key ways Samson is situated in the 90s? How many 90s-era easter eggs will people who remember the decade be able to spot?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_04-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>DY</strong>: <em>My favorite 90s reference, sort of, in the game is actually about a floppy disk you have to steal. Samson and Carter are both adamant that computers will never catch on, and I just find it funny that even though computers were already a thing at that time, Samson and Carter are so old-school that they’re behind even in their own time.</em></p>



<p><em>For us, the goal was less about creating a time capsule into the 90s for the people to explore and more about asking ourselves what was Tyndalston like in the 90s. So, for example, there’s a pharmacy that you go into fairly early in the game. And the pharmacy feels like stepping into the past, from the products to the signage, except that everything has a layer of grime on it. </em></p>



<p><em>That Tyndalston grime, sticks to your shoe, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It’s also the second time that week that particular pharmacy has been robbed. And the whole city has this feel to it. So you’ll see cars from the 90s, but in the South End, you’ll also see cars from the 80s and the 70s, because not everyone can afford a new car. It’s a place in time</em>.</p>



<p><strong>How much of the city of Tyndalston do we get to see? Are there ways the city/our view of the city evolves as we get deeper into the story?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DY:</strong><em> Your view of the city should absolutely change over time. As you progress through the game, and explore the different city blocks, the hope is that you start to build an understanding of how South End operates. What problems the citizens are facing, what forces are responsible for those problems, and what role/power Samson has in those. And also how Samson is <strong>just another resident himself. </strong></em></p>

<p><em>Our hope is that players learn street names, which alleys are good for losing the cops, or choose to spend their time hanging out at many of the bars in the game. For me, South End is a joy to explore, and I hope players will get as much fun out of exploring the city as we had building it</em>.</p>



<p><strong>You made it clear that players shouldn't be comparing Samson to GTA, and during the presentation, when I asked which games you'd rather players look to for examples of what Samson will be like, Mad Max, Hardspace Shipbreaker, and Batman Arkham Asylum were all mentioned for different reasons. What's one element about Samson that you feel is totally unique to it, even among its similarities to other games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Christofer Sundberg:</strong> <em>I don’t want to stop anyone from comparing Samson to any game, including GTA. With that said, <strong>Samson is not GTA and it’s not AAA</strong>. It’s a focused mid-budget game built for intensity over scale, priced accordingly. One distinguishing feature that sticks out is the game loop around the debt, which is not the main story. It’s a loop that is constantly hanging over your head. </em></p>



<p><em>I find it really stressful in a fun way and anyone</em> <em>who’s been stalked by debt collectors (I was when I put my first studio Rock Solid Studios (the irony of that name…) out of business back in 2002) knows that feeling. Once you realize that there’s no way around it, you have to plan your game sessions accordingly so you balance the money-earning missions against the story missions. </em></p>



<p><em>So all in all, the pressure is unique for a game like this, and you can really feel it. Then we’ve picked pieces from the games mentioned and added our own flavor to them.</em></p>

<p><strong>Samson is Liquid Sword's debut game, but its subheading, 'A Tyndalston Story,' and some of the comments made during the presentation made me curious: is this the beginning of an anthology series of Tyndalston stories? Will Samson always be the main character, or is this first game also trying to establish a foundation for a grander story with multiple key characters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Building a world / city to be filled with interesting and mysterious characters has been our goal from the very beginning. We’ve taken a lot of inspiration from Taylor Sheridan's worldbuilding in <strong>Yellowstone</strong>, 1883, and 1923, and the way he’s created characters that live on for generations, each telling their own story, and one can really see why characters in Yellowstone are as they are and act the way they do. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Tyndalston will be our Gotham City and Montana</strong>. Future stories will shift perspective, but remain in Tyndalston. In Samson we experience Tyndalston in the South End district, where Samson grew up (in a small city block called The Ditch). We’ve written a <strong>400-year history</strong> of the city waiting to be told in games and other media</em>.</p>



<p><strong>With an increasing amount of video games being adapted into films and TV shows, is that an avenue you would like to explore with Samson in the future, and if you could pick one director to work on the project, who would it be?</strong></p>

<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Considering my previous answer, my choice of director would be <strong>Taylor Sheridan.</strong> We are in discussions with some 'media giants' about taking Tyndalston to linear media, but as we all know, Hollywood moves very slowly, so we’ll see what happens. </em></p>



<p><em>Moving the IP beyond games has been my vision since I started Liquid Swords, without jumping on the 'cross-media' trend that everyone says they are doing, but then they don’t. As a studio with these ambitions, you have to actively pursue every option in that area. The IP won’t fly into the movie theatres by itself, though, and we don’t have that experience or network internally. </em></p>



<p><em>We are working with <strong>Story Kitchen</strong> who are behind the Sonic Movies and are working with high-profile game IPs such as <strong>Tomb Raider, Just Cause</strong>, and <strong>The House of the Dead</strong>, to name a few</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of the studio's future, with the current state of the industry and how many studios we've seen in the time since Liquid Swords was established get shuttered after their first game, what steps has Liquid Swords taken to ensure it is set up for the long-term, even if Samson doesn't meet its commercial expectations?</strong></p>



<p><strong>CS</strong><em>: I’ve been making games for over three decades and <strong>never experienced such a desperate, cowardly (they call it “risk averse”) and confused state of the business.</strong> After the acquisition / over-investing party during ‘21-’23, we are dealing with the hangover and it’s been going on for three years. </em></p>



<p><em>As I started Liquid Swords in 2020, I made a big private investment in the company so for me it’s not only my personal finances that are at stake, it is also the future of Liquid Swords and our mission (which to me is more important than the money). In 2021, <strong>NetEase</strong> invested in a minority stake in the studio, and I am eternally grateful for their trust. I wouldn’t be doing this unless I strongly believed in our mission and, most importantly my team. </em></p>

<p><em>With that said, we have very careful cash-flow planning as we are on a limited budget. Last year, we made the tough decision to lay off (I don’t call it ‘restructuring’ or any other BS term for what it actually is) half the team, to buy us a longer runway into 2026. We made a bet, and we do everything we can to deliver a fun $25 experience to lay the foundation for the future. I hope our future players will see the potential in our work and follow us on our journey to make something bigger</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Generative AI is undoubtedly the hottest and most controversial topic in the video game industry. Does Liquid Swords use GenAI in its development processes? Do you have any policies dictating how it should or shouldn't be used, and whether you use it or not, do you believe GenAI tech has a place in game development now or in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We only have one policy here at Liquid Swords; <strong>No policies</strong>. We are not using GenAI as we develop Samson. We have used text-to-speech for temp-voice overs, but that’s it and none of those temp voice-overs will end up in the final game. I have tried to experiment with AI and so far I haven’t seen any successful tool that we can apply to our way of making games, so I wait and see. </em></p>

<p><em>Right now, going full on AI can become <strong>a legal nightmare</strong>. I also love to work with people, not robots, so that is a reason in itself to avoid fiddling around with experimental AI tech. Once there is a good reason, except for saving money and replacing super-creative developers with robots, to use GenAI we can look closer at it, but that’s a question for the future once GenAI matures. <strong>Liquid Swords focus is 100% of making Samson, with the team we have, not robots.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Do you have a message about Samson you'd like to share with players?</strong></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>We are really excited to bring Samson to you, and trust us, we are doing everything we can to make this experience as powerful and enjoyable as possible within the time and financial constraints we have. It is a challenge in today’s business climate, but it is fun, and we hope that shows in the game.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
