<p>New gameplay is more than Peppy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Chuhai Labs has shared the first gameplay trailer of its stunning-looking on-rails shooter, <strong>Wild Blue Skies</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Wild Blue</strong>), featuring some anthropomorphic animals piloting flying vehicles through the skies to fight evil. Sound a little familiar?</p>
<p>Okay, so the game still isn't confirmed for Switch (or Switch 2) yet — just PC and Xbox — but just watch the gameplay up top. Trust us. This is <em>basically</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a> with lovely cel-shaded-inspired visuals and all the barrel rolls, shooting and banter you'll ever need.</p>
<p>Here's a run-down if you need a <em>little</em> more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features Ready for Takeoff:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Modern Take on 90s On-Rails Shooters:</strong> Experience the thrill of classic aerial combat reimagined with modern design, smooth controls, and updated visuals.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>From an Aerial Legend:</strong> Developed by Chuhai Labs, the indie studio founded by Giles Goddard, the legendary programmer behind <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Stunt Race FX</em>, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and <em>1080° Snowboarding</em>.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>High-Flying Adventures:</strong> Take control of Bowie Stray and soar through vast environments from scorching deserts to frozen tundras and beyond.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Cinematic On-Rails Combat:</strong> Engage in thrilling dogfights and take down waves of enemies as you navigate intense, cinematic levels.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Environments:</strong> Each mission offers unique hazards and landscapes that challenge your reflexes and reward skillful flying.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Stylish Visuals &amp; Smooth Performance:</strong> A polished, modern aesthetic that channels the spirit of classic 3D shooters with crisp effects and fluid motion.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Streamlined Systems:</strong> Slick controls and intuitive gameplay make it easy to jump in while offering depth for veterans of the genre.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Rewarding Progression:</strong> Rack up high scores, complete optional tasks, and discover hidden collectibles as you battle against Grimclaw’s forces.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And look, if you need more convincing, one of the programmers of the original Star Fox — Giles Goddard — is working on this game' he's also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/stunt_race_fx">Stunt Race FX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080° Snowboarding</a>. of course, his most important work is in helping bring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> to GameCube.</p>
<p>Oh, and this is the same studio that worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cursed_to_golf">Cursed to Golf</a>. Basically, Wild Blue Skies looks absolutely lovely, and we would really like to see this on Switch.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get some news on other platforms soon!</p>

What was perhaps even more surprising was the reveal of Rosalina's Storybook, a hardback edition of the in-game page-turner that would be arriving in book stores a few months after the game.</p>
<p>Well, the day of release is finally upon us! Rosalina's Storybook is now available from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOorjBh-pADv0QYnniN05v02d6vsG-TfDFVi9uokLBXpP6ZTRWJ8e">My Nintendo Store</a> for $24.99 (or your regional equivalent), or from a bunch of other storefronts, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rosalinas-Storybook-Nintendo/dp/1506754902/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3GT8eJ_Pq9l9H4bUowCmpP16_qC-bT9pYu4wza_QqzoxwyQ0C7siKCKdrk2RyL2M409SBi0Ot_XpZuCfgtC3_7URhBjBtcV4rRQCXCh_olm8TVOfno18L3Azm_s0R0gStkNb6uXGdq2p0lHJPmQQWoO97Gu5wHwwKygEqna50Sw7xI9FHzMHEvyunDYHH0WGozV_8Xo9oCnmcfp7FwuR8ePcqnKcUVmLsB2B5bV503c.tfK6Je2N0XPqluVRHGK2bSnu9Y-TsyLjIQXo6eXZDgM&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;qid=1764086601&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANintendo&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3&amp;text=Nintendo" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/rosalinas-storybook/nintendo/9781506754901">Waterstones</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytws0BZJ-l_eg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890ikhuxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Much as you might expect, the book contains all the pages from the <em>original</em> game, retelling the story of a young girl and her relationship to the Lumas. Weirdly, it does not contain the new pages which were added for the Switch re-release, which feels like a bit of an oversight.</p>
<p>Either way, here's the book's official description from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.<br>
Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present <em>Rosalina’s Storybook</em> —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that the book, or some variation of it, will cameo in the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, with <strong>Captain Marvel</strong>'s Brie Larson taking on the all-important role of reading it as Rosalina. Larson joins <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> director Benny Safdie (Bowser Jr.) as the movie's new voice cast, whom we'll get to hear in full next April.</p>
<p>But the big question is, will you be picking up a copy of this galactic text for yourself? Sure, it might be a story we've all heard before, but it sure would look nice on a shelf. You can let us know if you've already nabbed yours in the following poll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Spellcasters Chronicles is the latest debut multiplayer game from a studio that is known for its single-player games, with Quantic Dream stepping up to try its hand in the genre. Ahead of the game's first closed beta, which will take place from December 4-7, I got the chance to play the game and ask game director Gregorie Diaconu a few questions about the coming title.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/spellcasters-chronicles-hands-on-preview-quantic-dream/">check out my hands-on preview with the game here</a> if you want to see how I got on with the time I had checking it out. In short, I'm not exactly convinced that Quantic Dream will be the first single-player-turned-multiplayer-studio that'll make both sides work. But there's still plenty of time for Quantic Dream to prove me wrong.</p>



<p>And, considering Diaconu's answers, the studio is ready to prove itself to me and to every other player currently looking at Spellcasters Chronicles with a doubtful eye.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Spellcasters Chronicles - Official Fire Elementalist Beta Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47UB8IVATOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>What was the driving force behind making a multiplayer game? What drew Quantic Dream towards this kind of project?</strong></p>



<p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles was born very organically inside the studio. Right after wrapping Detroit: Become Human, a small team started experimenting with a prototype that mixed action, strategy, and summoning, starting for the universal fantasy of being a powerful sorcerer who can summon armies of creatures of all shapes and sizes, and the simple joy of being able to fly without any limitation. It was fresh, energetic, and unlike anything we had done before, yet it still carried the things that define us: strong identity, systemic depth, and a desire to let players express themselves. </em></p>



<p><em>The prototype quickly caught everyone’s attention at the studio. What started as a side experiment became a fully-fledged production, and we built a dedicated team around it in 2020. In a way, Spellcasters Chronicles is a very natural extension of nearly three decades of Quantic Dream exploring new forms of interactivity. Since Omikron, we’ve constantly reinvented our grammar, whether through narrative branching, animation or technology through our custom engines and tools. We’ve never repeated ourselves, and we’ve always created original IPs. Adding multiplayer, competitive tension, and social interactions was simply the next step of that evolution.</em></p>



<p><em>And of course, as with all our projects, it’s an original IP conceived by David Cage, whose long-time desire to explore multiplayer gameplay and a high-fantasy universe naturally shaped the creative direction of the project. Spellcasters Chronicles allowed us to finally dive into those themes in a bold, stylized setting.</em></p>



<p><strong>Was it always going to be a free-to-play game? How did the studio fall on that choice, and is it a point of concern with how difficult it is for any game, F2P or not, to garner player attention?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes, from very early on, we felt that Spellcasters Chronicles needed to be free-to-play. The genre thrives on accessibility: we want players to be able to jump in without barriers, to try different Spellcasters, to experiment with strategies, and to enjoy the competitive ecosystem from day one. But being free-to-play doesn’t mean compromising our values. We’re dedicated to having fair monetization and, above all, to avoiding any pay-to-win elements.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re fully aware of how tough the multiplayer landscape is today, whether you’re free-to-play or premium. But we believe in this project because it comes from our studio’s own DNA. It’s bold, it’s different, and we think players will appreciate that. We also feel the market still rewards originality and sincerity, even in crowded genres. Our job now is to prove ourselves, one update at a time</em>.</p>



<p><strong>What will be the cadence of updates? Are new Spellcasters going to be added</strong> <strong>with each major update? How often will new maps be released?</strong></p>



<p><em>We’re not ready to share a full roadmap yet. But I can say that players can expect a very active update cycle. Major updates and seasonal drops will introduce new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, and even new Titans.</em></p>



<p><em>The goal is to keep the game feeling fresh and reactive to our community. We want players to always have something new to explore, master, and influence!</em></p>



<p><strong>What does it mean for Spellcasters Chronicles to have a "<em>community-driven narrative</em>"?</strong></p>



<p><em>This is one of the aspects we’re most excited about, and one we’ll reveal more about after the early beta phases. Right now, our priority is to let players focus on the core gameplay experience, because we’re not known for multiplayer games and we have a lot to prove. We want the gameplay foundations to speak for themselves first.</em></p>



<p><em>But at a high level: community-driven narrative is about giving players collective influence over the evolution of the universe. Each season, the community will face meaningful choices that can impact the lore, the world, and even gameplay elements. It’s a way of extending something that has always defined Quantic Dream: empowering players to shape stories. Except for this time, instead of individual branching paths, it becomes something shared, a story built by a community.</em></p>



<p><em>This closed beta is just the beginning. As we expand into the macro loop over the coming months, we’ll unveil how players can steer the fate of the world.</em></p>



<p><strong>How long does Quantic Dream expect to support Spellcasters Chronicles?</strong></p>



<p><em>Our intention is to support Spellcasters Chronicles for the long term. This isn’t a short experiment for us, it’s a major new IP and a project we’ve been building passionately for years. We’ve designed the systems, the narrative framework, and the seasonal structure with longevity in mind. Ultimately, the game’s lifespan will also be shaped by the community, and our commitment is simple: as long as players are there and engaged, we will continue to grow the world, expand the roster, and make the experience evolve.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will the game's first year look like?</strong></p>



<p><em>Again, the full roadmap will come later, but the first year is built around seasonal beats. Players can expect new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, Titans, seasonal events, and narrative updates tied to the community’s collective choices. The goal is to make Year One feel full of surprises, setting the tone for everything that will follow.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Might Be Headed For Its Own Embracer Moment]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-ea-funds-jared-kushner-trump-2000647246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/saudi-arabia-might-be-headed-for-its-own-embracer-moment.1364383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is Saudi Arabia’s takeover of EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">another big-brain play</a> or a sign of desperation? Can a more generous <em>Black Ops 7</em> battle pass convince players to keep playing? What does James Cameron&nbsp;<em>really</em> think about Netflix? It’s another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>As we skid into the long holiday weekend, I’m trying to decide exactly how many <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday</a> discounted game controllers I should buy to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. Or maybe I should just stop paying my electricity bill and force them all to take up knitting instead.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia is having an Embracer moment</h2> <p>The country’s Public Investment Fund has made a bunch of bad bets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). It reports that the sovereign wealth fund is running low on cash for new investments. You might remember one of them being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ig.ft.com/saudi-neom-line/">concept for a futuristic city</a> in the desert in the shape of one long line.</p>

 <p>This makes the fund’s massive bid to take EA private seem somewhat more desperate and precarious, given that much of it will be debt-financed at high interest rates. Embracer itself <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-saudi-arabia-dead-island-2-borderlands-deal-1850475619">once looked to the PIF to save it</a>, rapidly unraveling once a multi-billion dollar deal failed to materialize. It never recovered. We’ll see how long Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can continue flooding the zone with oil money to whitewash the country’s human rights record.</p>

 <p>Notably, the EA Saudi deal was reportedly facilitated by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. MBS recently visited the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl">in exchange for</a> fighter jets, advanced AI chips, and god knows what else. Trump brushed off MBS’s alleged role in having a Washington Post journalist murdered a few years back as “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-asked-about-khashoggi-murder-trump-says-things-happen-and-mbs-knew-nothing-about-it">things happen</a>” and claimed his family has done “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5613866/fact-checking-trumps-claim-his-family-has-done-little-business-with-saudi-arabia">little</a>” business with the Kingdom. I guess the largest leveraged buyout of an American firm by a foreign entity is just table stakes these days.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Black Ops 7</em> battle pass will be more generous than the <em>Black Ops 6</em> one</h2> <p>You’ll still have to battle FOMO, but unlocks will come more easily. “The team has taken learnings from <i>Black Ops 6</i>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey,” the devs <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Battle-Pass">wrote in a new blog post</a>. “The result: each season’s Battle Pass in <i>Black Ops 7</i> will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.”</p>

 <p>Initial pages will be shorter, and players can earn Battle Pass Tokens from Daily Challenges including in the co-op campaign, in case you’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">glutton for punishment</a>.</p> <h2>Palmer Luckey’s N64 clone is getting revealed soon</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ModRetro M64 hardware is getting a full reveal on Black Friday – features, colors, our incredible new controller, cutting-edge <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMD</a> hardware, etc.</p> <p>Much has changed since we launched early bird pricing at $199 earlier this year, things like inflation, component shortages,… <a href="https://t.co/T8MLilyweh">pic.twitter.com/T8MLilyweh</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ModRetro M64 is the arms dealer’s latest side project: an FPGA machine that plays old N64 cartridges on modern displays. Despite things like “inflation, component shortages, tariffs, and more,” the price will remain $200, which is 20 percent less than the recently launched Analogue 3D. The devil will be in the details, however. Luckey says all will be revealed on Black Friday, though a holiday 2025 release seems like a long-shot at this point.</p>

 <h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> gets a free update this week</h2> <p>The November 27 patch will <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">add more</a> weapons, enemies, and other small features, like some fresh team-up attacks for the musou fighter’s characters.</p> <h2>Helldivers 2 is getting jungle armor and giant chainsaws</h2> <p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos Warbond</a> will go live for players on December 2. In addition to the new Contra-style kits, players will get the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool which looks like a long buzz-saw that will slice through enemies and trees alike.</p> <h2>Big Jim hates Netflix</h2> <p>The <em>Avatar 3</em> director and box office giant James Cameron had some harsh words for the streamer’s Oscar strategy <a href="https://t.co/U5tk94vdNU">in a recent interview</a>. “We’ll put the movie out for a week, we’ll put it out for 10 days; we’ll qualify for Academy Awards consideration,” he said, critiquing the company’s free-loading strategy. “See, I think that’s fundamentally rotten at the core. The Academy Awards, to me, mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”</p> <p>Basically, he’s accusing Netflix of trying to draft off of the prestige of awards nominations without actually investing in theaters, all while its platform is directly undercutting the broader movie-going experience. Personally, I think Cameron could do a lot more to help theaters by releasing good movies instead of more <em>Avatar </em>sequels, but his underlying logic is unimpeachable.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967">People are training for ICE raids inside <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-multiplayer-metagross-xerneas-garchomp-2000646988"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> online battles are already super boring</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/dan-houser-ai-rockstar-gtav-rdr2-absurd-ventures-2000646935">Dan Houser is not buying all of the AI hype</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again. Early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are rolling in hot, which means you don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of top-rated items across all categories (TVs, laptops, smartphones, kitchen appliances, games) have already dropped to their lowest prices ever. Finding the right discounts that are worth your hard-earned money, however, can be a little overwhelming during such times, but that’s where we come in to help. Our shopping team is keeping an eye on the best deals around, so you don’t have to!</p>
<p>Those looking for a reliable storage solution — we have good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">Seagate just dropped its massive 4TB external hard drive by 20%, which means you can bring it home for just $100 today.</a> The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase, too. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. The deal, however, wraps up soon. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for it, but we’re not expecting it to last more than a couple of days. If you have been wanting to expand the storage of your computer or gaming console without spending a ton, now is the time to act. Grab it before the price shoots back up to $125.</p>

<h2>Stores All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>Running out of storage is never fun, and this drive is sure to take care of that issue for years to come. The storage capacity it offers is truly massive. 4TB storage means you will have space to house all your old and new data, which can include thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, years of backup, tons of research papers, an unusual number of work documents, plus all your favorite titles. And even after all of this, you will still have plenty of space left for future downloads. If you have ever been in a situation where you had to delete some of your old files to make room for new ones (like all of us), you’re going to greatly appreciate the peace of mind this brings.</p>
<p>It’s designed to work with Windows or Mac computers and select gaming consoles, with the setup being fairly straightforward. If you’re planning to use it with a Windows-based computer, you just need to plug in the power and then plug in the included USB cable. The drive should now appear in the (My) Computer/This PC and Windows Explorer/File Explorer. Using it with a Mac requires you to reformat the drive. Once that’s done, the system will detect the drive, and you can start using it.</p>



<p>This drive, despite the massive capacity it packs, is quite minimal and lightweight. It easily slides into a laptop bag without bulking things up, which makes it easier to take with you on the go when working remotely. You also don’t have to worry about losing your important data, as your purchase will include a year-long access to Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services. The service connects you to a team of world-class data recovery experts, offers one in-lab data recovery attempt, and gets you an encrypted storage device containing your recovered data if recovery is successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">In short, if you’ve been after a reliable storage solution for your important files, the Seagate 4TB external hard drive is a great option to consider, especially now that it’s available for just $100.</a> It not only offers a massive capacity, but is compatible with a range of devices and is easy to use, as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s next Premium Warbond, Python Commandos, drops on December 2, 2025; introducing a minigun, new weapons, stratagems, and more. </p>



<p>Premium Warbonds is the paid battle pass system in Helldivers 2, which provides players with exclusive content, including cosmetics, weapons, and more. A few months ago, we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST</a> Legendary Warbond, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils</a> followed it next. Now, the next Premium Warbond has been announced, adding a highly requested weapon to the game: a minigun. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond Weapons and Stratagems </h2>



<p>Revealed through the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Helldivers 2 is getting one new weapon and three new stratagems thanks to the Python Commandos Premium Warbond. First up is the M-1000 Maxigun, a new minigun that has an ultra-high ammo capacity. Next up is the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, which is a drone equipped with a flamethrower. It follows the player and coats their enemies with the fires of freedom. </p>



<p>Next up is another stratagem: the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, essentially a chainsaw that can cut through trees and enemies. Last, we have the AR/GL-21 One-Two, which is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher. It is a heavy weapon, but it deals heavy damage too, and basically puts two weapons in your primary slot. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-armors-and-capes">New Armors and Capes</h2>



<p>Let’s look at Helldivers 2: Python Commandos’ armors and capes; there are two new items in each category. The first armour is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set, “the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers.” Next is RS-40 Best of Prey: “a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.” Both armours come equipped with Rock Solid passive, which makes the player more resistant to staggering and ragdolling attacks. </p>



<p>There are two new capes and coordinating player cards: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.</p>



<h2 id="h-emotes-and-patterns">Emotes and Patterns</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond will add the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote, allowing players to “drop and give ‘em 20 anytime.” A new Chameleon Camo Pattern will also be included for FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-talk-about-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about their next game</a>. Additionally, the Arrowhead Games Studio CEO recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the Switch 2 port</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Valve changed its rules to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-is-no-longer-allowing-adult-games-in-early-access/1100-6534685/" data-ref-id="1100-6534685">prevent adult games from having early-access releases</a> on Steam. That came in the aftermath of a broader push against adult titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io</a>, largely at the behest of banks and payment processors. The upcoming indie horror game Horses is rated M for Mature, but it's not an adult title. Regardless, Steam informed the developer, Santa Ragione, that Horses was banned from the platform in 2023. The developer claims Valve has never explained its reasons for the ban in the two years since the ruling.</p><p>Horses is a first-person title that casts players as a ranch hand who spends two weeks at an increasingly bizarre and unsettling farm. The horses in this game aren't horses at all. They're naked humans wearing horse masks who are forced to act like beasts of burden.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkQSQnF_0Z8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkQSQnF_0Z8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Santa Ragione insists that Horses is not pornographic, and the publisher jokingly added that it apologizes if it "got your hopes up for horse porn." Instead, Santa Ragione says it's using "challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content."</p><p>According to the publisher, Valve never offered any guidance about what it found objectionable or what could have been changed to avoid a ban. Santa Ragione did share its belief that the ban may have been triggered by a scene in the game that originally featured a young girl riding on the shoulders of a naked adult woman in a horse mask. However, the publisher added that the scene in question has since replaced the girl with "a twenty-something woman" because the dialogue and the dynamic of that sequence was better served by using an older character.</p><p>Without a Steam release, Santa Ragione admits that the studio may be at risk of shutting down. To recoup at least some of the $100,000 spent on development, Horses will get a PC release on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a> on December 4. It will be priced at $5.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Marvel Snap will pay homage to classic comic team-ups with its next limited-time mode, Team Clash. The mode will reimagine dozens of existing cards as "Team Clash" versions with team-based synergies, and each team will have a passive ability to boost their strengths. The event will begin in late December.</p><p dir="ltr">The six teams run the gamut of Marvel characters and classic team-ups: Avengers, X-Men, Brotherhood of Mutants, Thunderbolts, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Spider-Verse. You'll be able to try out a pre-built deck with any of the six teams, or build your own custom Team Clash deck to try your own strategies. Your custom decks just need to have the six core cards for that team.</p><p dir="ltr">Some cards have been subtly tweaked for the Team Clash mode, while others are completely different. For example, in the Avengers team, each time you play an Avenger, you give the others at that location +1 power. Team Clash Captain America has an ongoing ability similar to his regular one: Other Avengers at his location get +2 power.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/">Splitgate 2</a> is finally getting out of its long beta phase. The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed that the beta will end on December 4</a>, when the servers will shut down so they can prepare everything for the full launch later that month. When this happens, the Beta Season, all active battle passes, and everyone's seasonal ranks will come to an end.</p><p>"Since launching the beta in May, this game has majorly transformed," the team said about how much the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/our-final-beta-playtest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game has changed</a>. "We started with factions and abilities, and we've rebuilt the entire foundation about what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gameplay."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob8fNw6a8O0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Splitgate's world is basically a futuristic sport where combat arenas are set up for high-tech portal battles. Players are dropped into zones with weapons scattered around, and the whole point is to outplay people using smart portal tricks, quick movement, and good aim. The gameplay feels like a mix of classic arena shooters and mind-bending portal tactics, where you can surprise enemies from almost any angle.</p><p>Splitgate 2 returned to beta because its rushed June 6 launch exposed major problems that the game simply wasn't ready to handle. There was also the colossal issue of aggressive monetization--highlighted by an $80 bundle quickly cut in half--and an apology in which the studio head blamed a former monetization lead, which only made matters worse. Since the studio had publicly criticized its competition before release, these flaws were judged even more harshly. 1047 Games acknowledged that Splitgate 2 needed far more work and pushed it back into beta to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/" data-ref-id="1100-6533350">fix its systems and rebuild trust</a>.</p><p>The team also said that going back to beta gave it the chance to rebuild the game from the ground up. Factions are gone, abilities are now power-ups, and classic modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch are back. With the beta, the developers also added new maps and weapons, reworked the menus, and refined numerous systems based on player feedback.</p>

It also stated that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has not been altered at the request of other platform holders. "The version releasing soon is the game as we intended," confirmed the studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-ceo-clashes-with-reporters-when-pressed-about-child-safety" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox CEO clashes with reporters when pressed about child safety</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkQSQnF_0Z8?si=3S3tGyEUqElwGeAc" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Santa Ragione says the ban feels like a "policy decision" as opposed to a legal one and emphasized that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't depict any characters that could be mistaken for children or minors. The studio feels Valve—which it said "informally expressed concern" about some of the game's live action intermissions before the automated Steam review had concluded—may have flagged the title because of an unfinished scene in an early build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We think the ban may have been triggered during the initial Steam submission by an incomplete scene on day six, in which a man and his young daughter visit the farm. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the 'horses' are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one," said the studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag. We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, that remains speculation on the studio's part, because Valve has purportedly failed to explain precisely which elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it deemed inappropriate. That, for Santa Ragione, is the core of the issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment," added the studio. "That might be acceptable in a truly competitive market, but Steam is a de facto monopoly, and arbitrary, unpredictable decisions can jeopardize the survival of developers and studios. We also believe they chose this particularly loaded and generic accusation because it is difficult to contest publicly."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We were treated without the professional respect the situation required&quot;">"We were treated without the professional respect the situation required"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Santa Ragione invested around $100,000 into the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, roughly half of which was donated by friends of the studio. It now feels that, without access to Steam, recouping that investment will be impossible—leaving it facing the very real risk of closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how the situation has impacted the team, Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva told Game Developer the past two years have been "profoundly disheartening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team and I have been extremely frustrated, knowing not only that we did our best to revert this decision, but also that we offered to comply with any request or regulation, and still we were treated without the professional respect the situation required," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is scary, humiliating, and patronizing to be told 'no, just because' by entities that hold absolute power over your financial stability. I think I personally feel what we described in the press release when we say this kind of approach pushes creators toward self censorship. Not having clear boundaries about what I am allowed to create and publish is depressing, and the opposite of an environment that enables and encourages creativity."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva added that he feels "tricked and betrayed" by Valve, which he said has received a substantial portion of Santa Ragione's earnings over the 14 years it has been conducting business on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I mistakenly thought that had bought us a certain level of professional courtesy that would allow us to solve any kind of issue. That belief gave me a false sense of security, a sense that the publishing process was at least somewhat predictable. It is hard not to see malice when rules are kept purposely obscure while at the same time there is insistence that their curation is automatic and 'democratic' because humans are not allowed in the process," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I [also] feel very bad for the author, Andrea Lucco Borlera, because he is obviously the one with the deepest emotional connection to the work. I was very worried about him when I first had to break the news that the game would not release on Steam. Imagine being told that the work you have spent years of your life on is not going to be published, without a reason, and there is nothing you can do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva said the entire team has been under "immense stress" after repeatedly trying and failing to appeal the ban. He is also worried that openly criticising Valve could place the development team in the firing line.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think it is very important that we have this conversation, but I know this opens up the team to additional scrutiny and criticism, both in general for openly criticising Valve, and specifically because Steam’s allegations are so broad and severe. It is something that has literally kept me up at night on many occasions," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the end I think [the team is] relieved that we managed to complete and release the game. Had we canceled it when we got banned, it would have been much worse. Of course everyone is sad that this is very likely going to be our last game together as Santa Ragione, but it is at least a consolation that it's going to be such a strange and hopefully memorable title."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Valve for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been 18 months since developer Santa Ragione - the hugely acclaimed studio behind the likes of Saturnalia and Mediterranea Inferno - unveiled its unnerving first-person narrative horror Horses. And after a bit of a delay, it finally has a release date, and is launching via the Epic Games Store, Humble Store, GOG, and Itch.io on 2nd December. One storefront is conspicuously absent from that list, however, with Santa Ragione today confirming Horses has effectively been banned from Steam.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Horses, which is being developed in collaboration with director Andrea Lucco Borlera, unfolds across 14 days on a rural farm where players - working as a summer farmhand - must perform "increasingly surreal" tasks. "As the sun sets and the facade of tranquility crumbles," Santa Ragione teases, "you decide whether to keep to the safe path or venture into the farm's hidden depths." The ensuing three-hour adventure blends "interactive scenes, live-action intermissions, monochrome visuals, and silent-cinema title cards" into a tale about "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility." It's a game Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">called</a> "deeply unsettling" when he played it last year, in no small part thanks to its naked, human "horses".</p>

<p>But it turns out that even before Horses' announcement in June 2023, Santa Ragione was grappling with Valve behind-the-scenes.

The gist, however, is that while Horses has sailed through the review process on all other PC storefronts, it can't be sold on Steam - effectively denying it access to 75 percent of the PC gaming audience, as Santa Ragione puts it  - and leaving the acclaimed studio in a financially precarious position and it now faces closure.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">full, much longer interview</a> with Pietro - about Santa Ragione's struggles with Valve and his hopes for change at Valve - elsewhere on Eurogamer.

      <p>Elvis Merzlikins has worn plenty of goalie masks in his time with the National Hockey League. He's spent the entirety of his career with the Columbus Blue Jackets, which means he's run through all sorts of ideas using the team's blue and red color scheme. He’s even asked his four-year-old son Knox to choose. The first new mask for this season is Spider-Man—specifically, Spidey from the Disney Jr. show <em>Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends</em>. He debuted a second new mask, even more striking than the first, during warmups at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio earlier in November: Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p>A mixture of new school Sonic from the movies and imagery from the classic games, Merzlikins’ mask is colorful, bold, and immediately recognizable. Both Sonic and Knuckles feature heavily—matching the Blue Jackets' color scheme—and are powered up with lightning. Smaller versions of other characters are rendered in 16-bit pixels around the mask, including the Blue Jackets mascot Stinger. Artwork on the chin is a reimaging of the classic Sonic logo: "Elvis the Goalie," with his number, 90.</p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@jboairbrush/video/7573029017184488725" data-video-id="7573029017184488725" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@jboairbrush" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jboairbrush?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@jboairbrush</a> <p>HERE IT IS!!

"Sonic is so cute and Knox just fell in love with it. All summer he was running around the house in Sonic costumes, thinking he's super fast. Sonic and Knuckles are red and blue, Columbus colors, so it was perfect."</p><p>Merzlikins said his son "gave him shit" that Knuckles isn't featured more prominently on the mask.</p>

<p>He entrusted the mask to Jordon Bourgeault, an airbrush artist from Calgary who is known for his highly detailed, vivid artstyle. Bourgeault started painting goalie masks as a hobbyist, decorating the gear of local beer league goalies or kids.&nbsp; But he broke into the NHL when Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price messaged him on Instagram around 2020 asking for a biomechanical skull mask. "It blew up," Bourgeault said. Now, he paints goalie masks for the likes of the Carolina Hurricanes' Frederik Andersen, the Canadiens' Samuel Montembeault, the New Jersey Devils' Jacob Markström, and, yes, Merzlikins.</p><p>Merzlikins said it was Bourgeault's idea to mix the movie with the 16-bit style of the classic video games. It was a huge challenge to render both styles in airbrush, Bourgeault said. (Merzlikins said he didn't play the classic Sonic video games. "I remember my brother playing it, but obviously he never let me play—I couldn't even touch the thing," he said.) The process of painting goalie masks in this way requires a ton of preplanning; Bourgeault begins by designing a mask on an iPad before making stencils that are used to mask off the mask. Painting happens in layers, then the stencils are pulled back, and more layers are painted. "It was a lot of stenciling and using a vinyl cutter to do all those little squares," Bourgeault said, noting that he had help from his assistant, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ink.x.air/?hl=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chris Moniz</u></a>. "For the little characters, like Robotnic and the little Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails on there, I did those with a brush because it was so small."</p><p>It took about a month, he said, and he usually charges around $7,500 for a painted mask.</p><p>"Looking at the details, how he painted it, I would lose my mind," Merzlikins said. "I would have thrown the helmet against the wall. I wouldn't have the patience—all the little squares. It's amazing. He has unbelievable talent in his work. It's my favorite. I've really fallen in love with it. Now when I get [a] puck in the head, I feel bad for it."</p><p>Beyond the tape jobs on skaters' sticks, goalies are unique in that they're allowed a variation in their uniforms with their goalie masks. It's long been a way for goalies to express themselves on the ice—to both share a bit of themselves with fans and to hold important imagery close to themselves during a game. Merzlikins said the art he chooses for his goalie masks is very important to him: "I've always been into the art," he said. "Hockey masks are really important—I collect them. It's always been something personal. As a goalie, I always wear it, and on the backplate, I have all my family and people closest to me with me, so they're always there with me on the ice."</p><p>Featured prominently on the backplate of his mask, Merzlikins also has a tribute to his late teammates and friends Johnny Gaudreau, who was struck and killed in 2024 by a drunk driver while cycling, and Matiss Kivlenieks, who died in a fireworks accident in 2021. "I think it's a cool tribute to have them with me on the ice always," Merzlikins said.</p><p>Merzlikins also has the names of his two children, and a rendition of Bubbles from <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> for his wife. There's the Latvian flag, too.</p><p>In past years, Merzlikins donned a mask with a <em>Minecraft</em> version of Elvis Presley, but like Sonic, he doesn't play the game. But he described himself as a big gamer. "I bring PlayStation with me on the road," he said. "I had a suitcase where inside was a screen and a PlayStation." Now with two kids, one of whom is just over a year old, Merzlikins doesn't have as much time to play video games, but he said he likes to play both <em>Call of Duty</em> and the NHL games. (But he doesn't play as himself: "Not Columbus, because you want to have a different taste in the video game," he laughed.)</p><p>As a father, Merzlikins said he's been eager for his son to be old enough to play video games with him. Speaking from Detroit on a team roadtrip, Merzlikins said his wife had his son play <em>Mario Kart</em>—and he loved it. "When I get home, that's going to be the very first thing," he said. "I was always waiting for the moment where I can play video games with my son, and I hope that moment is now, because she said he loved <em>Mario Kart</em>."</p><p>That, and presenting his son with some gifts that the Sega team and Sonic actor Ben Schwartz reached out with. Someone from the official Sonic the Hedgehog Instagram account messaged Merzlikins, he said, and offered to send some gifts over. Schwartz, too, reached out after seeing the mask and said he's going to send a voice recording for Knox. He told his son about the gifts over a Facetime message: "He was like, 'Daddy, Sonic is watching you! Sonic is going to your hockey games. He's going to come to my house and I'll show him my room.'" Unfortunately, Merzlikins had to tell him Sonic was too busy doing Sonic the Hedgehog things—but that he'd still say hi.</p>

		<p>PIONER is going to be launching into Steam Early Access on December 16th, GFAGames has confirmed following the game’s open beta. Those who purchase the PIONER Deluxe Edition will get three weapon skins, a creepy keychain accessory, a Founder title, the Renegade outfit, and the Katana watch accessory. Those who took part in the open beta will also get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When the PIONER open beta ended, GFAGames did state that there would be a further stress test to address the issues and bugs that players experienced. In a statement at the time, the team said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort.&nbsp;<wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release.&nbsp;<wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand.</p>

		<p>StarRupture will be having a co-op playtest running from December 3rd to December 8th, Creepy Jar has announced. The co-op playtest will run continuously through these dates so players can try out what is on offer as much as they want. There is also no NDA so everything can be shared, and joining the StarRupture playtest is as simple as heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture Steam page</a> and clicking the request access button.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture Co-op Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDfmyjbHKWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Creepy Jar has stated that the those who choose to play the StarRupture playtest will give acces to an early part of the game, the single player tutorial, and a free play option which will give limited access to StarRupture’s map. Bugs have been addressed since the July single player playtest, and performance has also been improved. Creepy Jar also wants players to not worry about spoilers as plenty of content is being held back for its Early Access release.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

<p>StarRupture will launch on January 6th, 2026 into Steam Early Access.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25-2000647217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25.1364320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 has become the phone that style enthusiasts actively desire and creates excitement in ways that standard flagship phones simply cannot match. The <strong>compact clamshell form factor</strong> when folded delivers visual impact that surpasses even iPhone’s polished design language, and transforms phones from utilitarian tools into fashion statements.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$899 for the 256GB model, down from $1,099</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$1,019 for the 512GB version, down from $1,219</a>, both configurations have hit record-low prices on Amazon for Black Friday that undercut traditional premium flagships. This seventh-generation foldable now costs less than many conventional flagship phones and delivers Samsung’s most refined folding experience yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual Display System</h2>
<p>The<strong> large 6.9-inch internal Dynamic AMOLED 2X display</strong> unfolds to reveal a proper smartphone screen running at 2520 x 1080 resolution with 120Hz adaptive refresh that shifts smoothly between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the content. This primary display boasts HDR10+ for vibrant colors, going up to a peak brightness of 2600 nits that ensures perfect readability even in direct sunlight when its competitors all wash out completely. The<strong> external 4.1-inch Super AMOLED cover screen</strong> is a significant evolution from earlier tiny external screens, offering real utility for notification checking, music control, taking selfies, and running widgets without opening the phone. This cover display <strong>boasts a 1048 x 948 resolution and a matching 120Hz refresh</strong> for smooth interactions that make quick tasks possible without the unfolding ritual that earlier Flips required for everything.</p>



<p>The<strong> Samsung Exynos 2500 processor is built on an advanced 3nm manufacturing process</strong> and brings flagship performance with 10 cores that include high-performance Cortex-X5 cores reaching 3.3GHz. In practice, this processing power takes on-demand games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without experiencing the thermal throttling or battery drain seen by earlier foldables that tried to pack flagship specs into severely constrained thermal envelopes.</p>
<p>This <strong>includes a dual-camera system with a 50MP main sensor featuring optical stabilization and 12MP ultra-wide</strong> captures for stunning photos that easily rival traditional flagship cameras, notwithstanding the engineering constraints of fitting quality optics into a folding form factor. Meanwhile, the f/1.8 aperture lets in substantial light for excellent performance in low light, while optical stabilization ensures sharp handheld shots even in challenging conditions. The ultra-wide lens captures expansive landscapes and group photos without the distortion that ruins cheaper implementations. <strong>Video recording tops out at 4K at 60fps</strong>, with enhanced stabilization for smooth footage when walking or shooting actively.</p>



<p>A <strong>4300mAh battery capacity represents an upgrade over past generations</strong> while an efficient 3nm processor and adaptive display refresh come together to deliver all-day battery life through typical usage patterns. The 25W wired charging replenishes the battery relatively fast, though it lags some competitors that offer 65W or faster. The 15W wireless charging offers cable-free convenience, and the reverse wireless charging lets you top up the Galaxy Buds or another Qi-compatible device just by placing it on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>For less than the traditional premium phone price, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 manages to deliver unique folding design, dual 120Hz displays, flagship Exynos 2500 performance, capable cameras and all-day battery life at this record Black Friday price on Amazon. Samsung’s seventh-generation refinement eliminates the compromises that made earlier foldables feel experimental rather than practical daily drivers.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally X Is Good, But Has Issues</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Other improvements as part of the Xbox-branded handheld update are faster loading for your games library and "improved gamepad response after login." In addition, Microsoft and Asus have teased future tweaks for the devices. They want to enhance "sleep and wake reliability" as well as add AI-powered automatic super resolution, for instance. Additionally, next week the plan is to introduce a game-save-sync indicator so you know when your progress is properly stored in the cloud to use on another system.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Asus stated that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-to-ramp-up-rog-xbox-ally-production-after-initial-sales-exceed-expectations/1100-6536270/">ramping up production on ROG Xbox Ally handhelds</a> after the devices exceeded expectations.

Further update notes are below:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Default Game Profiles (Preview)</h3><ul><li>If the game falls short of its target FPS, the game profile is designed to boost power to help reach the target FPS, trading a bit of battery life for a smoother gameplay experience.</li><li>If a game is performing above the target FPS, the game profile is designed to limit FPS at the target rate to save power.</li></ul><h3>Additional Improvements</h3><ul><li>Improved Gamepad response after login</li><li>Quicker Library loading, especially for players with large game libraries</li><li>Improved Cloud Gaming page performance, loading more quickly and more responsive</li><li>New Game Gallery filter by Performance Fit, helping you see how well games will run on your device</li><li>Bug fixes and performance enhancements for improved stability and responsiveness</li></ul>

<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160784/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>As a person who grew up on the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider</a> games back on the PS1, I eagerly anticipated the ‘new era’ of Lara Croft promised by publisher Square Enix and developer Crystal Dynamics for the 2013 reboot. Seemingly inspired by the success of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/uncharted_drakes_fortune">Uncharted</a> franchise (which itself was inspired by Tomb Raider), the first game in this reinvention strips back the years of character development and delivers a young woman yet to build the skills and charisma her older counterpart emits.</p>
<p>Instead, a young Lara is swept up in a dangerous adventure that lands her marooned on a remote island named Yamatai, and battling both hired goons and the wilderness itself for survival. It's a little dated now (prepare for lots of QTEs), but back in 2013, this gritty new take on Tomb Raider was a reinvigoration, and thanks to some smart combat changes shamelessly ripped from Nathan Drake’s outings, it still feels fresh today.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160786/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider</a> (2013) is a quasi-open-world entry that splits the gameplay between third-person action and platforming to explore. Lara and her team aboard the Endurance find themselves stranded, and quickly Croft is battling not just the elements, but also hoards of mercenaries (and plenty of other enemies) in a desperate struggle to survive and escape. Plus, you’ll also be doing some good-ol’ plundering, with small hidden Tombs littered across the map, not unlike the Shrines in modern Zelda.</p>
<p>The world of Yamatai is surprisingly open, and while the platforming here is nothing like the style of exploration we’d get just a few years later with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, the playground surrounding Lara is wide enough to feel intimidating.</p>
<p>Stripping the protagonist back to the essentials also makes her vulnerable, and the world surrounding Lara is absolutely out to take advantage of that. We find Croft beaten, bloodied, and generally put through absolute hell, and while it can occasionally feel gratuitous (seriously, those kill screens are wild), it does a fairly good job of showing the very first trials that forged our hero.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160787/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Mixing platforming with occasional stealth, sprinkling some light RPG elements with a skill tree, and some basic but satisfying combat, this Tomb Raider is a cocktail that tastes much better than the sum of its parts, largely thanks to execution. Revisiting it for the first time in many years, it's remarkable that while it certainly does ape the Uncharted formula (and perhaps even a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>), there’s a cohesion and thrill to the gameplay that makes it impossible to put down.</p>
<p>The third-person action still feels tight, and while your weapon selection isn’t huge, the ways you can improve them are plentiful. Earning XP from combat or scavenging weapon parts slowly unlocks more options, and alongside finding relics and other collectibles, there’s plenty to uncover and many reasons to do so. Even when inspecting some of your pilfered relics, spinning them around to find hidden secrets is a joy and even earns you more XP. Though on Switch, the rumble goes a bit wild when you are looking at these relics and are close to a new clue.</p>

<p>Ultimately, original developer Crystal Dynamics did a good job of helping you care about Lara’s progression and making it feel earned. Whether you’ve played it before or are hoping to finally experience this story, there are dozens of hours to enjoy here if you want to explore everything on this godforsaken island.</p>
<p>Aspyr is responsible for this particular port, bringing this Definitive Edition to our greedy little mitts quite out of the blue. But, while some of the other ‘Definitive Edition’ ports on recent hardware boast gorgeous visuals and lighting effects, instead, this feels like the very original 2013 release given a quick polish.</p>
<p>Everything runs great, but stopping to look at textures or some of the character models reveals that this is a version of the game that has omitted visual fidelity in favour of performance, to quite a dramatic degree. I loaded up my PC copy of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition just to play around and try to find a similar graphical benchmark, and cannot say I was impressed with the results. At a glance, Switch 2 feels comparable to the Normal PC graphics settings, and we’re definitely not getting the advanced TRESSFX for Lara’s hair.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160782/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, frame rate performs much better, with my tests showing a rock-solid 60fps on Switch 2 in docked mode while visuals were running at 2560x1440, with handheld mode looking to run at a comparable level frame-wise. Gameplay is key here, and this is not an ugly game by any means. A lush jungle is strengthened with dense foliage and inquisitive wildlife. Weather effects and running water add to the immersion and the great sound design. A lit torch and its flickering flames illuminate the dank caves and many tombs you must explore, smartly using shadows and beams of light to great effect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a vantage point reveals the large scope of this gorgeous island, as well as the many dangers within. Ideally, the world would also have a greater variety of visual identity, because there’s a lot of PS3-era grey/brown design here, with even an occasional smearing of dirt on the screen. Lara spends the game covered in filth and surrounded by the elements, and the visuals convey that well.</p>
<p>For those picking it up on Switch 2, there are a couple of nice additions to sweeten the deal. One of those promised by Aspyr is gyro controls, and they appear as an option, but seem to only move specific menus instead of your sights with guns or bows. This, if intentional, is a wild choice and a complete waste - we've reached out for clarification and will update if/when we hear back. Hopefully, actual motion controls will be implemented with an update in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160783/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Faring slightly better are the mouse controls, which at least work, but are very sensitive and a bit wonky. Even when holding the Joy-Con sideways, you have to use 'ZR' to pull your arrow, and then 'R' on the same Joy-Con to release it. This is just a very weird layout, and doesn't ever feel comfortable, especially when the controller version of this is the standard 'ZL' to pull, and 'ZR' to release.</p>
<p>Finally, this Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider also includes a treasure trove of additional content, including concept artwork, character models, and even the return of the surprisingly fun multiplayer. If you ever played the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/uncharted_3_drakes_deception">Uncharted 3</a> online mode, this might be the closest thing we have today.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is sadly not as Definitive as the title might imply. While Aspyr has done the work to make a title from 2013 run at a solid 60fps on a handheld, and with 1440p resolution, it seems the cost was graphical fidelity at almost every turn. Not to mention the bizarre implementation (or lack thereof) of motion controls, and unwieldy mouse options.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this entry in the Tomb Raider mythos remains one of the very best, and clever visual design means that your trip through Yamatai is far from ugly, as long as you don’t inspect too closely. Crystal Dynamics’ 2013 reinvention of Lara Croft just might be the best entry in this decades-old franchise, and for the asking price, you’re getting a thrilling action romp that’ll keep you hooked until the credits.</p></section>

		<p>Dead By Daylight has been given a brand new update by Behaviour Interactive, bringing the game up to update 9.3.0. The update re-enables the Mindbreaker perk, but has disabled the Breakdown and Wicked perks. Another new major change applies to the Hook with a Resolve Bar being made visible to other Survivors while being hooked. There are also more balance changes, plus changes for both Killers and Survivors. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>
<h2>Dead By Daylight 9.3.0 Mid-Chapter update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Mindbreaker perk has been re-enabled.<wbr></li>
<li>The Breakdown and Wicked perks have been disabled.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Quality of Life</b><wbr></p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>The Resolve Bar is now visible to other Survivors while hooked.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To help bridge the information gap between players using voice chat and those who aren’t, we’ve added the Resolve Bar to the HUD. This will help Survivors determine if the Killer is camping and plan their next move accordingly.</i></p>
<p><wbr><b>Balance</b><wbr><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Anti-Facecamp meter now fills faster based on how long the Killer stays near the hook:<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>0-10 seconds: 1x speed<wbr></li>
<li>10-20 seconds: 2x speed<wbr></li>
<li>&gt;20 seconds: 4x speed<wbr></li>
<li><i>Note: This multiplier only accumulates when the Killer is considered camping (the meter is gaining progress). The multiplier resets when the Survivor is unhooked.</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decreased the base fill rate of the Anti-Facecamp meter by roughly 50% to compensate.<wbr></li>
<li>Hooking a Survivor now applies a 7 second grace period to all hooked Survivors&nbsp;<i>(was only the last hooked Survivor)</i>.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: To make the Anti-Facecamp mechanic fairer to both sides, we’ve reduced the base fill rate and added the time the Killer remains near the hook as a modifier. This gives Killers who are not camping more freedom to pass by a hook (particularly in cramped spaces like hallways) without worrying about the meter filling and giving the Survivor a free escape. This also means that Survivors who are being camped for extended periods gain the ability to unhook themselves slightly earlier.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Unhook Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survivors gain 10% Haste and Endurance for 15 seconds after being unhooked&nbsp;<i>(was 10)</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Decreased the time for crows to appear to 80/100/120 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 120/140/190)</i>.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Following the release of the updated AFK crow system, we increased the time it took to gain crows. This was much too generous, allowing for Survivors to avoid crows too easily. We’re dialing back the values a little bit to a middle ground between the original values and the live values.</i></p>


<p><b>The Shape</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slaughtering Strike’s camera controls are now identical to regular camera controls.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Skull Merchant</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the Drone Rotation speed to 105 degrees/second&nbsp;<i>(was 95 degrees/second).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the Hindered status effect from getting scanned to 10%&nbsp;<i>(was 8%).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Deploy Drone cooldown to 7 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 10 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased the Undetectable duration after deploying a Drone to 6 seconds&nbsp;<i>(was 8 seconds).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the fast vault immunity to Scan Lines.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every 2.5 seconds spent standing underneath a Drone, the Survivor gains 1 Lock On&nbsp;<i>(was instant).</i><wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased Killer detection range for the Drone&nbsp;<i>(now only rises when colliding directly with The Skull Merchant)</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: The Skull Merchant has dropped fairly significantly in terms of kill rate and lethality. These buffs aim to make her Drones a bigger threat and bring her up a little bit. Additionally, we’ve decreased the cooldown to deploying drones, and consequently decreased the duration of Undetectable to keep some downtime between her Undetectable status effect. When standing underneath a Drone, Survivors would get instant Lock On, which felt like a bug whenever it happened. The gradual increase of Lock On will feel more natural and provide feedback to the Survivor that something bad is happening to them. Lastly, we reduced the Drone’s sensitivity to their mistress, to make sure they are always ready to scan Survivors during chases in tight spaces and don’t ascend unintentionally.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Original Pain (The Cenobite):</b><wbr></p>
<ul>

<li>Inflicts the Deep Wound status effect if the Survivor is injured&nbsp;<i>(removed).</i><wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: Both of these add-ons were notorious for their ability to disable the Endurance status effect Survivors get when they are unhooked. These changes aim to remove this ability to bypass the protection post-unhook.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: With the above changes to hook improvements, we thought it was the right time to raise a few Score Events to encourage Killers to spread first hooks earlier in the match.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<p><b>Pallet Density Changes</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed all pallet tiles to evaluate and reduce the safety of pallet loops on MacMillan Estate, Asylum, The Red Forest, Yamaoka Estate, Haddonfield and Mount Ormond Resort.<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the spawn logic of certain structures (i.e. the main building in Disturbed Ward; the piers in Backwater Swamp) to better randomize items and balance the distance between windows and pallets. This also impacts The Red Forest<wbr></li>
<li>Adjusted the Crotus Prenn Asylum Realm, reducing the safety of the main building which could spawn near maze tiles and chain into other tiles.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Dev note: After collecting feedback from the community on the recent pallet density update, we made the above changes to address some of the most notable friction points.

			<p>When Spellcasters Chronicles was announced, it felt like a whirlwind of an announcement. Early morning of Thursday, October 16, 2025, you could see rumors online about Quantic Dream making a multiplayer game. Shortly after, those rumors proved to be true as Quantic Dream co-founder David Cage <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">confirmed the studio was entering a new chapter with a multiplayer game in development</a>, while work on Star Wars Eclipse continued.</p>



<p>Fast-forward one hour from Cage's post, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/">Quantic Dream had announced its multiplayer title</a> as Spellcasters Chronicles, a new PvPvE, 3v3, F2P, third-person multiplayer action game that's also a hero-shooter and a deck builder. The game's first closed beta would arrive before the end of the year, and the next day, on October 17, attendees at TwitchCon would be able to play it and check it out for themselves. It was a lot, to say the least, for the announcement and reveal of the studio's debut multiplayer game.</p>



<p>Though, while it's arguably a tad overwhelming with its mix of genres, it also makes a lot of sense to me. As a studio known only for its single-player games, Quantic Dream might as well go big or go home with its foray into multiplayer. So that means we get a game that's trying to mash a few different things together: a bit of Overwatch here, with a bit of deck building there, and a splash of Destiny, but your characters can actually fly in the air constantly instead of having to come back down to the ground.</p>

<p>It also means a short eyes-to-hands time span, which is my term for the time between when we see a first trailer and when it's first publicly available to players to try. A shorter eyes-to-hands time span means less time for players to wonder how development on it is going, and less time for negative speculation.</p>



<p>There's some emphasis on narrative, though at this stage in the game, it's far less clear how that will play out. I've found that a lot of developers will try to claim there's some kind of meaningful narrative to be found in their multiplayer game, and very few, if any, will actually make good on that claim. We'll see where Spellcasters Chronicles ends up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, ahead of the game's first closed beta, I got the chance to play an hour of Spellcasters Chronicles with other members of the press and a few of the game's developers. Well, it wasn't necessarily an hour, because the first 15 minutes were spent solving a couple of technical issues, one of which was that the game ran like an absolute slideshow on my laptop.</p>

<p>My laptop is not the highest-end gaming laptop out there; I have a 3070Ti laptop GPU paired with a Ryzen 9 6900HS CPU and 32GB of RAM. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either, and while I get that it's a pre-release build, I was still surprised by how poorly it was running when I first loaded the game and got into a match. I was able to have a smooth experience for about 45 minutes once I connected to Quantic Dream's internal streaming setup, so my impressions are mostly based on that short window.</p>



<p>That short time frame could very well be why, coming away from that time with the game, to answer the question I asked in the title of this preview: No, it probably can't cast a spell on players.</p>



<p>Now, there are a lot of caveats here; I didn't spend a lot of time with the game, only getting through about one and a half matches. I also wasn't playing with a bunch of experienced Spellcasting Chroniclers (or whatever its community of players will call themselves). Each side had one Quantic Dream developer on their team, so the sides were evenly matched with one experienced player, but the rest of us were new to it, and anyone who plays multiplayer games knows that as your game knowledge increases, so does, generally speaking, how much fun you have.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I also didn't get the full Spellcasters Chronicles experience - not just because of the short time I had with it - but because the abilities my character had were pre-set for this demo. I have to imagine that if we were able to actually build the characters we played and spend some time choosing and learning the pros and cons of each card, which would be the case in the final game, I'd feel more engaged with the match.</p>



<p>All that to say, I could be wrong, and this could become the next big multiplayer game in the industry for all I know. But what I do know is that, whether I'm wrong or not, I probably won't be playing very much of it, and that has little to do with the limitations of the time I spent with the game; I only mention them because they do, of course, colour my experience with it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Let me start with the good. It feels good to play, and by that I mean it felt good to fly around, to use the different abilities of my hero, to summon creatures and move forward on your enemies' Lifestones. While I did have issues with the pacing in the one-and-a-half matches I played, I appreciate the layer of strategy involved in its gameplay and the back-and-forth that can occur. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/8.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's also not a boring game to look at. There's a great spectacle to the gameplay, with the spells you use as your main attacks, summoning creatures to march towards your enemies' Lifestones, and especially summoning Titans to march your line forward. A spectacle that was only matched by an experience I had, where I summoned a Titan-sized stone wall to defend our team's Lifestone long enough to destroy theirs, and win the match.</p>



<p>There's a lot to like about Spellcasters Chronicles, for sure, I'm just not sure it's all engaging enough to really make a dent in the communities of already established multiplayer games, particularly established MOBAs. Much of what I don't like about playing the game can be attributed to things I just don't like about MOBAs, but even when considering that my personal issues with MOBAs clearly aren't problems for the millions of people that play them, it's difficult to see Spellcasters Chronicles breaking through the ceiling.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Most of the moment-to-moment gameplay in Spellcasters Chronicles felt good, and very little of it felt great. Casting spells felt good because they looked cool, but they never felt great to cast, as the visuals, audio, and animations didn't align to make it a deeper sensory experience.</p>



<p>The character designs seemed fine? The more I study them in action while watching back gameplay footage from my play session (which isn't my actual gameplay but a developer playing due to technical issues with the capture of my footage), the less intrigued I am to know anything about them, but I don't think I would say they look bad. The environmental design of the map was lacking anything really eye-catching, and I'm not entirely sold on its mix of genres. It's not a 'bad game,' which means it must be a 'good game,' at least in some ways, but it's by no means a great game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/62.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles. Image credit: Quantic Dream</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>'Good but not great' is not a good place for a multiplayer game to land in 2025.</p>



<p>Launching a new original single-player game, and by that I mean a game that's not based on a previously established series, is one thing. Launching a new original free-to-play multiplayer game? You're not just trying to get players in the door, you're trying to get them to move into a mostly empty space when they're already living in five other world-class apartments (games).</p>



<p>Yes, this is just a preview. Yes, once again, I only had a short time with the game in limited, pre-release conditions that the general public won't deal with. Yes, it will be tweaked and altered over time, and yes, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/report-reveals-how-ubisoft-execs-turned-splinter-cell-game-into-xdefiant/">how many multiplayer games</a> we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/herman-hulst-playstation-trying-to-learn-from-live-service-failures-concord/">seen come and go</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/herman-hulst-playstation-trying-to-learn-from-live-service-failures-concord/">announced</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">unannounced</a>) even within <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazons-crucible-just-got-discontinued-only-five-months-after-launch/">just the last five years</a>, across <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mountaintop-studios-shutting-down-after-debut-shooter-spectre-divide-falls-short">all genres</a>, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">not exactly prophetic</a> to say <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">the latest game to try</a> won't make it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spellcasters Chronicles - Official Iron Sorcerer Beta Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkQTXOgMERY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But I'll still say it, because I don't think Quantic Dream has something here that's ready to smash onto the MOBA scene and the free-to-play multiplayer scene and catch everybody's attention with the kind of intensity that it needs to survive.</p>



<p>Ultimately, hey, what do I know? I know that I didn't love what I played, but I liked it enough to give it another shot under regular conditions to win me over. I know that it's not generally my kind of multiplayer game, and that's where I hit a wall with it. I also know that in the history of single-player game studios branching out to multiplayer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">it doesn't always go so well</a>.</p>



<p>If you want to play what honestly feels like it'll be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">FBC: Firebreak</a> of MOBAs, then you should check out the closed beta for Spellcasters Chronicles from December 4-7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458470/Spellcasters_Chronicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-rog-xbox-ally-update-adds-%E2%80%9Chand-crafted%E2%80%9D-game-profiles-for-40-games.1364269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-says-market-response-to-xbox-rog-ally-has-been-extremely-positive/">ASUS and Xbox released their collaborative handheld device</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally and its more powerful variant, the ROG Xbox Ally X. It was the arrival of Xbox's Full Screen Experience (Xbox FSE) and our first taste, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">according to Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, of what the company will do with its future consoles.</p>



<p>In the time since launch, ROG Xbox Ally users have seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rog-xbox-ally-biggest-update-since-launch-boosts-battery-life-and-game-performance/">plenty of updates come from ASUS</a> as it supports and fixes software issues with the device as they appear, but we've yet to have a new feature added or see a major update from Xbox - until today, as Microsoft announced in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/25/rog-xbox-ally-updates-improvements-november-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> that the latest update adds Default Game Profiles.</p>



<p>The new feature is meant to make your experience playing on the ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X as seamless as possible and limit the amount of time you'd have to spend in a game's settings, adjusting and tweaking the graphical options so you can get it running at a solid frame rate and visual fidelity.</p>



<p>Essentially, Xbox has, across 40 titles to start, created ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X-optimized settings. These Default Game Profiles will automatically balance frame rate and power consumption for supported titles creating "<em>smoother, more enjoyable gameplay and extended battery life, without requiring manual adjustments</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Inside ROG Xbox Ally - Default Game Profiles" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCU97vtmsE8?start=23&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong, for example, is a game that you can now get a full extra hour of playtime out of, due to how well the power consumption is optimized with its Default Game Profile, according to Xbox, while still playing at a full 120 FPS.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you're not locked into using a supported game's default profile; you can still choose to adjust the settings manually to your preference. They'll also only turn on automatically when you're playing the ROG Xbox Ally on its battery, and not when it's plugged in. "<em>When you launch a supported game, the system automatically applies a tailored game profile, which sets recommended power (TDP) and a FPS limit specific to the game</em>," the Xbox Wire post reads.</p>



<p>Though the post is clear that 40 titles are supported off the jump, it doesn't include a full list of the supported titles, only highlighting 16, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>



<li>DOOM Eternal</li>



<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages</li>



<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Forza Horizon 5</li>



<li>Gears 5</li>



<li>Gears of War: Reloaded</li>



<li>Gears Tactics</li>



<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Sea of Thieves</li>



<li>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</li>
</ul>



<p>Currently, games that are cleared to work well on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X will include a "<em>Handheld Optimized"</em> notice on that game's store page, though there doesn't appear to be a tag for games included in the list of games that support the new 'Default Game Profile' feature. The Outer Worlds 2, for example, is a game I booted up on my ROG Xbox Ally X that I could see does support the new Default Game Profile feature and is not listed here.</p>



<p>Perhaps a tag will be added later, but for now, if you want to check if a game you're playing supports this new feature, you'll only be able to find out once you've launched it, and can see the option for the Default Game Profile in the Armoury Crate Command Center.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ROG-Xbox-Ally-Default-Game-Profile-Update-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Xbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today's update also includes: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Improved&nbsp;Gamepad&nbsp;response&nbsp;after&nbsp;login&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>Quicker Library loading, especially for&nbsp;players with large&nbsp;game libraries&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>Improved&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;Gaming page&nbsp;performance,&nbsp;loading&nbsp;more quickly and more responsive&nbsp;</em></li>



<li><em>New Game Gallery filter&nbsp;by Performance Fit,&nbsp;helping you see&nbsp;how well games will run on your device</em></li>



<li><em>Bug fixes and performance enhancements for improved stability and responsiveness</em></li>
</ul>



<p>As for what's to come in the future for ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X users, next week we'll get a Game Save Sync Indicator, a much-needed feature that arguably should have been included at launch, but at least it's here now. "<em>With clear status updates, you’ll know exactly when your progress has synced to the cloud, whether you’re wrapping up on your PC or powering down your handheld. No more guessing or lost progress</em>."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-liquidates-ugreen-nexode-65w-4-port-fast-charger-almost-free-now-2000647211</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern life requires charging multiple devices at once and most homes and offices don’t have anywhere near enough outlets or good-quality chargers to keep phones, laptops, tablets, and accessories all charged up simultaneously. A compact multi-port charger consolidates the charging infrastructure into a single hub that eradicates adapter juggling and outlet competition and offers fast charging across all connected devices.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">$24, down from $39, Ugreen’s four-port Nexode 65W charger has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that suggests a zero-margin pricing that’s purely aimed at driving volume sales during the critical shopping period. This aggressive discount makes <strong>premium GaN charging technology accessible to everyone</strong> rather than remaining a luxury for tech enthusiasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Power for Laptops</h2>
<p>The maximum <strong>65W output provides enough power to charge MacBook Air</strong>, MacBook Pro, Dell and other USB-C laptops at full speed rather than the trickle charging that lower-wattage adapters deliver. A MacBook Air reaches 51% battery in just 30 minutes when using the full 65W through a compatible cable: this makes quick charging practical during brief work breaks or morning routines.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration, including three USB-C outputs and one USB-A input</strong>, covers every device type you’re likely to carry daily without requiring multiple chargers or adapters. You can charge your laptop off one USB-C port while simultaneously powering your phone off another USB-C port, your tablet off the third USB-C port, and older accessories such as wireless earbuds or fitness trackers off the USB-A port<strong>. Intelligent power distribution</strong> automatically adjusts wattage allocation based on the requirements of the devices connected to ensure optimal charging speeds, rather than equally splitting power without regard for actual needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact dimensions of just 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches</strong> make for a charger small enough to slip into jacket pockets or laptop bag compartments without the bulk that makes larger chargers a pain to transport. This size reduction compared to traditional laptop chargers comes courtesy of GaN technology that allows higher power density in smaller packages thanks to running cooler and more efficiently than silicon-based designs. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body to avoid snagging on bag contents or causing damage to other items during transport.</p>
<p>Besides size reduction,<strong> GaN technology provides safety due to better thermal management</strong> and prevents dangerous overheating that has plagued cheap chargers with outdated component designs. Improved efficiency means less energy is converted to waste heat during operation, keeping the charger cooler during extended use while reducing fire risk. Built-in protections against overcurrent that could damage sensitive device circuits, overvoltage spikes resulting from unstable power grids, and short circuits from cable damage or debris in the ports are included.</p>



<p>This covers universal compatibility with MacBook Pro and Air, iPhone 15/16/17 series, Samsung Galaxy S24/S25, Google Pixel 9/10, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and virtually any USB-C device compatible with Power Delivery fast charging standards. That cross-compatibility breaks the iOS versus Android divide in which you’d have to use different chargers for different ecosystems.</p>
<p>For $24, the Ugreen 65W charger delivers a total of four ports, including three USB-C, GaN technology, and 65W laptop charging capability. Now 39% off retail this Black Friday, Amazon’s aggressive pricing suggests margin sacrifice for volume during peak shopping season.</p>
