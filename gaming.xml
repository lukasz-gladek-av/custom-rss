<p>The in-development remake of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion appears to be coming sooner than originally expected. This according to a new claim from known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Nate The Hate said that he expects news on the remake to come either this month or in April.</p>



<p>“Release is likely to be sooner than the original June target,” he added. “But still working to get details on an updated release date.”</p>



<p>Previous rumors on the remake suggest that the game is in development at Virtuous Games and is being built in Unreal Engine 5. It’s also expected that the game will feature significant changes to the gameplay, including the blocking system. Earlier rumors suggest that the system will feature elements from the Dark Souls franchise. The games sneaking and stamina mechanics will also be updated for modern day.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown what platforms the remake will release on. </p>

<p>Bethesda has yet to officially announce or comment on the Oblivion remake. Until something becomes official or Insider Gaming can independently verify the information, please take the claim with a grain of salt.</p>

But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p><p>The studio expects to take <em>Spectre Divide</em> offline “within the next 30 days,” and it will refund all money since the game’s first season, which kicked off on February 25th. Mountaintop Studios will also be “closing its doors” at the end of the week, according to the post.</p><p>“We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition,” Mountaintop says. “In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.”</p><p>In December, Mountaintop CEO Nate Mitchell and <em>Spectre Divide</em> game director Lee Horn told <em>The Verge</em> that things were already dire, and that the game’s console launch and new season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24325918/can-spectre-divide-escape-concords-failed-shooter-fate-heres-the-hail-mary">would be its hail mary play</a>. Horn said that the marketing was working going into launch, but that server issues beginning on launch day axed its momentum. “Unfortunately, the game fell over on day one,” he admitted. </p><p>Mitchell told us the game needed thousands of concurrent players if it was going to survive, or else the company would run out of money this year. Unfortunately, the game’s new season peaked <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2641470#3m">at just over 1,000 concurrents on Steam</a>, and has been downhill ever since; presumably, Mountaintop saw its multiplatform peak of around 10,000 players drop similarly.</p><p>“If the players are enjoying the game... if they aren’t into season one, they way we hope they are, we’ll have to take a hard look at if we should keep going on as we are, or if players are telling us this isn’t what we want,” Mitchell told us in December. Apparently, Mountaintop did have to take that hard look, and this is its decision.</p><div><p>The <em>Spectre Divide</em> shutdown follows the disastrous launch of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">forgettable <em>Concord</em> hero shooter</a>. Sony has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closed down <em>Concord’s</em> development studio</a> and permanently shut down the game.</p></div><p><em>Additional reporting by Sean Hollister</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has some good news for Steam Deck owners looking to sink into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> later this month: after previously saying the game wouldn't be compatible with Valve's gaming handheld, it's now done a bit of a U-turn.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, as part of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">lengthy tech Q&amp;A</a>, Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows would "not be compatible with Steam Deck [at launch], due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." That, then, suggested it wasn't just a case of Shadows failing to tick some boxes to pass Valve's verification process, but rather that it simply wouldn't run well at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, with Assassin's Creed Shadows' release just weeks away, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j9og39/assassins_creed_shadows_we_are_happy_to_say_that/">shared an update for Steam Deck users</a> - confirming Valve's device will, in fact, be supported at launch. The publisher didn't explain what had led to the change, but presumably - hopefully - it's managed to eke out a few performance gains in the time since its original announcement.

<p>
Ubisoft adds it's still awaiting the results of Valve's verification process, so doesn't currently know which of Steam Deck's compatibility classifications Assassin's Creed Shadows will receive (Valve <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">grades games</a> as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, or Unknown on the device) . "More info to come soon," its message concludes.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (including Steam Deck!) on 20th March, and will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">receive a range of PS5 Pro enhancements</a>. And if you're looking for more granular release information, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">global launch times have also been revealed.</a> As for the game itself, it's "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far", as Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">wrote earlier this year</a>.

			<p>Two months ago, the long-running Oblivion remake rumors (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originated</a> from the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit 'leak' from two years back) intensified greatly following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed report</a> from MP1st.</p>
<p>That report mentioned Virtuos had been working on porting The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. Virtuos previously worked on Obsidian's The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition and is a co-development partner for Konami's Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>According to the report, the remake features improvements in six key areas (other than the visuals, which is a given): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and Heads Up Display.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has also been improved and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system has also been tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, the developers have reportedly improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing in third or first person view.</p>
<p>Now, leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that Bethesda could officially unveil this Oblivion remake in March or April at the latest, with a release that could come shortly afterward. The insider added that June was the original target, but the launch could happen even sooner. VideoGamesChronicle has subsequently not only backed Nate's rumor but also <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the remake could be released as early as next month.</p>
<p>Of course, the 2006 open world roleplaying game doesn't need a lot of marketing. Fans are already very excited to be getting not one but two renditions when you factor in Skyblivion, the fan-made recreation of Oblivion in Skyrim's engine, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Are you ready to return to the Imperial City?</p>

<p>The 3v3 tactical shooter Spectre Divide, the first game launched by Mountaintop Studios, will be taken offline within the next 30 days. Mountaintop Studios itself will close its doors at the end of this week.</p>



<h2 id="h-specter-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down">Specter Divide and Mountaintop Studios to Shut Down </h2>



<p>After its August 13th closed beta launch last year, Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios are shutting down just months later. In a letter from studio CEO Nate Mitchell, he <a href="https://x.com/SpectreDivide/status/1899943286158336111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the closure is attributed to a lack of “active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from our CEO about the future of Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios.</span></p></article></div>



<p>“Since the PC launch, we stretched our remaining capital as far as we could, but at this point, we’re out of funding to support the game,” Mitchell continued in his letter. “This means Mountaintop will be closing its doors at the end of the week.” Mitchell said that the team considered all options, including a new publisher, additional investment, and even a possible acquisition. In-game purchasing will be disabled and purchased made since the season one launch will be refunded.</p>



<p>During Spectre Divide’s first week, it attracted roughly 400,000 total players, and hit a concurrent player peak of over 30,000 in September. In contrast to traditional tactical shooters, Spectre Divide stood out with a Spectre clone that players could switch between. But the game fell off dramatically in just a matter of months, never cracking over 4,000 players since that peak. It saw a very small spike in returning players in February with a new season launch, but still fell short of desired player numbers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has released its mid-season update for Season 1.5, and while it's a small update, it still packs a fiery punch, focusing on tweaks to The Human Torch, Iron Man, and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p><p dir="ltr">"Following the balance adjustments in Season 1.5 and the addition of the Human Torch and The Thing, we've noticed a surge in the popularity of various heroes, leading to exciting new strategies in matches," the game's developers wrote in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post announcing the update</a>. "Whether it's a rush comp centered around mobile Vanguards and Duelists, a double-flyer setup featuring Storm and Human Torch, or the classic 3-1-2 lineup with three Vanguards, or even the previously popular 2-2-2 or single Vanguard compositions, each has showcased their unique flair in the current competitive environment."</p><p dir="ltr">"So, in this mid-season balance update for Season 1.5, we'll be optimizing the experience for just a handful of heroes to maintain this rich diversity," the post went on to explain. "As we gear up for Season 2, expect new Heroes and fresh Team-Up Abilities to bring an even more thrilling experience!"</p><p dir="ltr">So which heroes are getting tweaked this time around? First up is The Human Torch, who is getting buffs to his primary attack and his ultimate ability. His Fire Cluster projectiles now move 150 meters per second (up from 120), and 14 projectiles are fired (up from the previous 12). The energy cost of his Supernova ultimate ability has been upped from 3,400 to 4,000, but its activation wave damage has increased from 70 to 80, and his Flame Tornado now does 120 damage per second (up from 100).</p><p dir="ltr">Next up is Iron Man, who is getting some slight nerfs for balance. Direct hits from his Repulsor Blast (Stage 1 and Stage 2) now do 40 damage (down from 55), but his spell field damage has increased from 35 to 50. Direct hits from a Stage 3 Repulsor Blast now do 50 damage (down from 65), and spell field damage has been increased from 40 to 60.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Cloak &amp; Dagger are getting some attention in this update: The Duality Duo's Lightfore Dagger now heals 16 damage (up from 10) when hitting allies, but the spell field healing amount generated by the hit has decreased from 18 to 16.</p><p>For a closer look at the mid-season update, check out <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">the latest Marvel Rivals blog post</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda's long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake is reportedly due to be formally unveiled very soon, with signs pointing to a possible release before June.
</p>
<p>
Word of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake first surfaced in 2023, when a former employee of Chinese studio Virtuos posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works. And while references to an Oblivion <em>remaster</em> were later spotted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">leaked internal Microsoft document from 2020</a>, more talk of a remake emerged earlier this year - again from a former Virtuous employee.
</p>
<p>
But despite all this chatter, Bethesda's lips have remained firmly sealed. That might be about to change, however, according to multiple reports. NatetheHate - an insider with a strong track record of accurate Microsoft leaks - took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1899604247978840406">say they expect an official announcement</a> "either this month or next month."

<p>
Additionally, they offered a revised release window, having previously claimed the Oblivion remake would launch this June. "[It's] likely to be sooner than the original June target," they wrote, "but still working to get details on an updated release date." Lending further credence to NatetheHate's claims, VGC says it's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bethesdas-oblivion-unreal-engine-5-remake-could-be-releasing-sooner-than-you-think/">corroborated the report</a> with its own sources, adding it's heard the game may even release as early as next month.
</p>
<p>
As to what players can expect, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">most recent Virtuous leak</a> called it a"fully remade" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed in Unreal 5. It's also said to features various system overhauls, including reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD. And with Oblivion's birthday looming - it originally released on 20th March 2006 - now seem like a good moment for Bethesda to finally revel its hand.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sure enough, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s exciting Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT graphic card prices, quoted at $550/$600</a>, are looking too good to be true. Newegg, Overclockers UK, and even Micro Center are among the outlets that have now quietly raised the prices on the <em>supposedly</em> entry-level MSRP models of these graphics cards by $50-$130. Last Thursday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch">AMD wouldn’t deny reports</a> that its partners are explicitly allowed to rapidly increase those prices beyond MSRP, and a week later, that’s already coming to pass.</p><p>While it’s true that board partners like ASRock, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, and XFX generally charge more for cards with fancier cooling solutions, those aren’t the cards we’re talking about today. We’ve been tracking prices on ten specific models of the AMD 9070 and AMD 9070 XT that were originally introduced at their $550 and $600 MSRPs.</p><p>None of those cards are currently in stock at any retailer we’ve checked — but some retailers have already modified their pricetags ahead of new shipments. Here are the changes we’ve seen:</p><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070-xt"><h2>AMD Radeon 9070 XT</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Newegg now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper at $700, a $100 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists XFX’s 9070 XT Swift at at $730, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>Newegg now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at $670, a $70 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 XT Reaper and Sapphire Pulse 9070 XT at £650, an £80 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists ASRock’s 9070 XT Steel Legend at £669, a £99 jump</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="amd-radeon-9070"><h2><strong>AMD Radeon 9070</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Micro Center now lists XFX’s 9070 Swift OC at $630, an $80 jump</span></li><li><span>Micro Center now lists Gigabyte’s 9070 Gaming OC at $670, a $130 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists PowerColor’s 9070 Reaper at £570, a £40 jump</span></li><li><span>OCUK now lists Sapphire’s Pulse 9070 at £570, a £40 jump</span></li></ul></div><p>Not every retailer has changed out the pricetags on every card. Best Buy, which only listed a single model of the 9070 and 9070 XT at MSRP to begin with, hasn’t changed those prices yet — though they’re admittedly still out of stock. (It also now lists a pair of out-of-stock Gigabyte cards at MSRP.) Micro Center also still lists three models of 9070 and four models of 9070 XT at MSRP, though all are out of stock.</p><p>On the Nvidia front, there doesn’t seem to be much retailer/board partner scalping going on yet, at least at major US retailers. We’re tracking six different models of $550 RTX 5070, three different models of $750 RTX 5070 Ti, and three different models of $1,000 RTX 5080 which were originally listed at MSRP prices. Best Buy, Newegg, and Micro Center are still listing the ones they stock at MSRP today.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch#:~:text=It%20did%20address%20the%20larger%20question">AMD told us</a> that “we expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599,” and that more cards are coming. AMD did not say which board partners or retailers would agree to offer cards at those prices, or how few those partners would have to sell at those prices before charging more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
There's a lot of buzz around Inzoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton - partly because it's a promising new contender in a genre that's so far been dominated by a single series, and partly because it's a bit of a looker. And if you were wondering exactly what sort of PC you'll be needing in order to crank Inzoi up to the max, those details have now been revealed - alongside a video showing how the game'll look at different tiers.
</p>
<p>
Inzoi (or InZOI as Krafton would have it) is described as "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will". It promises to give players the tools to "alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences", alongside the likes of jobs and "deep relationships through interactions". It's also leaning hard on the customisation side of things, showcasing remarkably detailed characters and elaborate homes.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, its Unreal Engine 5 powered reality - which takes a far more photorealistic approach compared to something like The Sims - isn't going to run on any old potato. And Krafton has now revealed exactly what hardware players will need to have stuffed inside their gaming PCs if they want to play Inzoi at either Minimum, Medium, Recommended, or High settings without risking the chance of a weird small and/or small house fire.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/inzoi-pc-specs.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
In fact, Krafton's gone a little further than that, <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8303">providing eight different preset options</a> giving players an easy way to choose between better graphics or better performance across its four hardware tiers. Even more handily, all this is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzk45yOjkY">video demonstrating the impact these various setting will have on the game</a>. And while the differences are certainly evident, Inzoi still looks to put on a decent show on lower-end hardware.

<p>
Inzoi initially comes to PC as an early access release - it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">available on Steam from 28th March</a> - and Krafton says it'll "continue working on optimisations to improve performance while finding ways to lower system requirements without compromising overall quality."

But a recent discovery makes it technically possible to clear a hunt in just two seconds. Fans are having fun with the exploit despite it not actually saving them any time. Let me explain. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Players couldn’t understand how he pulled it off. It was later revealed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>VG247</em></a></span>, that the trick is less about actually capturing monsters quickly and more of an accounting sleight of hand that has to do with the way hunts are triggered in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p><p>While you can start fighting anything at any time, it’s not technically a hunt until the quest message flashes across the screen. That’s when the clock starts ticking for how long players have to finish the quest. And fans recently realized that you can poison monsters to your hearts’ content without ever actually triggering the clock.</p><p>So what players can do is keep pelting a Quematrice or Lala Barina with poison ammo until the beast gets weak. The monster will fight back, but no quest will have technically begun. Then, once it’s weak enough to catch (a little skull appears on the mini-map), players can capture it with the standard combo of shock traps and tranquilizer bombs. At that point the quest <em>will</em> begin, but less than two seconds later the monster will be captured, giving players lightning-quick clear times. </p><p>It’s important to emphasize that there’s no real use-case for this trick other than bragging rights and creating a fun meta-speedrunning challenge. Give players an in-game stopwatch and they will try to find ways to break it. I’m still waiting to see if players find some broken builds that truly let them demolish hunt times. For good players with full squads and maxed-out gear they’re already pretty short, and there are some decently deadly combos going around at the moment, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/596268332586387320/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/596268332586387320/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lala Barina longswords with paralysis</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgLk4I5CMeA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgLk4I5CMeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switch axe burst</a></span>. </p><p>But I’m still waiting for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> to have one of those infinite damage glitch moments that crop up from time to time in <em>Diablo 4</em>. In the meantime, you can pretend to capture a Gore Magala in the blink of an eye and drop the cropped screencap in the group chat to make all your friends jealous. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wanderstop-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I saw that the minds behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe-review">The Stanley Parable</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/07/the-beginners-guide-review">The Beginner’s Guide</a> were also the ones making Wanderstop, I knew what to expect… or, at least, I thought I did. I anticipated its immensely emotional story, wry sense of humor, and at least one strange twist – but while I got all of those things and more, what I didn’t see coming was that a game about making tea and avoiding burn out would force me to grapple with my own hold-ups around productivity in such an intimate way. For as sweet and wholesome as it may seem on the surface, this is a piping hot cup of tea that left a lasting mark when spilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we go any further, let me warn you: The less you know about Wanderstop’s story at the start, the better. I’m going to avoid any major spoilers, particularly since its compelling central twist arrives very early on, but a big part of the enjoyment here is following both the emotional journey of the main character, Alta, as well as the mystery surrounding the woods she finds herself in. If you already think you might enjoy a game like this without more convincing, just go play it knowing that I give Wanderstop an enthusiastic recommendation. Then you can come back here later to say, “Wow, thank you so much Ms. IGN reviewer, this game has left me feeling strangely hallowed out and yet so full at the same time.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wanderstop Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, this isn’t just a story about burn out (though playing it while actively experiencing burn out myself added a whole other level to that aspect of it). Alta is a previously undefeated arena fighter who has hit a terrible losing streak. Convinced something must be wrong with her, she heads to a mysterious forest in search of a legendary fighter to help “fix” her, but passes out from exhaustion on the way. Instead, she finds Boro, the kind and charming owner of a tea shop called Wanderstop, who presents her with a deceptively simple choice: rest and make some tea for a bit, or push herself to press on at any cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I said, this is not a story about burn out alone, but an insightful exploration of why we often burn ourselves out over and over again. Maybe you’re familiar with the feeling: You push yourself day after day not just to meet deadlines or complete projects, but to maintain that control you need over your life to stay on the right course. To keep things moving perfectly. Inevitably, you exhaust yourself until your body forces you to take a break. You rest for a bit and tell yourself it is good for you, but you’ll be right back here in no time, just as exhausted as before. The setting here may be fantastical, but this is a situation that feels firmly rooted in reality.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>An insightful exploration of why we often burn out over and over again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wanderstop is smart in how it directly calls out this toxic loop of relentless productivity. You can’t just stumble into a magical tea shop, help some other people solve their own problems, and then be “fixed” yourself. At one point, Alta says, “even relaxing feels like a job.” She’s not wrong. We’ve turned relaxing into a chore, something that must be filled with tasks: satisfying and productive. (I’m looking at you, “cozy gamers.”) I felt incredibly called out by this, personally, and it helped me realize this cycle is just not sustainable. By the end of Alta’s journey, I felt like I not only understood her a little better, but understood a part of myself I hadn’t listened to in a long time. I might even owe developer Ivy Road a therapist’s fee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some ways, Wanderstop reminds me of the tear-jerking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spiritfarer-review"><u>Spiritfarer</u></a>, as it’s very much a story-first game. When new visitors wander into the tea shop’s forest clearing, you first need to get to know them before they’ll give you a tea request, and then you must use the information you’ve gathered to brew the correct cup for them. To do that, you’ll have to grow your own ingredients in a small garden plot outside the tea shop (though you can technically plant anywhere). You’re given a field book, a limited amount of seeds, and some gentle parenting from Boro, but the rest is yours to figure out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The field book outlines the patterns you need to sow your seeds so that “plant eggs” will form, with different combinations of seed colors (blue, pink, green, and yellow) causing different plants to emerge. Once you’ve discovered a new type of plant by growing it, you can use your field guide to read up on the unique tastes and even strange effects each fruit has when brewed in tea. It’s all fairly straightforward, but gardening is still a fun little challenge as you puzzle out which color combinations are required for each plant variety. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Operating the tea machine itself is rather uncomplicated for such a complicated looking contraption. A tall ladder rotates around the giant glass pots in the center of the tea shop – you climb to the very top and pull a rope to fill the first pot with water, then climb down to smack the bellows, keeping the thermometer bar balanced to get the water to a perfect boil. Next, you climb back up, kick a lever, and the water drains into the next pot. Swing that ladder around, and it’s time to throw your tea and other ingredients in. Then all that’s left is to kick the lever to release it and pour it into a mug. The movement is so fun that you start to feel like a pro by the end, even though the tea making itself is otherwise quite simple.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every sip brings you closer to understanding Alta.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as you figure out what tea you actually need to make, of course. I really loved the little conversation-based riddles the customers give you. Sometimes figuring out the right tea ingredients was easy. They want a mint-flavored tea? Throw in a chip-chip plant, which describes its flavor as mint ice cream. But what do you do when someone asks for a tea that tastes like fruity cereal and dirt? Well, it’s a good thing there’s a delightfully whimsical fruit you can grow that tastes like whatever the drinker had the most for breakfast growing up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I loved the characters in this game in ways I didn’t anticipate, from the adorkable pretend-knight Gerald and his overbearing love for his son, to the boisterous Nana, whose fiercely competitive nature lands her shop on Wanderstop’s doorstep to try and “run you out of business.” I even liked Alta, and let’s be very clear: Alta is not a likable character. She is thick-headed, abrasive, and sometimes outright mean. But we don’t always completely love ourselves or the way we act towards others either, do we?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s great about Alta as a main character is that you get plenty of opportunities to choose interesting paths of dialogue throughout your time at Wanderstop. At first, your options might be limited to either a mean answer or a snarky answer, but as time goes on, you’ll get to choose between options that reveal a streak of humor under all of Alta’s steely resolve. With each new cup of tea she drinks, you’ll also learn about her past and how she reacts to strange new sensations, with every sip bringing you closer to understanding why Alta is the way she is.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The customers who visit Wanderstop are impressively diverse, and I’m not just talking about ethnicity or gender. Each visitor has their own unique design, drinking animation, and personality, all of which shine. Even the customers who are initially just as abrasive as Alta eventually stand out as quirky, complex people with their own deep and emotional reasons for having stumbled into Wanderstop. These characters are colorful, but it’s important that they aren't just quirky for quirky’s sake, either. Each one reflects a little bit of Alta back at her, helping to advance her own emotional journey forward, and saying goodbye as they inevitably moved on was always difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, there are Pluffins, which are adorable little penguin guys with giant eyebrows who live in a coop on the Wanderstop grounds. The joy I found in stumbling across these little kleptomaniacs, picking them up and shaking them around to drop whatever package or seed they’d stolen, was immense. And yes, you <em>can</em> pet the Pluffins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I knew I was in for a musical treat as well when I learned C418, one of the Minecraft composers, was behind the soundtrack for Wanderstop. The music itself doesn’t just fill the empty spaces, it tells its own stories. Each customer has their own musical theme, so even though their conversations didn’t have any voice acting, they all felt deeply engrossing. On top of this, the music of the clearing will subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) change over time and with major story moments. Themes that once felt comforting and idyllic can abruptly become unnerving with impressive precision.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The lovable characters aren't just quirky for quirky’s sake.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides growing your own strange fruits and collecting tea leaves to brew new drinks, your stay at Wanderstop also equips you with a trusty broom and garden shears. You can use these to tidy up the clearing of little piles of leaves or gnarly, spiky weeds. But the refreshingly strange thing is that there is no tangible incentive to do so. The weeds pose no real danger to your garden, and while walking through them can slow you down, they don’t <em>need </em>to be sheared in order to pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you tidy the leaves and weeds, you do have a small chance of finding something hidden underneath the clutter. Dozens of little trinkets can be uncovered while you clean, including colorful new tea mugs, teddy bears, and even lost packages. The catch, however, is that you can’t keep these trinkets as the roughly 15-hour campaign progresses, and the story directly addresses why in a clever way. As Boro reminds Alta at one point, just because you can’t take the decorations you love with you, is that any reason not to make your surroundings more beautiful while you’re here? Isn’t decorating for the sake of enjoying your own personal space enough on its own?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lost packages, on the other hand, are mysterious parcels that somehow wound up in the clearing, and they can be sent back out into the world via the strange mailbox outside Wanderstop’s doors. There’s no “reward” for doing so like you might expect in other games, but you will receive a letter in response that is usually worth the effort. These letters string together to form funny little gags made up of stories occurring outside the clearing, adding a lovely little dose of humor to your cleaning.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Shailyn’s Favorite Emotional Games</h3><p>For those times when you just need to have a good cry</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wanderstop might technically be a “cozy” game in this way, but it is not a comfortable one. Sure, making tea and cleaning up the tea shop is fun and relaxing, and solving each customer’s tea order is just challenging enough. But I cried during my first playthrough. A <em>lot</em>. There were times when I felt like I was grieving – not just over a sad moment or for the loss of a character, but also a loss of self. Wanderstop constantly put me up against situations that were not just uncomfortable, but that intentionally went against the grain of what you normally expect from these types of games in order to make its point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not a bad thing, though, as pushing you out of your comfort zone is very much the idea. By the end of my playthrough, I didn’t want to leave. I knew I’d done everything I could – I’d talked to all the customers, I’d grown every single type of plant, and I’d tasted almost every type of tea. Alta was at the end of her journey, and so was I. But I still didn’t want to go. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The warmth that emanates from Wanderstop isn’t that of a warm hug. It’s the warmth that spreads through your fingers from a hot cup of tea, made by someone you love, while you sit in their kitchen with tears welling up in the back of your throat. It’s a painful journey through a safe and inviting space that asks you not just to rest, but to really do the work of unpacking what brought you to rock bottom in the first place.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This week alone, Scopely, a subsidiary of a company owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought <em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, and Capcom <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/hk-en/20250310342980/en/Capcom-Announces-Partnership-with-the-Esports-World-Cup%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struck a three-year deal</a> with Saudi Arabia’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-saudi-money-overwatch-soft-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less-popular-than-it-wants-you-to-believe</a> Esports World Cup. In both cases, the implications are unsettling, to say the least.</p><p>Scopely’s $3.85 billion purchase of <em>Pokémon Go</em> also includes <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, and, in all likelihood, your data. <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late last year</a>, <em>Pokémon Go </em>creator Niantic announced that it was using the game to create an AI model that can navigate the physical world – a scheme players scarcely could have imagined back when they first opted into its terms of service back in 2016 – and now it’s spinning that project off into a separate business called Niantic Spatial. As <a href="https://www.404media.co/saudi-arabia-buys-pokemon-go-and-probably-all-of-your-location-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 points out</a>, Scopely is investing $50 million in that new venture, suggesting an ongoing relationship between the two:</p><blockquote><p>What is happening here, then, is that an already very complicated and vast location data ecosystem that was previously controlled by only one American company (Niantic) has now become a far more complicated location data ecosystem controlled by an “American” company that is wholly owned by a Saudi Arabian conglomerate whose largest shareholder is the Saudi Arabian government. <em>Pokémon Go</em> and all of the games Niantic is selling to Scopely require a player’s location in order to work at all, and <em>Pokémon Go</em> is partially monetized with in-game, location-targeted ads.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no world in which Scopely does not collect players’ locations moving forward. But what remains unclear is what is going to happen with location data moving forward and what is going to happen with historic location data.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>While of comparatively less consequence, Capcom’s deal with the Esports World Cup is nonetheless another telling example of how Saudi Arabia’s playing the game. This is a long-term relationship that will make EWC functionally unavoidable within <em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s official esports ecosystem. According to <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/03/capcom-signs-street-fighter-focused-multi-year-partnership-with-the-esports-world-cup-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esports Advocate</a>, “the top eight players from CAPCOM CUP 1 and 12 players from the <em>Street Fighter</em> League: World Championship will get direct qualification for the EWC 2025 <em>Street Fighter 6</em> Finals” and “an additional 10 slots will be awarded to winners of the Capcom Pro Tour 2025 events, including Evo Japan and Vegas, CPT Combo Breaker, Blink Respawn, and CPT CEO.” EWC-related activations will also appear in <em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s in-game interface.</p><p>So basically, if you enjoy <em>Street Fighter 6</em> or even count yourself as a casual observer of centerpiece events like Evo, you’ll be unable to escape the looming specter of the Esports World Cup.</p><p>If you’d like to brush up on Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuse record – which includes such hits as hostility against women and LGBTQA+ people, as well as apparent war crimes in Yemen and “death sentences following grossly unfair trials” – <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Rights Watch</a> have you covered. Companies and publications will try to make this normal, as they have in the sporting world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-warhammer-40000-dataslate-update-makes-moderate-changes-across-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has released a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> dataslate update. This update to the grimdark sci-fi tabletop miniatures game includes numerous adjustments to units, mechanics, and updates to various FAQs and errata.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/goxjzhii/warhammer-40000-balance-dataslate-heres-whats-changed-in-the-41st-millennium/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop released details on the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> dataslate update. This update affects all armies in the game and can either be downloaded for free through your browser or through a Warhammer app.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-ork-artwork.jpg?itok=T2T-_SWk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-ork-artwork.jpg?itok=Km9FatIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post goes into further detail about some key changes in the dataslate. The Adeptas Sororitas' Miracle Dice has been changed slightly. Now you'll get one of these dice every time one of your units dies. Several units have had their recruitment points adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>The Adeptas Custodes have had some of their units' recruitment points changed as well. The Blade Champion, Custodian Wardens, Venerable Contemptor Dreadnought, Telemon Dreadnought have increased. Alternatively, the Aleya, Custodian Guard, Knight-Centura, and Shield Captains have had their recruitment cost reduced.</p>

<p>The machine-spirit worshipping Adeptus Mechanicus have gotten a slight change. Their Bellisarius Cawl and Tech-Priest Dominus units have gotten a slight cost reduction. Furthermore, the Aeldari army's named unit Asurmen's Hand of Asuyran ability has been adjusted. It is now an Anti-Infantry 5+ ability, reducing its Devastating Wounds potential.</p>

<p>The rank-and-file troops of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Astra Militarum</a> received several adjustments in the new Warhammer 40,000 dataslate. The Firing Hot Stratagem now only applies to targeting enemy units within 12 " of the model, and the Krieg Engineers' Remote Mines have been reduced to inflicting 1d3 mortal wounds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-chaos-daemons-artwork.jpg?itok=vfOM5WcS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-dataslate-chaos-daemons-artwork.jpg?itok=5fhwERCv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Chaos Demons' Legion of Excess detachment has gotten a rework. The Seductive Gambit rule has been changed where dice re-rolls to wound or hit only applies within their Shadow of Chaos. The Thieves of Pain Stratagem now explicitly states the unit intercepting the damage must be able to see the target. Lastly, battle-shock is now gone from the Overwhelming Excess stratagem.</p>

<p>Lastly, the supersoldiers of the Imperium of Man, the Space Marines, have gotten some changes. The new dataslate now makes it clear the Oath of Moment Army Rule only applies if you only use units found in the Space Marines Codex. No Black Templars, no Blood Angels, Deathwatch, or Space Wolves allowed if you want that extra +1 to wound.</p>

This Legendary Arc trace rifle is far more effective in PvE than PvP activities due to the perks it can roll with. Having said that, Keraunios also receives plenty of buffs from Heresy Artifact, as it focuses on Arc abilities and damage output. Here's how to get it and the Keraunios god roll perks to look out for.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</a><ul><li><a href="#Keraunios_god_rolls_">Keraunios god rolls </a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</a></li><li><a href="#Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Keraunios">How to get Keraunios</h2><p dir="ltr">Keraunios can drop from any Guardian Games weapons source, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rushdown-guide-boss-rush-challenge-rewards-and-encounters-explained/1100-6530070/">Rushdown </a>or by completing objectives given by Eva Levante in the Tower for the duration of the event. Doing the Rushdown mode is the most effective way to get your hands on Keraunios quickly, as if you defeat at least three bosses in a single run, you're guaranteed a Guardian Games weapon drop. Keraunios is exclusive to Guardian Games, so remember that once the event is over, you will no longer be able to obtain it. At least, not until 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Guardian Games event challenges also include a guaranteed Keraunios drop. All you need to do is earn and deposit any medal from the games in the Tower event area. Completing the first step in the Best in Class quest, collected from Eva Levante, will also give you a Keraunios. Remember that you need to equip or use the Guardian Games class item as an ornament for rewards to drop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412"></a><figcaption>Keraunios</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_god_rolls_"><span>Keraunios god rolls</span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Light Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">Handling +10, Reload Speed +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Recycled Energy or Eddy Current  <ul><li dir="ltr">Recycled Energy: Reloading after defeating targets grants energy to your lowest charged ability.</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current: Temporarily increases reload speed and handling after sprinting or while Amplified.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Jolting Feedback, Detonator Beam, or Rolling Storm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback: Dealing repeated damage applies Jolt.

As standard, it fires accurate bursts of Arc energy at enemies, but with the right roll it turns into a lethal laser gun. Adding secondary effects, such as Jolt, increases the amount of outgoing damage as well as having the ability to disrupt enemy attacks. While we've opted to improve the handling of the weapon, you can also Masterwork its reload speed to complement the Light Battery, and we'd recommend this option first if you chose Eddy Current over Recycled Energy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +7, Stability +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Projection Fuse  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Dynamic Sway Reduction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves accuracy and stability while continuously holding down the trigger.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Masterwork: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">From our selections above, it might seem obvious that we're aiming for a huge increase on the Keraunios' average range. In a fast-paced PvP environment, it's not the strongest weapon you can take to the Crucible. It's still impressive and has the potential to put up a fight against the most formidable Guardians. Closing Time is great for boosting stats that will help you win in close fights, including range, although the magazine needs to be half-empty in order for it to trigger, so don't get too enthusiastic with your manual reloading.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for other new guns, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/">Lotus Eater sidearm god rolls</a>.

On the Dew Drinkers Discord and Mountain Dew subreddit, you can often spot people sharing photos of their collections. Because there are so many variants of Mountain Dew and some of them are rarer than others, collecting all of them, just the super-rare versions, or simply one’s personal favorites has become a big part of the community. </p><p>Some of these collectors empty the cans and bottles out, displaying them like figurines or pieces of art. But others keep the liquid in the containers, sometimes drinking them years later with mixed results. And one of these collectors, West_Yogurtcloset497 on Reddit, had the worst thing happen to him recently when a single, unnoticed leaky can caused a devasting chain reaction. </p><h2 id="h260519"><a id=""></a>A Mountain Dew disaster</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On March 9</a></span>, West_Yogurtcloset497—who has been collecting Dew for about three years—checked on his collection of Mountain Dew cans still sitting comfortably in their boxes. What he discovered was horrible. The boxes were soaked and dozens and dozens of cans were leaking. </p><p>“There was a pool of [Mountain Dew] Maui Burst on the floor,” West_Yogurtcloset497 told <em>Kotaku</em> via DMs. “I thought my cat had peed there. I cleaned it up and went about my day. The next day, the [puddle] was there and I investigated.”</p><p>However, it wasn’t cat urine that he had found. Instead, his collection of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-true-crime-story-of-a-gamefaqs-user-who-just-wanted-1847161600">Mountain Dew</a></span> cans were leaking soda all over each other and the wall. According to the collector, he’d had most of those cans for about a year and had been storing them in his room while he went to college about two hours away, which made it hard for him to check on the collection. And despite keeping the cans upright, a tactic used by many collectors to avoid blowouts caused by weight crushing the weaker sides of the cans, a leak ruined everything. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->West_Yogurtcloset497 / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-recommend-id="image://dc0b504d8077c26c1824666109d30f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Presumably, one can from the very top was faulty out of the factory, and leaked,” explained the collector. “The acid decayed the other cans causing them to leak, which exponentially killed more and more cans over the months.”</p><p>After discovering the soda destruction—the collector says he lost about 100 to 125 cans—and cleaning up the sugary mess, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mountaindew/comments/1j7jcy0/psa_check_up_on_your_cans_frequently_and_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West_Yogurtcloset497 posted images</a></span> of what happened on the Mountain Dew subreddit, adding: “PSA Check up on your cans frequently and make sure they are stored correctly.”</p><h2 id="h260520"><a id=""></a>Community reactions and the future</h2><p>In the comments below, people commiserated with the collector about his loss and shared similar stories of times they were screwed over by a leaky can or bottle.

It tasted like metal and got flu like symptoms a day after.” </p><p>I asked West_Yogurtcloset497 if he drank any of the leaky cans before throwing them away. “Nah. No telling how long some of them were open.” He did try some of the cans that survived the Dew-pocalypse and says they were still carbonated and tasted “fine.” </p><div><p>Thankfully, due to cold weather, his room wasn’t filled with ants or other bugs and there wasn’t a nasty smell. However, he did confirm that his wall is ruined and will need to be cleaned and fixed up. As for the future, the collector tells me that he will continue to store cans, but has learned a valuable lesson in how to do so properly. </p><p>“[I won’t] keep the cans in the boxes anymore,” said West_Yogurtcloset497. “And make sure to check on them frequently. I knew cans eventually leak, but I had no idea that a single leaking can could kill most of my can collection.” </p></div><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
