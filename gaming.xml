			<p>No matter whether it’s a book, movie or video game, there’s a special, deep-seated satisfaction to returning to a world that you know and love. Pandora is such a world. Home to the Na’vi, and bursting with neon flora and fauna, incredible creatures and the iconic floating islands, James Cameron’s fictional planet remains amongst the most vibrantly-realised sci-fi settings of the modern era. From the Ashes takes us back to this place, a new expansion for Ubisoft’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Frontiers of Pandora</a>, while tying in with Avatar: Fire and Ash, the brand-new cinematic outing for the franchise. It’s a return that’s well worth making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes: LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xe30wUKlV8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This time out, you play as So’lek, the Na’vi warrior who you fought alongside in the first game. Your original character is here as well – initially referred to as simply ‘The Sarentu’ – but So’lek makes for an interesting new central character that is brusque and thoughtful in equal measure. Set two weeks after the events of Avatar: Fire and Ash, you come face-to-face with the Mangkwan, the new Na’vi clan of brutal, vicious warriors who’ve aligned themselves with the RDA, here led by Major Bukowski, against the peace-loving groups we’ve come to know.</p>



<p>I held off working on the later portion of my review so that I could see the movie without ruining it, but I really didn’t have to. There’s nothing in From the Ashes that you can’t parse from watching one of the trailers for Fire and Ash, and the events here happen within their own pocket of Pandora, just as in the original game, the narrative fitting within and alongside that of Jake Sully and his extended family.</p>

<p>The world is on fire. The beauty of Pandora has been marred by flame, smoke and ash, and it makes for a striking point of difference from the main game. It still looks incredible, the beautiful landscapes punctuated by destruction making for an evocative and painful change to the setting, and it still stands as a huge technical achievement.</p>

<p>From The Ashes is also the perfect chance to check out the technical improvements that have been made to the game since its release. There’s the addition of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-patch-is-coming-in-december/">a third-person mode and a 40fps graphical option on console</a>, for use with 120Hz supporting screens and TVs, which strikes a midpoint between the previous quality and performance settings. Both of these improvements serve to give players a greater variety of ways to experience both Frontiers of Pandora and its new expansion.</p>
<p>As someone who played across PC and PS5, the 40fps option definitely lifts the console experience, bringing an improved level of fidelity over the performance mode, while still giving players a smoother and more fluid feeling experience over 30fps play. It’s not quite perfect – there were definitely occasional hiccups here and there – but overall, I found it a major improvement, and it became my preferred way to play through From The Ashes.</p>

<p>The third-person view, however, isn’t as successful. Having played the game in first person, shifting to third person actively reduces one of the game’s greatest strengths: its visuals. You lose the immediacy, and the wider field of view when in third-person, and while it does serve to cement your place as a Na’vi, it’s not a strong enough payoff when compared to first person play. Still, having the option is ideal, and you can switch at any point if there are sections that you think would be easier or better from a particular viewpoint, just as the game already did when you hopped on your flying companion to get around.</p>
<p>All of the overt strengths of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are here too, from the exceptional visuals to the enjoyable traversal and high-octane flight. From the Ashes is a bit less open-ended, though that affords for some tense and well-paced narrative moments. For all that, you can still wander off into the jungle and lose yourself to hunting and exploration for as long as you like. For returning players, though, it’s all going to be about the continuing story.</p>

<p>And that story is a real success. The tighter, more personal focus is arguably even better than the one from the main game. You begin exploring through areas that you previously experienced, marred by both the unstoppable power of Pandora’s flora and fauna, and the arrival of the Mangkwan, before settling into exploring and fighting your way through the smoking forest. It gives you more context and understanding of the new faction, and the villainous RDA, and frankly, it makes them even more imposing, with some great encounters and narrative moments across the DLC’s significant 20-hour runtime.</p>

			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> will launch its eleventh <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> expansion pack, <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">this coming <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>. To prepare for that expansion, the studio has pushed a <strong>pre-expansion update</strong> live, which will feature access to some of the features coming in Midnight ahead of its full release. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/">housing was added in an earlier update last month</a>, this update introduces a couple of additions to housing, including <strong>Endeavours</strong>, a new optional neighbourhood activity for players to engage in to unlock more décor for the homes they're building and some extra housing experience points.</p>



<p>There's also a new class specialization in the <strong>Devourer Demon Hunter</strong>, a new mid-range caster specialization that uses the power of the Void to fight the Void's own champions that threaten Azeroth. You get all the mobility of Demon Hunters while also gaining a new Annihilator hero talent tree, shared between Vengeance and Devourer Demon Hunters.</p>

<p>The update also introduces an overhaul to the Transmorgification system, letting players change appearance to gear slots instead of individual items, so you can keep your transmogs even when swapping gear. You're also now able to establish set outfits, with every player starting with two free outfits, though you can purchase additional outfit slots with gold.</p>



<p>You can even set your outfit to change based on specific scenarios now with the new '<strong>Situations</strong>' system, if you want to have specific looks for dungeon running, exploration, or just chilling at home.</p>



<p>Beyond the housing updates and the new class specialization, the pre-expansion update also adds several key UI changes, with new 'Boss Warnings' and 'Damage Meter' changes. You can see the highlighted changes in the images below.</p>

<p>There are several more changes, tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes in the pre-expansion update as Blizzard prepares for the full weight of the Midnight expansion when it arrives this coming March. There's a full, expansive list of everything in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244455/midnight-pre-expansion-content-update-notes">a new blog post from Blizzard</a> that goes through all of the details.</p>



<p>So far, Midnight is looking like it'll be the biggest expansion in World of Warcraft's long history, a history that, for now, remains entirely PC-based, as it's one of the most popular games ever to not come to consoles. The last word on a potential console port from Blizzard was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">if it was happening, the team "<em>would just say it</em>" was happening</a>. So, for now, take any rumours on an imminent console launch with a grain of salt. Once the team is working on bringing it to consoles, it'll let us know.</p>

It now looks as though the studio will be able to keep to this latest release date.</p>
<p>Though <em>Crimson Desert </em>began life as a prequel to Pearl Abyss' <em>Black Desert Online</em>, it eventually morphed into a standalone adventure.</p><p>Taking place in the world of Pywel, <em>Crimson Desert </em>features an in-depth combat system with plenty of moves and tactical options to master, as well as a range of other activities including fishing, hunting, and cooking.</p><p>You'll be able to play <em>Crimson Desert </em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crimson-desert/9NG592G0W474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 19th.

            <title><![CDATA[Game Trailer Showcased By IGN Slammed For Using AI ‘Placeholders’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-trailer-showcased-by-ign-slammed-for-using-ai-placeholders-2000661829</link>
            <guid>1412053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“Hell is empty and all the devils are here.” That quote from Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest</em> is how the debut trailer for hack-and-slash adventure game <em>Fallen</em> begins. It was accurate if you count among those devils <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">the scourge of AI slop</a>. The trailer, an<em> IGN</em> exclusive, was flamed on social media for appearing to showcase gen AI work, and the developer of the game later confirmed it.</p> <p>The <em>Fallen</em> trailer <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/2013061346544205904">appeared on X on Monday</a> where it immediately made a splash far beyond what you might have expected from its otherwise generic-looking, demon-slaying gameplay. “Introducing <em>Fallen</em>, a new Xbox 360-era inspired character action game where you play as Astra, a fallen angel who must battle through Hell and its demonic forces. It’s in development for console and PC,” read the marketing copy.</p>

 <p>But what stood out to people immediately was the now familiar whiff of slick but lifeless gen AI-produced art that was peppered throughout the trailer. “It looks nauseatingly bad, genAI isn’t just walking back gaming hardware, it’s trying to make the games themselves awful too,” <a href="https://x.com/kitty_bit_games/status/2013287905272148309">wrote</a> cosplayer Kitty Bit. “This is the most AI ass AI video game I ever did see lmao,” <a href="https://x.com/Ms5000Watts/status/2013103413656248810">wrote</a> Twitch streamer Ms5000watts. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Looks like a weird amalgamation of AI and jank,” read one of the top YouTube comments.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They aren't even trying to hide it brah😭😭AI slop content is off the charts now <a href="https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8">https://t.co/uWFQdopCy8</a> <a href="https://t.co/b0B9Jnm8aq">pic.twitter.com/b0B9Jnm8aq</a></p> <p>— Oshbard (@Ludvicus) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ludvicus/status/2013329329246105904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Was this another example of people being paranoid about gen AI and jumping the gun with the accusations of slop? Nope! Superboo Studios founder, director, producer, and writer Brooke Burgess admitted as much after the backlash, but claimed the gameplay was real and in-engine UE5.4 work. Burgess blamed “context” collapse for the controversy.</p>

 <p>“What ended up being shared as an ‘official trailer’ was actually our early dev ‘tone pitch’, i.e., a work-in-progress UE5 teaser designed for funding discussions,” he <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallen-gen-ai-real-in-engine-ue54-work/">told <em>TheGamer</em></a>. “There are [AI-Generated] placeholders in there, specifically some 2D test assets used to explore mood and presentation (for example, how ‘lost souls’ and fallen angels in the game might react when spoken to and judged, along w/ WIP HUD elements). That material was never intended as final content, nor as a statement on how the shipped game would be made.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661842"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661842">YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p>To go back to referencing Shakespeare for a moment, Burgess seems to be suggesting that “the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our ‘tone pitch AI placeholders,’ but in ourselves.” He makes it sound like <em>IGN</em> posted the wrong trailer, or jumped the gun. In actuality, Burgess has had <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGjCTo9iLU/7_O1MHOJhcdacvds06knLg/edit">no qualms about using AI slop</a> to pitch the game to potential investors.</p> <p>In fact, he recently complained about just how hard it is to raise money for making a game right now. Burgess said every publisher he’s spoken to is asking how he’ll us AI to streamline development. He’s open to using it for QA and localization, but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.” but claims he’s not “waving the flag of AI by any stretch.”</p>

 <p>“I’m not going to sell my soul and be like, ‘Yeah, I’ll do it by myself, let me prompt this whole game into existence,'” he recently told <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallen-creator-brooke-burgess-on-the-struggle-to-get-game-funding-above-1-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a></em>. “No, I want to work with really talented people and make something cool. But if integrating it in a way that doesn’t affect creativity, but helps to save a little bit of money and gets the game out there to people, and gives us a chance to make something cool and memorable, and then make something else after that–it’s something I have to factor in.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876"><em>Fallout</em> season two</a>‘s latest episode provided one of the coolest reveals in the show’s run and was also a great moment for fans of “Pointing at the TV and going ‘Oh crap!'” in front of their friends and then getting to explain why they were so excited.</p> <p>But wait. Before we go any further, we’re about to completely spoil that cool moment (and only that moment) from season two, episode six of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show that brings back not one, but two classic elements from the old <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-easter-egg-pokes-fun-at-lore-inconsistencies-1830500018"><em>Fallout</em></a> games. So if you want to avoid that, this is the part where you turn around and never look back. Everyone else, keep scrolling.</p>

  <p>After being super-punched through a window at the end of the last episode and left for dead by Lucy, the Ghoul is saved from his spikey predicament by a large, strange-looking figure. That figure is revealed to be a Super Mutant. Yup, the <em>Fallout</em> show has finally brought these big ol’ bastards into the series, and I’m happy to see they aren’t the brutish-looking monsters so frequently depicted in Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games. Instead, this Super Mutant looks and sounds a lot like the kind seen in the older <em>Fallout</em> CRPGs and<em> New Vegas.</em></p> <p>Technically, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_mutant_(TV_series)?file=The_Target_-_Mutant_corpse.png">a dead Super Mutant appeared in season one in an Enclave base</a>, though we only saw its large green hand sticking out from underneath a sheet. But this is the first time we’ve seen a living Super Mutant in the show. That alone would be cool enough, but there’s more to this moment. The actor behind the Super Mutant makeup is Ron Perlman, a man who has a long history with the <em>Fallout</em> franchise.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">SUPER MUTANT have arrived in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fallout?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fallout</a> and he wanted o join Ghoul in his kind <a href="https://t.co/30PD4PpZ0p">pic.twitter.com/30PD4PpZ0p</a></p> <p>— sanmeyo (@oyemnassxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/oyemnassxo/status/2013911587736916414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The movie and TV actor has acted as a narrator in most of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284"><em>Fallout</em> games</a>, including the original ones back in the ’90s. He’s the guy who famously says, “War. War never changes,” at the start of so many <em>Fallout</em> adventures, and who also often provides a recap of your choices and their outcomes at the end. He also appears in <em>Fallout 4</em> as a TV newscaster you can hear in the background during the game’s intro.&nbsp; And now he’s here for the <em>Fallout</em> TV show, and I’m very happy about it.</p>

 <p>It’s good to have you back, Perlman. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136">Hopefully, you got paid more than $40 and a sandwich for this role.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Perlman’s Super Mutant character, after saving the Ghoul, mentions that the ones to blame for all of this are the Enclave, a mysterious group of fascists that planned to take over the United States before the bombs fell. The group later claimed to be the inheritors of the United States’ power and authority after the world ended. And it seems they are going to play a big role in the final episodes of <em>Fallout</em> season two.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-steam-how-to-buy-price/</link>
            <guid>1412041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam is the go-to for most PC gamers. It has almost every game in existence, but some are conspicuously absent, and questions have been asked about Arknights: Endfield. That query will be quashed with a definitive answer, and you’ll also get insight into the game’s price and where to buy it.</p>



<p>Whether you have a gaming laptop or a class PC rig with enough RGB to light up a dark basement, Steam is traditionally the place everyone goes to buy PC games. The odd game deviates from this model. Let’s check if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> follows in the footsteps of other games—like Hytale—by not launching on Steam right away.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-arknights-endfield-on-steam">Can You Buy Arknights: Endfield On Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ember’s happy, but PC gamers won’t be. Credit to Hypergryph</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>For some reason, Arknights: Endfield is not available to purchase through Steam and needs to be bought via different means on PC.</strong></p>



<p>The closest thing you’ll find to Arknights: Endfield on Steam is the rudimentary-looking, fan-made ‘Ark: Release.’ You’ll find nothing about Endfield on Steam, nor any traces related to it.</p>



<p>If you want to buy Arknights: Endfield, you need to be whisked away elsewhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-buy-arknight-endfield-on-pc">How To Buy Arknight: Endfield On PC</h2>



<p><strong>You can download and buy Arknights: Endfield through the Windows App and the Epic Games Store on PC.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has covered the purchase process extensively in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield Pre-Download guide</a>. However, it really is as simple as going to the applicable storefronts, purchasing it, downloading the game’s launcher, and installing the game, ready to play.</p>



<p>It remains unclear if a Steam version will ever become available. If it does, this guide’s content will be updated to reflect the new information.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-arknights-endfield-price-explained">How Much Is Arknights: Endfield? Price Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield is a free-to-play action-adventure game, which means you can tie up those purse strings and keep your wallet shut, ready to splurge on future games.</strong></p>



<p>There might be some confusion over the game’s cost if you check out the PS5 store listing, for example. Make no mistake, Arknights: Endfield is F2P. But you can buy a special edition for $9.99 or £7.99, and it comes with the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Basic HH Permit ×5.</li>



<li>T-Creds ×50000.</li>



<li>Intermediate Combat Record ×10.</li>



<li>Arms Inspector ×10.</li>



<li>Fortifying Infusion ×10.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a free-to-play title, but there’s a huge emphasis on its gacha elements and microtransactions. If you get sucked into Arknights: Endfield, it could be a worryingly expensive rabbit hole you get yourself stuck in.</p>



<p>For a game of this size and substance, it’s a good package. Although it’s totally understandable if you think this should be F2P. Let IG know your thoughts on the game, its price, and more through the free-to-join and ever-growing <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <p>The sixth episode of Fallout season two has just aired on Prime, and with it given viewers and fans a fun cameo to look out for.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Just a week or so on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman's revelation that he was paid "$40 and a sandwich" for his first Fallout gig in the 90s</a> - which saw him narrating the RPG complete with his iconic "War. War never changes" line - the actor has now popped up in the TV series, decades later.</p>
<p>Perlman plays the part of a Fallout Super Mutant in the show, who liberates Walton Goggins' Ghoul from that pole he was impaled on at the end of last week's episode (I am still wincing from that scene).</p>
<p>In the show's Fallout, Perlman's Super Mutant again mentions "war", telling the Ghoul there is one coming, and so "we need you healthy". He then helps sort out that whopping great hole in the Ghoul's abdomen.</p>
<p>"They call us abominations, but they created our kind," Perlman's character tells the Ghoul as he heals. 'They', of course, refers to Fallout's nefarious Enclave, which seems to have its fingers in the Vault-Tec pie. "Ghouls, mutants, we're kin," Perlman's Super Mutant continues, "and we should unite against our common enemy."</p><p>Perlman's Super Mutant is putting together an army against the "people who set all this in motion", but what that could actually mean for the rest of Fallout season two remains to be seen, as no sooner than we get a glimpse of Perlman's mutilated face, he bops the Ghoul over the head to keep his location a secret. Hmmm, curious!</p>

<p>There are still two more episodes of Fallout season two left to go, and things are heating up in the wasteland. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, filming for the third season of Fallout <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">is expected to begin this May</a>. Don't expect to see a similar Perlman cameo from Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, though. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard said last month, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it</a>.</p>

            <p>Much has been written over the years on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>'s quality and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/souls-week-dark-souls-2-is-the-best-dark-souls-game-that-isnt-dark-souls-or-dark-souls-3">whether it reached the heights of its relatives</a>. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter, as the sequel has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/335300/charts/#max">consistently attracted players over the years</a> and with two different versions of the same gruelling action-RPG adventure.</p>
<p>Those who really enjoyed FromSoftware's Miyazaki-less entry have also tried to celebrate it with yearly 'Return to Drangleic' community events, and now we know when 2026's is going to happen thanks to Reddit's most active Dark Souls communities.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1qgmvjq/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/darksouls</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/1q6ueqo/return_to_drangleic_2026/">r/DarkSouls2</a>, different users started to promote the two weeks-ish period starting on 26th February and ending on 13th March. Some say it's starting a day later, but it's all agreed upon otherwise. Chances are the servers across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC will be seeing an uptick before then, as the game has never gone inactive. Still, you should expect to see more jolly cooperation (and heinous invasions) happening around that time.</p>
<p>As explained by the vets on the relevant subreddits, the 'Return to Drangleic' events are the perfect opportunities for newcomers to jump in too, as getting through Dark Souls 2's worst areas is far easier with seasoned adventurers by your side. The second instalment is often described as the trilogy's most brutal and unforgiving, with enemy placement being troll-y at times and key mechanics like its take on humanity and max HP being a bit annoying. Most players agree it's the entry with the most interesting approach to covenants and PvP on the other hand.</p><p>As a reminder, the original PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Dark Souls 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-2-ps3-xbox-360-servers-to-shut-down">went offline a few years ago</a>, so you'll need to own the Scholar of the First Sin edition to join the fun; same story on PC. We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-3">March</a> are looking stacked when it comes to all-new game releases, but it's never a bad time to mess around in the Dark Souls games.</p>
<p>By the way, 2026 will mark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s 10th anniversary, and the rumour mill has been saying for a while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-is-in-development-its-claimed/">a remaster could be happening</a> to celebrate the occasion. The ride never ends.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-is-already-getting-its-second-price-cut-this-year-hitting-another-record-low-2000661451</link>
            <guid>1412005</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most modern TVs deliver impressive visuals, but the built-in sound quality usually doesn’t keep up. Not being able to hear the dialogue and music properly can be frustrating, but you don’t have to put up with that.</p>
<p>This is where a dedicated soundbar can help, and today is an excellent time to invest in one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Amazon just knocked a solid 30% off the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus, bringing its price down to $175</a>. You’re saving a nice $75 on a solution that’s going to make your favorite TV shows and movies a lot more enjoyable by delivering an immersive experience. Just note that deals this good don’t tend to stick around. It’s worth acting sooner rather than later to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>This minimal soundbar features an elegant, no-fuss design. You can place it on your console or mount it on the wall for an even cleaner setup; whichever you prefer. Sound-wise, it covers more than just the basics. There are three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, all of which come together to push sound in every direction, instead of just blasting it from the front. Clear audio with deep bass surrounds you from all sides with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, making it feel like you’re right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>Dialogs get better, too. That’s thanks to the dedicated center dialogue channel that sharpens conversations to help you catch every mumble and whisper. You won’t have to constantly rewind to hear what was said or rely on subtitles to understand the context. Basically, whether you’re watching something action-packed or winding down with a slow, romantic Korean show, you’ll enjoy each sound and every tune just how the creator intended. This 3D setup is also great for watch parties at home, as it ensures everyone enjoys clear, immersive sound no matter where they’re seated in the room.</p>



<p>You can also choose between multiple sound modes, which automatically optimize audio based on what you’re watching. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. For instance, the movie mode offers better dialog clarity, while the music mode pumps up the bass. The night mode, on the other hand, reduces the overall volume so you don’t wake the rest of the house. What’s more, the soundbar can double as a speaker, as it lets you wirelessly connect devices like your smartphone and tablet via Bluetooth easily. Use it to catch up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, or vibe to some music while finishing up chores around the house!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. All you need to do is connect the included HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI eARC/ARC port. Once the TV recognizes the soundbar, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. Compatibility-wise, the soundbar plays nicely with a range of smart TVs and TVs connected to streaming media players. You can also control it using the same remote you already use for your TV.</p>
<p>Everything considered, it’s a great option to invest in if you want to enjoy better sound for all your content. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">It’s now down to $175 after a 30% discount, but the offer won’t be around for long. It’s best to grab it fast to avoid paying the full price later.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer? Co-op & Multiplayer, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer-co-op-multiplayer-explained/</link>
            <guid>1411999</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a new gacha-RPG, then Arknights: Enfield might be for you. But we all know gaming is better with friends, so there’s one question on everyone’s mind—does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> have multiplayer?</p>



<p>The game will expand the Arknights universe, which was founded with the original Arknights back in May 2019. Instead of the former tower-defence gameplay, you can expect a fusion between combat and factory-building. </p>







<p>If that’s enough to get you to jump into Arknights: Endfield, then Insider Gaming can let you know whether you can expect multiplayer or co-op during your time on Talos-II.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the many characters. Image by Hypergryph.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield does feature multiplayer features, but not in the traditional sense. </strong></p>



<p>You won’t find yourself stumbling across other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a>, as it’s primarily a single-player experience. However, there are some nifty multiplayer features that you can engage in with your friends, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting a friend’s reception room</li>



<li>Seeing someone’s team composition</li>



<li>Sharing Blueprints and Facilities</li>



<li>Helping friends with their OMV Dijiang</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-co-op">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield does not have co-op, but there is a chance it could be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, you’ll have to stick it out alone in Arknights: Endfield, as there won’t be any co-op at launch. That means you won’t be able to join a friend’s world, but there’s a chance that could change in the future.</p>







<p>Most games of a similar genre tend to have some form of co-op, such as Genshin Impact. Considering over 35 million people have signed up to play, it’d be a real missed opportunity if Hypergryph don’t add co-op in the future. As things stand, though, it remains a pipe dream.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert Goes Gold Two Months Before Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/</link>
            <guid>1411996</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of Crimson Desert is coming fast. On Wednesday morning, developer Pearl Abyss announced that the game has officially gone gold.</p>



<p>The “gone gold” announcement comes nearly two months before the game’s planned March 19 release date. </p>







<p><strong>“We’re thrilled to announce that Crimson Desert has gone gold,”</strong> they said on <a href="https://x.com/crimsondesert_/status/2013974920120987867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>. <strong>“On behalf of the team at Pearl Abyss, thank you to our fans around the world for your support and for reaching this milestone with us. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Stay tuned for more news, and see you in Pywel on March 19!” </strong></p>

			<p>Almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">seven years since its initial reveal</a>, during which time<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> the game was<strong> delayed</strong></a> on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple occasions</a></strong> due in part to developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> deciding to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/">entirely overhaul the direction of the game</a></strong> and what kind of game it would be, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> is finally at the finish line. Pearl Abyss has announced that its upcoming open-world, action-adventure title has <strong>gone gold</strong> ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong>, release date.</p>



<p>The March release date was revealed back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">September 2025</a></strong>, shortly after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">featured at <strong>Gamescom 2025</strong> with a playable demo</a>. But even then, it was tough to think of its March date as a lock, considering the fact that it was also featured at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/">Gamescom 2023</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a></strong>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/">a delay in between</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it's clear now that when Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">confidently claimed in <strong>June 2025</strong> that it wouldn't announce another release date until it was ready to do so,</a> it wasn't bluffing. With the game officially going gold, the studio is finally ready to put a bow on a version of Crimson Desert that it's ready to launch and put in players' hands.</p>



<p>"<em>We&nbsp;sincerely thank&nbsp;our fans around the world for being with us on this meaningful journey</em>," the team writes in a message to players in a press release. "<em>Thanks to your support, we have reached this important milestone. We look forward to welcoming you to the continent of&nbsp;Pywel&nbsp;on March 19</em>."</p>

<p>It's exciting to know that we'll finally get a chance to see the full scale of Crimson Desert, a game that we still have plenty of questions about, even after we've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/">multiple impressive gameplay showcases for</a> it over the years.</p>



<p>You can pre-order Crimson Desert for its March 19, 2026, release date now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, with the standard edition coming in at <strong>$69.99</strong> and the digital deluxe edition coming in at <strong>$79.99.</strong> There's also a <strong>$279.99</strong> collector's edition you can grab, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-1-0-launch-set-fall-2026-updated-roadmap/</link>
            <guid>1411969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, German developer <strong>Keen Games</strong> has announced an update on the <strong>Enshrouded 1.0</strong> launch estimates. The independent studio is now tracking toward a <strong>Fall 2026</strong> release of the survival game, a delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original <strong>Spring 2026</strong> estimate</a>, although even that should not be taken as a hard date, especially following the delays that characterized the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-wake-of-the-water-update-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wake of the Water update</a>.</p>



<p>Keen also shared an updated roadmap, showing that there will be one major content update before the full launch. Version <strong>0.8</strong> is expected to drop at some point in Spring, adding bug fixes, balancing, and general improvements, as well as a key feature, <strong>Adventure Sharing</strong>, which lets players share their creations with the rest of the Enshrouded community from within the game. Version 1.0 will feature an advanced version of Adventure Sharing, equipped with traps, spawners, and logic elements. The logic system, in particular, is, to a degree, similar to what the developer created for their previous game, <strong>Portal Knights</strong>.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the full version will also feature a lot of polished elements, including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improved new player experience</li>



<li>Better quest progression</li>



<li>Various performance optimizations, especially for lower end PCs, and faster shader compilation</li>



<li>Several combat improvements, such as enhanced tactical depth and enemy variety, smarter enemy behavior, and improved balancing</li>



<li>New content: locations, enemies, and more</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Enshrouded 1.0 will also bring the game to consoles, further expanding the potential audience. The game has already been a massive success for Keen Games, having surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players in the first four days</a> on early access, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three million players a few months later</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four million players in April 2025</a>, and <strong>five million users</strong> just now.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enshrouded - Road to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new milestone is just one of many data points shared in the new infographics. According to Keen's logs, players have already collectively spent around <strong>20,901 years</strong> in Enshrouded, farmed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> plants and placed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> blocks of water, tamed 6 million pets, and destroyed <strong>30 million</strong> Shroud roots. However, they also drowned <strong>nearly half a million times</strong>, while over <strong>52.5 million player deaths</strong> were caused by fall damage.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/killing-stone-is-17th-century-occult-adventure-with-deckbuilding-at-its-core</link>
            <guid>1411966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Killing Stone</em> is a new roguelite deckbuilding game with an added focus on a "17th-century occult horror narrative." This focus on story might not be as common for the genre, but for the team at developer Question, this story was always something they'd had in mind.</p><p>Last week TechRaptor had a chance to sit down with the team at Question, as well as Liam O'Brien and Emma Gregory who lend their voices to <em>The Killing Stone</em>, to learn more about the game and the process of putting it together.</p><p>At the top of our discussion, it was revealed that <em>The Killing Stone</em> will release on February 18, 2026 for PC via Steam. If you're interested in trying out the game, a demo is also currently available to play.</p><p>The story of <em>The Killing Stone</em> takes place after the death of Mariken Swangard (Emma Gregory), a powerful mage whose success was due to various deals that she took on with One Eye (Liam O'Brien) the Devil. Those sins she took on have now been passed on to the family, and the Devil is ready to collect unless Maven, the character you play as, is able to help them get out of those bad deals.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-interview-gameplay.jpg?itok=Ne52SJUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Jordan Thomas, co-owner of Question and writer and narrative director of <em>The Killing Stone</em>, explained that while they didn't set out to create a game with a narrative focus it was an obsession with a Faustian theme that pushed the development of the story. They also took inspiration from "<em>Slay The Spire, Inscription,</em> and <em>[I Was a] Teenage Exocolonist</em>, but also from <em>Firewatch, Eternal Darkness</em>, and <em>Seventh Guest</em>. Not wanting to take any on in their own turf, but to do what we can to nod to them and appreciate them."</p><p>The core gameplay loop will have the player, Maven, taking on the Devil and his lieutenants by revising the contracts that One Eye has with the different members of the family. These contract changes take place through roguelite deckbuilding battles.</p><h2>The Sins Are Present In The Decks You Play</h2><p>Each family member has a different deck with different cards, boons, and banes. Each of these buffs is tied to the family member that they represent.</p><p>As you progress from node to node you'll encounter different battles, events, and have chances to remove cursed sin cards from your deck or power up other cards.</p><p>Talking us through the combat quickly Thomas described it as "wizard chess meets poker." Thomas also explained that each deck is "meant to start oppressive, but as you bargain with the demon, things will become easier."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Explore The Mansion Between Games</h2><p>A portion of <em>The Killing Stone</em> that I got to learn more about was what you can do when you're not playing the deckbuilding portion of the game. Stepping up from the game table, Maven is able to explore the massive Swangard mansion.</p><blockquote><p>"It's all about the atmosphere and what's lying under the surface" - Liam O'Brien</p></blockquote><p>During this moment we got to see Maven move through a number of hallways and up a stairwell to a dimly lit and ominous living room with various members of the Swangard family standing around. It was explained that during the downtime you'd be able to learn more about the story and perspective on the events of the game from the characters you'll be helping along the way.</p><p>The story of <em>The Killing Stone</em> can definitely be explored on the surface by just playing through the game, but it's in these moments that you talk with members of the family and explore the mansion where you'll learn far more about what's going on.</p><p>Thomas praised games like <em>Elden Ring</em> for their emergent storytelling, teaching you about the world through character observations and item descriptions, and said that while <em>The Killing Stone</em> "isn't treating you like you're in school… through collaboration and discussion, more of the story can be pieced together."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Extra Hard Challenges Are Optional But Worth It</h2><p>The Mansion isn't just about exploration either as you can make your way to a grotto where there are chances to complete Arcane Rituals. There are additional challenges that are difficult to complete but will grant you cards that can be cycled into any of the decks going forward, giving you access to some powerful cards.</p><p>We did ask whether there would be additional hidden secrets in the Mansion that could affect gameplay, but it was explained to us that "it's not a game where you're unlocking hidden rooms or solving puzzles, these are more ambient haunting moments and optional conversations but it's a light tough."</p><h2>Audio Tracks For English and Period English</h2><p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the game's 17th-century setting is that there are multiple English language tracks for the game, one where the characters speak in what I might describe as sounding like Old English, and a second that is truly period English.</p><blockquote><p>"One [language track] is a little closer to modern language, there is also a second track where everything is ripped out of centuries old texts."</p></blockquote><p>When the text was first shown off I thought they were beginning with the period English, that was until they toggled it on and replayed the same scene and the entire scene transformed.</p><p>Gregory couldn't be more complimentary of the experience explaining "I had the most wonderful time. I was thrilled that someone had the balls to write in period speak and that to me, I just relished it. I've done a lot of Shakespeare and I love it. There were times that Liam [O'Brien], [Jordan Thomas], and I spoke for hours."</p><blockquote><div><p>'Modern' English<br>"Blood shared with me may be a component, many curses are delimited thus.

            <p>We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mochi-os-hamster-warfare-is-a-sweet-swift-sugar-rush">weaponising hamsters</a> and grizzling about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> with a word from the world of film – a film being a curious subspecies of video game that plays itself, consists partly of human souls preserved in gelatin and silver halide, and can only be ‘failed’ by skipping the post-credits scene. Whatever will the mad labcoats dream up next?</p>
<p>More specifically, it’s time for an insight from Gore Verbinski, director of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. He thinks the <a href="https://www.redsharknews.com/advancements-like-unreal-engine-5-could-mean-were-at-a-tipping-point-for-filmmaking">much-gobflapped</a> adoption of Epic’s Unreal Engine by visual effect teams is a blight upon the face of Hollywood. He thinks it’s an insult to the dignity of helicopters. OK, he doesn’t go quite that hard.</p><!--more-->
<p>Verbinski is currently doing interviews to promote Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – a sci-fi movie about Sam Rockwell returning from the future to warn of the perils of AI, which was itself very firmly made without using generative AI.</p>

<p>Asked by <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">But Why Tho</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/director-gore-verbinski-says-unreal-engine-is-the-greatest-slip-backwards-for-movie-cgi/">PCGamer</a>) to discuss the state of VFX, based on his long career of making galleons explode, Verbinski observed that “the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape. So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.”</p>
<p>I am immediately fascinated to learn what Verbinski means by a “gaming aesthetic”. All too often, interview answers tail off at this stage. Thankfully, Verbinski kept going.</p>
<p>“I think that’s why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you’ve got this different aesthetic,” he said. “It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you’re in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn’t work from a strictly photo-real standpoint.</p><p>“I just don’t think it takes light the same way; I don’t think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface, scattering, and how light hits skin and reflects in the same way. So that’s how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand.”</p>
<p>Verbinski has seen this transition play out over the course of a trilogy – as he commented, “in the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat.” I imagine Peter Jackson has similar feelings about the shift in CGI technology over the course of his Tolkien adaptations – there are few sights sadder than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2fq8tq/at_one_point_during_filming_of_the_hobbit_sir_ian/">Gandalf in a greenroom</a>. </p>
<p>Verbinski noted that many movie studio executives are absolutely fine with all this, because they are creatures of Money who don't care what real boats look like, but he himself regards the wider adoption of Unreal Engine by movie-makers as a regression. “I think in Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die, we try to be really strict with making at least 50% of the frame photographic,” he said. “I think that keeps you honest. You can use props as a reference, and when you see the CG replacement, you know how to replicate the real thing.</p>
<p>“I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya">Maya</a> as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards,” Verbinski continued. “And there’s also something, a mistake I think people make all the time on visual effects. You can make a very real helicopter. But as soon as it flies wrong, your brain knows it’s not real. It has to earn every turn; it has to move right. It’s still animation, sometimes it’s not just the lighting and the photography, sometimes it’s the motion.”</p>
<p>Old man yells at cloud, no doubt, but still, what do you think? In which Unreal Engine-based films do you detect at gaming aesthetic, whatever that means?</p>

            <p>Last week, EA followed through on plans outlined in 2025 by shutting down the servers of Bioware's Anthem. Pretty much since the shooter's fate was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">set in stone</a>, there's been the natural chatter about whether it could potentially be kept online or revived down the road in some fashion. At this early stage, there's been no huge re-emergence, but that doesn't mean folks aren't experimenting to see what such a thing might involve.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-revival-private-servers-shutdown-bioware-fan-2000661358">Kotaku</a>, a YouTuber going by And799 has posted a video of them getting the game up and running with two accounts serving as players in the same session. Seems like the majority of the player data [is] handled through Bioware's server instead of blaze and it is required for the game to be able to load offline," they observed in the video's description.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPx5SJHFvGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Now, before you get too excited, they also made sure to stress that "this is just a POC from my research and experiment and does NOT represent the current progress of the private server/revival project that is currently in progress." Adding to that, the video being posted on the Anthem subreddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfng76/anthem_client_as_server_testing_youtube/">attracted a comment</a> from a user who claims to be working with And799. "This is still a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit," this user added. "A lot of stuff clearly doesn't work as 'intended', and definitely needs at minimum, more polish."</p><p>That certainly mashes with the walls of code and text open in various windows over the course of the five-minute demo clip. So, any revival of Anthem still looks to be a ways off at current, with a project dubbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1pb8b3v/cenotaph_an_anthem_revival_project/">Cenotaph</a> whose creators previously posted about taking on that task having not updated their <a href="https://discord.gg/FwrJEJ7yMs">Discord server</a> to say anything beyond 'this is an idea we'd like to get the ball rolling on at some point' at this point.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed happening as I've taken a look around the Anthemsphere is that today, January 21st, the moderation team of r/anthemthegame have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qiwule/ranthemthegame_will_move_to_readonly_on_january/">posted plans</a> to archive the 33,000 user subreddit by making it read-only as of January 31st. "After that date, no new posts or comments can be made, but the subreddit and everything shared here will remain visible as an archive," they wrote. "We wanted to give everyone a clear heads-up ahead of time, in case you want to wrap up ongoing discussions, share a final farewell or reflection, or revisit and comment on old threads, screenshots, stories and memories. You still have about 9–10 days to do so."</p>
<p>There were quickly a couple of comments asking if it'd be possible to hold out a bit longer before taking this step, just in case efforts like And799's do yield progress towards a private server-based revival down the line. The subreddit's team have just responded to those by switching up their plans, which they say are "the result of long-term burnout and the reality that there has effectively been no active full mod team for years".</p>
<p>"It's very clear from the responses here that many of you still want this subreddit to remain a place for discussion, sharing projects, memories and potential future developments...and knowing that, it's not something that's going to be ignored," a fresh sticked comment from one of the moderators reads. "Because of that, we're pausing and rethinking the approach. If this community is going to continue, it needs solid volunteers who are genuinely willing to take on ongoing moderation responsibilities so the sub can be maintained at a level it deserves." They're encouraging folks who might fit that bill to reach out to them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modmail">via modmail</a>.</p><p>While it likely goes beyond what's achievable by a fan-run private server project without significant backing, long-time Bioware key cog Mark Darrah recently shared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-could-be-revived-as-a-trad-bioware-singleplayer-rpg-for-10-million-says-former-dragon-age-producer">his own vision for keeping Anthem going</a> as an RPG folks could try single-player, in addition to playing via local servers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time to stock up on gaming essentials, as we’re spotting quite a few top-rated accessories going for less at Amazon. One of our favorite discounts? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/">This 31% drop on the Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed wireless gaming mouse, which brings its price down to just $48.</a></p>
<p>That’s basically nothing considering all the features this tiny but mighty mouse is packed with. This price also matches its all-time low from last year. Just be sure to pick it up before the offer expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Punch</h2>
<p>The mouse’s signature shape supports different grips, making it comfortable to use by just about anyone for a range of tasks, from gaming to creative work. The nine programmable controls make it easy to have all the commands you need just a click away – quite literally. This degree of personalized control lets you perform your best during both work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The low-latency performance makes the V3 faster than most options in the same range, while the Razer 5G advanced 18K optical sensor ensures 99.4% tracking accuracy with up to 18,000 DPI. Translation? Incredible precision and speed that gives you a competitive edge in action-packed games where every second counts. You can even improve the accuracy further by disabling the “Enhance pointer precision” option in the Windows mouse settings. Those looking for more control can use the Razer Synapse app for advanced customization.</p>



<p>Durability comes from new gold-plated contact points that make the switches less prone to degradation. You’ll appreciate the longer lifespan of up to 60 million clicks, which ensures you keep enjoying consistent performance for years to come.</p>
<p>Additionally, Razor Chroma RGBL integration lets you customize the mouse using 16.8 million colors and countless lighting effects. The mouse reacts dynamically with countless Chroma-integrated games for an immersive experience that makes you feel like a part of the action. Battery life is just as impressive. You’re looking at up to 535 hours on Bluetooth and 285 hours on Razer HyperSpeed wireless. Basically, you won’t have to worry about running out of power in the middle of teaching bag guys a lesson. This also makes the mouse easy (and reliable) to take with you on your trips. Game wherever you want, however you want!</p>
<p>The mouse is compatible with a range of devices and gadgets, so you can play on your preferred one with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6807/">The Basilik V3 is now down to just $48, from its already-affordable $70 price</a>. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your gaming experience without breaking the bank, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Portuguese retailer has posted the Switch 2 release date for Borderlands 4, suggesting the game will launch on the platform on February 27, 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed indefinitely</a> back in September 2025 as the developers needed additional time to work on the game. Since then, we have yet to receive a new release date from the developers, but it might be arriving soon if the Portuguese listing is indeed true. </p>







<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-switch-2-game-key-art-listing-appears-online-with-release-date">Borderlands 4 Switch 2 Game Key Art Listing Appears Online with Release Date</h2>



<p>The Borderlands 4 Switch 2 listing has appeared on the Portuguese website, <a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Replay</a>. The listing states that the release date is set for February 27, 2026, and that it will be a Game Key Card priced at €69.99. Interested buyers in the region can already pre-order the Switch 2 version on the website. </p>



<p>Back in November 2025, the Take Two CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-sales-results-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the launch sales numbers for Borderlands 4 were&nbsp;“a little softer” than they would’ve liked, but expects it to do well “in the fullness of time”. Hopefully, the Switch 2 launch can help increase these numbers significantly. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is the fourth instalment of the highly popular looter shooter series, which features billions of weapons, a variety of enemies, and exciting co-op gameplay. The latest instalment takes players to a brand-new planet called Kairos, which features 4 fresh Vault Hunters.

A final major content update for the Early Access build featuring <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,823 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> Sharing and various improvements is planned for this spring. <span id="more-1020281"></span></p><p><em>Enshrouded</em> first launched in Early Access for PC on January 24, 2024.</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Roadmap Goes Ever On and On</strong></p><p>On their development adventure, Keen Games has learned that the road is rarely as straightforward as a map suggests. However, any map is better than none, so the team has shared the first look at the evolving roadmap guiding them out of <em>Enshrouded</em>’s Early Access today. It includes the major content update scheduled for Q2 2026—the eighth overall—which will feature a wealth of gameplay improvements, including balancing, further combat improvements, polishing, and performance optimization. <em>Enshrouded</em> developers also confirm that the first iteration of Adventure Sharing, another highly-requested feature by the community, will be implemented in this update: allowing players to easily explore the bases of their fellow Flameborn.</p><p><em>—Roadmap</em></p><!-- AD: content -->

The breakout success of the game’s Early Access launch has allowed the team to execute and expand on <em>Enshrouded</em>’s original concept, making the second half of 2026 the ideal spot to realize the team’s vision. 1.0 Launch will not be the final destination, rather a new chapter for further development—improvements, additional content, and more. Without the support of over five million players, the journey would not have been possible. The team is again humbled and expresses their immense gratitude to the many Flameborn who have fanned the flames and stoked the fires through playing Enshrouded, providing feedback, and being a part of the community, also sharing some of the impressive gameplay stats they have acquired:</p><p>Before we fix our gazes too far down the road, the team shares details of a patch to be released tomorrow that includes the following improvements and fixes:</p><ul><li>Combat tweaks continue, modifying damage number visibility, blocking and parry animations / telegraphy, projectile spells / attack improvements in accuracy, and their related displays.</li><li>New vanity armor set: talk to the Huntress.</li><li>Randomly exploding barrels placed will explode less randomly (after applying the patch, if it does explode, know that it was probably your fault).</li><li>Fixed a lot of bugs, which should improve stability and performance.</li><li>Full patch notes will be shared on Steam when the patch is available.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new developer diary below.</p><h2><span>Road to Release</span></h2><p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Road to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/enshrouded-launches-this-fall-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re approaching the 2nd anniversary of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2023/07/13/surviving-made-easier">Enshrouded</a>’s early access launch on January 24, and developer Keen Games is marking the occasion by revealing the game’s 1.0 launch window. While we already knew the survival action RPG would exit early access this year, that timeframe has been narrowed to sometime this fall.</p><p>Until then, Keen Games has released a developer diary where it discusses plans for one last major content update for the early access build. While the details of this update are under wraps, Adventure Sharing, which lets players share creations with the community, will be one of the additions.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Enshrouded hits 1.0, new areas of the map will be unlocked, as will a more advanced version of Adventure Sharing. Building systems will also receive new features and improvements. Keen Games also promises to improve combat by adding more technical depth, better enemy behavior and variety, and reworked balancing. Keen will continue optimizing the game post-launch, specifically calling out shader compilation as one key area of improvement. Lastly, Enshrouded is coming to consoles upon launching in 1.0, though it does not specify platforms.</p><p>The team has also touched on Enshrouded’s evolving content roadmap for the year. While we don't get a fleshed-out schedule of confirmed updates, Keen does state that post-launch updates will include paid expansions as well as free content drops. &nbsp;Additionally, the game will receive a patch tomorrow that will add combat tweaks, such as modifying damage number visibility, adjusting blocking/parry animations and telegraphy, and improving projectile spells/attack accuracy. This patch will also introduce a new vanity armor set, make randomly exploding barrels do so less frequently, and include other bug fixes that players can read in the patch notes.</p><p>Enshrouded has been coming together for two years and has undergone significant changes since its Early Access release in 2024. Since then, it has garnered over five million players playing as Flameborn and fighting to uncover the remnants of the fallen and corrupted land of Embervale. It will be curious to see how big a splash Enshrouded makes once it launches in full, and players on PC and console can find out once autumn rolls around.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/enshrouded-goes-10-this-fall-as-keen-games-discusses-2026-content-roadmap]]></content:encoded>
