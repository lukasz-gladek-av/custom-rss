Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Niantic Labs has announced that it’s selling its video game division to Saudi Arabia-owned mobile developer Scopely for $3.5 billion after struggling to replicate the success of <em>Pokémon Go </em>across its other AR games. The newly inked agreement includes Niantic’s <em>Pokémon Go, Monster Hunter Now, </em>and<em> Pikmin Bloom</em> mobile gaming titles.</p><p>“Niantic games have always been a bridge to connect people and inspire exploration, and I am confident they will continue to do both as part of Scopely,” said Niantic CEO John Hanke. “I firmly believe this partnership is great for our players and is the best way to ensure that our games have the long-term support and investment needed to be ‘forever games’ that will endure for future generations.”</p><p>The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Should the deal go through, it will also bring Niantic’s social companion apps for <em>Pokémon Go</em> — Campfire and Wayfarer — under Scopely ownership. Scopely says it will gain “Niantic’s entire team of exceptional gamemakers and category-leading games.” However, the <em>Peridot</em> and <em>Ingress</em> AR gaming titles, the latter of which is also supported by the Wayfarer mapping app, will remain under the ownership and development of Niantic Spatial.</p><p><em>Pokémon Go</em> attracted more than 500 million players in its first year, but its popularity was impacted in 2020 when global covid lockdowns kept people inside their homes. The company has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23188812/niantic-layoffs-canceling-projects-transformers">canceled multiple projects</a> and <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/organizational-update?hl=en">laid off at least 310 employees</a> between 2022-2023 in an attempt to “weather the current challenges in the market.”</p><p>Today’s announcement is Saudi Arabia’s latest attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">muscle its way into the gaming industry</a>, having used its Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire stakes in Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, and EA. The PIF was also used to establish Esports and gaming company Savvy Games Group in 2021, which later acquired <em>Monopoly Go</em>! developer Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023.</p><p>The announcement appears to be the 2025 “megadeal” that Scopely’s chief revenue officer Tim O’Brien teased last year, saying during a Q&amp;A that it would involve “a scaled global franchise doing hopefully at least a billion dollars in revenue.” Niantic Labs doesn’t disclose its earnings to the public, but Scopely said in its announcement that Niantic’s gaming business drove $1 billion in revenue last year, and <em>Pokémon Go</em> alone is <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-go-catches-nearly-8-billion-in-eight-years/">estimated to have brought in $7.9 billion in revenue</a> since launching in 2016.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re talking expanded level caps, new game plus, a brand new difficulty level which grants new skills and weapons, and…weapon reforging. If you’re au fait with <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>and its innumerable spinoffs, weapon reforging should look pretty familiar: If you have two copies of the same weapon, you can merge them to either mix-and-match skills or wholesale increase a weapon’s strength. Do this enough times, and you can theoretically get a +99 weapon with insane attack power. Neat, right? Well…</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I come to you today as someone who has mastered every nook and cranny of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>. With my shiny platinum trophy under my belt, I have conquered all the challenges, seen every sight, and felled entire armies by myself. And throughout all of that, not only did I never need reforged weapons to overcome any postgame challenges, I almost made an otherwise easy-to-get trophy way harder on myself. Here’s the breakdown.</p><h2 id="h28106"><a id=""></a><strong>Why weapon reforging is awesome…in theory</strong></h2><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>weapon reforging <em>technically</em> offers you the best weapons in the game</strong>. As you progress into the endgame, you can find weapons as high as Grade 7 as drops in battle. If you grind out enough Grade 7 weapons, you can merge them into an armament with a whopping 623 Attack stat and a slew of six passive skills of your own choosing. It’s those passives that are key here; normally weapons feature a mix of common and rare passive traits, but nothing’s stopping you from loading your weapon with all rare traits that will push your damage per second to the moon.</p><p>Nothing in the game will quite match the power of a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon. But you <em>will </em>find weapons that come awfully close, and therein lies the rub.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-recommend-id="image://4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Rampaging Luan weapon is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h28107"><a id=""></a><strong>Grade 8 Luan weapons are so much easier to get</strong></h2><p>Yes, while Grade 7 weapons are the best equipment you can find as drops, you can attain mythical Grade 8 “Luan” weapons by completing challenges on the postgame-exclusive Ultimate Warrior difficulty. Considering you can attain these weapons early in your postgame grind, they offer a huge jump in power. We’re talking attack power on par with a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon and a suite of six passive abilities that aren’t <em>great</em>, but are still perfectly acceptable for a non-forged weapon.</p><p>Luan weapons are all unique, so they can’t be upgraded or edited at all via weapon reforging. This is why a maxed out Grade 7 weapon can still outperform a Luan weapon in the end. But is the minor difference in power worth the massive difference in effort?</p><h2 id="h28108"><a id=""></a><strong>Why Luan weapons are better than Grade 7 weapons in practice</strong></h2><p><strong>Getting a maxed Grade 7 weapon involves a huge grind</strong>. For reference, even after completing <em>everything </em>in the game, I didn’t get a single Grade 7 weapon past +40 with the drops I naturally acquired. Conversely, many Luan weapons aren’t even locked behind especially hard postgame challenges. For example, the Lurking Luan sword is locked behind the “Final Battle against the Yellow Turbans” mission in Chapter 1, and I completed this challenge with time to spare even though I was several levels below the recommended level 71.</p><p>By the time I reached max level through naturally completing Ultimate Warrior missions, I had <em>ample </em>power to defeat anything and everything the game could throw at me. Taking the time to grind out maxed Grade 7 weapons would have been total overkill.</p><figure id="" data-id="7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-recommend-id="image://7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot of the Weapon Reforge menu from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Grade 7 weapon Celestial Sword +23 is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h28109"><a id=""></a><strong>The best way to get the Deadly Perfection achievement</strong></h2><p>Still, you don’t want to ignore weapon forging completely. The Deadly Perfection achievement is unlocked by fully upgrading a weapon, so you can’t miss this if you want 100 percent completion. Fortunately, as long as you’re not gunning for a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon, this one is pretty easy.</p><p><strong>To easily get Deadly Perfection, just save your game and spend all your money on upgrading any weapon Grade 6 or lower</strong>. Since you can find and outright purchase weapons with +20 modifiers already on them, this is significantly easier to grind out as long as you have the cash. In fact, a +99 Grade 6 weapon will perform about on par with a +13 Grade 7 weapon, so you could choose to use one if you’re starting Ultimate Warrior. But if you’d rather save your cash, you can reload your game after getting your trophy.</p><p>To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with wanting a fully upgrade Grade 7 weapon! If you’re down for the grind, it’ll certainly make the rest of your postgame challenge easier. But if you’d rather save your time, you’re not missing much.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-repo-cost-is-it-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>



<hr>



<p>Many indie titles enjoy a hot start, and the hype and excitement dip. But Among Us shows that a squirrel finds a nut (or a gun) from time to time. It’ll be fascinating to see if REPO can stand the test of time in 2025—do you hope it can sustain its success?</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has commented further on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023, stating: "I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with".</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html">Game*Spark</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideki-kamiya-wants-his-new-studio-to-inherit-the-teachings-of-resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami/">Automaton</a>), the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> creator discussed his new studio Clovers and disputed its similarity to Capcom's now-defunct Clover Studio (where he worked on Okami and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>) is not him "clinging to the past".</p>
<p>"If there's anything I'm particular about, it's Capcom Production Studio 4," he said. "Studio 4 is where my career started, and where I learned from Shinji Mikami - a person who has been absolutely indispensable to my career, both as a creator and as my superior."</p>

<p>Mikami led Production Studio 4, which was responsible for many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and many more.</p>
<p>"Back then, we used to call what Mikami taught us the 'spirit of the 4th'," said Kamiya. "The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company's way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn't place importance on the creators' individuality."</p>
<p>He added: "Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with."</p>
<p>Kamiya is a particularly outspoken figure in the games industry, but his output certainly has a unique and distinctive flair: from the stylish action of Devil May Cry and flamboyance of Bayonetta, to the unique visuals of Okami and Viewtiful Joe.</p>
<p>That spirit of "the creators' individuality" is also particularly apparent in, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">forthcoming Death Stranding 2</a>. Where the industry contains plenty of copycat games and sequels, Kamiya's comments highlight the importance of creating fresh experiences.</p>
<p>Another Kamiya example would be the cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, which Kamiya worked on at PlatinumGames with Microsoft. The action game focused on a human protagonist with headphones and a smartphone in a fantasy world with a sidekick dragon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-resurrect-the-cancelled-scalebound">Kamiya recently stated his interest in resurrecting the project</a>, with a direct callout to Xbox boss Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Kamiya also took a cheeky stab at his former employer in a video on his YouTube channel. It features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-loses-more-game-directors-reveals-former-vice-president-hideki-kamiya">number of prominent developers from PlatinumGames who have recently left</a> all having a drinking party.</p>
<p>Clovers, Kamiya's new studio, is working on a sequel to Okami. The announcement had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">Kamiya "crying with the fans"</a>.</p>
<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">working with Microsoft on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microtransactions have been added to EA's free-to-play Skate revival during the game's closed alpha test.</p>
<p>Skate's in-game currency is known as San Van Bucks, and allows players to buy various cosmetic items. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/">Insider Gaming</a>, developer Full Circle said this is being added to give players a "positive experience when purchasing items from the Skate store".</p>

<p>A message to Skate's playtesters reads: "To ensure we achieve these goals at Early Access we have enabled the option to purchase and use virtual currency (San Van Bucks) in our ongoing Closed Alpha playtest.</p>
<p>"Your feedback will be greatly appreciated in providing a great experience at Early Access launch."</p>
<p>The developer has told players that any purchases made during the test will be converted back to San Van Bucks prior to the game's early access launch. The currency will be made available again at the start of Skate's early access, but players must ensure they use the same EA account.</p>

<p>Emeri Chase, who played Soldier 11, announced they were replaced as they were "unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protections".</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has also been recast despite not being a member of the union.

<p>Chase posted a thread on social media to explain the situation.</p>
<p>"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," they said. "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck'. But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p>
<p>"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the Union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love.</p>
<p>"I knew that by withholding work it was possible I'd be replaced, though of course I hoped they would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return. I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you."</p>

I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry.

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has contacted HoYoverse for further comment.</p>
<p>Today, Eurogamer reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">strike from US actors' union SAG-AFTRA remains ongoing</a> as it warns of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse" in the latest proposal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike began back in July last year</a>, with the main sticking point being the need to protect actors from AI abuse.</p>
<p>While some actors are still working despite the strike, Chase and Thurkettle's situation is a clear example of the risk actors are taking to protect their livelihoods as the dispute continues.</p>
<p>Today the union urged performers to "seriously consider the consequences" of working with game producers at this time, not only in undermining the strike but opening performers to AI misuse.</p>
<p>In related news, HoYoverse announced actor Showtaro Morikubo will no longer voice Ifa in the Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Genshin_7/status/1899664144800080249">social media announcement</a>, the company stated "due to various circumstances" the actors has "been forced to withdraw from the project".</p>
<p>While no further details have been given, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/genshin-impact-ifa-japanese-voice-actor-suddenly-changed-fans-speculate-that-the-reason-is-political/">Automaton</a> reports fans are speculating it may be due to Morikubo appearing in a live reading back in 2024 called Inochigake no Shougen (Life-risking Testimonies), based on a book of the same name which contains testimonies of Uyghur people. The book likens the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghur to the suppression and genocide of Jewish people by the Nazi party.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Netflix's first gaming boss has left the company, following a shift in role and various changes behind the scenes last year.
</p>
<p>
Mike Verdu launched and led Netflix's gaming efforts in 2021, but was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">moved to a new role - VP of Generative AI for games at Netflix</a> - in November last year. At the time, Verdu said peers should "pay no mind to uninformed speculation in the media about changes at Netflix Games", as the changes were a "planned transition".
</p>
<p>
Now, Verdu has departed the company entirely, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">Game File</a> has reported.
</p>
<p>
The move follows a number of shifts behind the scenes last year, including the hiring of gaming industry veteran Alain Tascan to serve as Verdu's replacement as gaming boss.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten, and scrapped its big-budget project before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
By January, <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Netflix had reportedly dropped at least six other game projects</a> it was planning to publish - including cosy Hobbit sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which will now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-yet-again">launch at a later date without the streaming company's involvement</a>.
</p>
<p>
And in February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Netflix cut staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>. No announcement was made on how many jobs were lost, or what the studio was working on next.
</p>
<p>
As Netflix reorganises its plans, it remains unclear how its gaming focus will look going forward - other than Verdu will not be part of it.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">increasing its prices yet again</a>, including here in the UK.

"Management did not inform public about these steps either," Krúpa claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?srnd=undefined" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were in discussions to take the company private following a number of high-profile flops, game cancellations, and the collapse of the company's share price. At the time, the talks were merely exploratory, and Ubisoft told IGN it would "inform the market if and when appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For several years now, Ubisoft has seemed to be in a strange, slow downward spiral, with a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">high-profile flops</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">layoffs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">studio closures</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">game cancellations, and delay after delay after delay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, rumors continue to spin about what exact proposals the board is considering, with some media outlets floating the idea that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tencent is increasingly reluctant to embrace Ubisoft</a> due to the Guillemot family's insistance on retaining a significant amount of control. Sans Tencent, there are few other companies big enough and rich enough to spend the cash needed to save the albatross Ubisoft has grown into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Management postponed its current game (which should save the company and its financials) Assassin’s Creed first time on 18th of July 2024," Krúpa's statement said. "On that date, Ubisoft confirmed full-year guidance for the year and release of AC Shadows on November 15. 2024. Just [a] couple months later, in September 2024, Ubisoft delayed the game again and revised its guidance, which in our view, was [a] move that could have [been] predicted by Ubisoft management. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After [the] third delay, the game will finally be published on March 20, 2025. These delays and revised guidances caused severe stock declines, which harmed mostly retail investors that have limited resources to manage their positions accordingly. This action benefited mainly corporate and institutional investors who were on the buy side for distressed prices such as Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs clients, Morgan Stanley, and others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believing management did not communicate with shareholders "appropriately," AJ Investments is calling on all investors "who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft's stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team" to join its protest in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are aware that Ubisoft’s management and CEO have initiated a financial review of potential strategic options, advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. We expect this review to yield results in the coming months,” said Juraj Krúpa, founder of AJ Investments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why we are organizing this demonstration in May — to ensure they have time to reach a conclusion that genuinely increases shareholder value. If their conclusion effectively enhances shareholder value, we will call off the demonstration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All shareholders/investors of Ubisoft deserve a company that maximizes value and operates with transparency and accountability,” Krúpa added. “Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AJ Investors said that it is prepared to "sue the company for misleading investors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time this investor has called for the company to go private amid a shares slump following the disappointing release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump"><u>AJ Investments issued a strongly worded open letter to Ubisoft’s board of directors</u></a>, including its CEO Yves Guillemot, as well as fellow investor Tencent, to express their dissatisfaction with the performance of the company and its current share price and urging the firm to change its leadership and consider a sale. It followed weeks of turmoil at Ubisoft, where the megacorp's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales"><u>share price plunged following the launch of Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>, which Ubisoft subsequently confirmed had performed below expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <p>
Lego is working to build up its in-house game development, the company's boss has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf">The Financial Times</a>, Lego boss Niels Christiansen said the company was increasing its focus on video game experiences created by its own teams, following years of partnerships with outside companies. 
</p>
<p>
"We can definitely say, as long as we're under the Lego brand, we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical," Christiansen said. "[In-house game development] is something we're building up. We have made quite a few investments in the future – I'd almost rather overinvest. That's the benefit of being family-owned and long term."
</p>
<p>
For over a decade, Lego games were mostly made by British studio TT Games, with a popular tie-in to a big movie franchise released every year.
</p>
<p>
For 15 years, TT Games pumped out dozens of annual Lego games with a familiar formula, based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC characters. It also mounted the ambitious toys-to-life effort <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But that era of Lego gaming is largely over, with only one entry - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> - in the past six years. TT Games is reportedly still working on a further title, but it is not expected in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Lego has licensed its brand to a wider set of developers - most notably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, co-developed by Guerilla Games and published by Sony. Fortnite now has a deep integration with Lego, with minifigure versions of most of its digital skins, two large Lego game modes, and countless mini-games made by Lego itself and fans.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, now rebranded to Lego Fortnite Odyssey, is a Minecraft-y offering regularly played by around 50,000 people concurrently within the main Fortnite client. Last December, the company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">launched Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, a gentle life sim and house decoration game, to a smaller audience.
</p>
<p>
For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-lego-horror-cheerful-games-and-others-we-just-cant-get-into">The Lego Group has a small team of designers building and launching game concepts within Fortnite</a>, which now has an impressive replication of Lego bricks and physics baked into Epic's Unreal Engine. It'll be interesting to see what's next, as the wait for TT Games' next old-school Lego game continues.
</p>
<p>"I hope it will never be done," head of Lego gaming at The Lego Group Remi Marcelli told Eurogamer last year, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-lego-fortnite-i-hope-it-will-never-be-done">the company's big Fortnite mode, which continues to expand</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With just about two weeks before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a>, UK developer Rebellion has shared the minimum system requirements needed to play the game's PC version. They're not too different from what we see nowadays, though the good news is that the game (powered as usual by Rebellion's proprietary Asura engine) won't occupy too much space on your drive.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 or later</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel CPU Core i5-9400f or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia 2060 6GB or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;60 GB available space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a fresh features trailer out today, too, and you can watch it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Features Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k1QT6gM5wY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is being labeled as Rebellion's take on Fallout, although it is more of a survival action game than a roleplaying game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic British countryside landscape heavily inspired by the real-life Windscale Fire disaster of the 1950s in England, unfolding in a quarantined environment where players must uncover the mysteries of a nuclear disaster while surviving in a militarized zone. The setting includes inspirations from the likes of Doctor Who and even folk horror.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Atomfall will let players explore a non-linear world filled with complex characters and ambiguous moral dilemmas. The story will also change depending on the player's decisions. This design was crafted to encourage multiple playthroughs, with players experiencing different facets of the game based on their choices.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself won't be about running and gunning. Players will have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out of the quarantined zone. Weapons and ammunition are in short supply, so each frenetic battle will see them forced to mix ranged with hand-to-hand combat. In a nod to Rebellion's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-resistance-sniping-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite series</a>, players will have to manage their character's heart rate to maintain a steady aim.</p>
<p>Atomfall will launch on March 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though the Deluxe Edition provides three days of early access as well as a few in-game items and access to an upcoming expansion. The game will be available on release day for all Game Pass subscribers.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Hazelight Studios <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that their latest game, Split Fiction, has already sold over a million copies in just two days since its debut on the market. The immense popularity of the studio's previous release, the award-winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> (which sold 23 million copies, over twice as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Way Out</a>'s 11 million units), certainly contributed to the great hype surrounding the latest co-op adventure crafted by Josef Fares and his team.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/Hazelight+Studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam figures</a>. While A Way Out peaked at just 8.5K concurrent users and It Takes Two reached 71K concurrent users, Split Fiction registered 259K concurrent users three days ago, with the potential to set a new record this coming weekend.</p>
<p>The game also got a warm reception from critics overall, as evidenced by the 91 average Metacritic score. Our Nathan Birch was slightly less enthusiastic about it, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving it an 8 out of 10 score</a>.</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Are you enjoying Hazelight's new game so far?</p>
<p>In other news, Josef Fares recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his opinion</a> on the damage that the microtransaction business model deals to developer creativity.</p>

            <p>
Three top Ubisoft employees have appeared in a French court, accused of harassing employees before their departure from the company almost five years ago.
</p>
<p>
The trio includes Serge Hascoet, Ubisoft's previous chief creative officer and right-hand man to company boss Yves Guillemot, plus the former VP of editorial and creative services Tommy Francois, and Guillaume Patrux, a game designer and director.
</p>
<p>
All three deny sexually and psychologically harassing and humiliating employees during their tenures at the company, up until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">they resigned or were dismissed in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details discussed during the court appearance this week (thanks, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250310-former-ubisoft-bosses-on-trial-in-france-over-alleged-harassment-1">France24</a>) include accusations of racist comments and behaviour by Hascoet, who allegedly asked a Muslim employee if she agreed with the Islamic State terrorist group in the wake of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. It's alleged that the same staff member had their computer desktop wallpaper changed to that of bacon, and had food placed on their desk during the fasting month of Ramadan.
</p>
<p>
A string of allegations concerning Francois includes him having regularly watched porn in the company's open-plan office, kissing colleagues, and remarking on their appearance by calling them "ugly" or a "slut". Francois specifically is accused of sexual assault for allegedly forcing himself on a young employee during a Christmas party. He also allegedly forced a young employee to perform a headstand while wearing a skirt.
</p>
<p>
Patrux, meanwhile, stands accused of psychological harassment.
</p>
<p>
The trial has now been adjourned until 2nd June after lawyers complained they had not been given long enough with the case's documentation.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

			<p>During a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wicked Inside</a>, Moon Studios revealed major news about its in-development action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a>. Arguably the most important tidbit is that the Austrian developer has secured the game's publishing rights back from Private Division, after several months of legal negotiations. This will allow the studio to be fully independent when making decisions about the title. To celebrate the occurrence, there's a 30% discount valid for another 32 hours or so.</p>
<p>Moon Studios then moved on to share details about the next big update, The Breach, out on April 30. This update will expand the campaign and introduce new areas, armors, factions, enemies, and weapons, roughly doubling the world size. The new areas include the Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, while players will encounter new foes known as the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</p>
<p>The Breach will add new weapon archetypes (gauntlets &amp; wands) to No Rest for the Wicked and an updated loot system for more build variety. Furthermore, the game world is getting more dynamic thanks to the 'Alive' system, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape it. The Plague system will also unleashe powerful new plague enemies and bosses. Plague outbreaks now occur throughout Sacra, and players can cleanse these regions to gain powerful new plague resources.</p>
<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are also included, such as the ability to teleport directly to your home, improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, timer improvements, and a redesigned storage system. Additionally, there's now a Hardcore mode, and visual and performance have been enhanced and optimized with improved lighting and NVIDIA DLSS implementation.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After The Breach, the following big update will introduce multiplayer for up to four players. A preview of that is coming soon. The developer is also planning further expansions to the city, housing, farming, and progression systems, as well as further refinements to combat. Lastly, the celebrated composer of the Ori series, Gareth Coker, has rejoined Moon Studios and will contribute new music to No Rest for the Wicked.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Francesco De Meo's early access hands-on preview</a>, the game has a lot of potential, although the developers clearly still need some time to realize it. The full game has no release date yet.</p>

            <p>“While GTA lets players experience a fictional underworld of lawless enterprise, the entities behind PlayerAuctions own and operate a real one". So claims a lawyer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands </a>publisher Take-Two Interactive in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon">complaint filed on Tuesday</a> against third-party asset marketplace PlayerAuctions. They accuse PlayerAuctions - who have already faced similar accusations from Roblox - of selling modified player accounts obtained by hacking, via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>(I have no choice but to respect the hustle of trying to make GTA's "fictional underworld of lawless enterprise" sound as cool as possible during a lawsuit. "While GTA lets players do cool and fun <strong>fake</strong> crimes...")</p>
<p>"The website PlayerAuctions.com offers a vast online marketplace containing thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA V content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits,” continues the complaint.</p>

<p>As Polygon note, selling a GTA Online account to another player is not strictly illegal, though it's against terms of service. It's this alleged infringement, alongside copyright and trademark infringement claims, that comprise the complaint.</p>
<p>By offering account boosting, modded accounts, and currency drops, Take Two claim that PlayAuctions offers "an otherwise impossible experience: new players can begin GTA V with billions in VC and with a massive arsenal of in-game content—such as vehicles, clothing, and weapons—configurations only possible by hacking and modifying the GTA V game in breach of the Rockstar TOS."</p>
<p>"In some cases, these listings advertise 'unlock all' accounts preloaded with maxed-out character levels and virtually all in-game assets available to acquire in GTA Online," they continue. "Moreover, users buying Account Boosting Services give control of their GTA V account temporarily to an unknown third party – in violation of the Rockstar TOS – and disclose their GTA V account information, including passwords". PlayerAuctions take "at least 12.99% in fees," write Polygon, and the lawsuit claims that this amounts to "many tens of millions or even upwards of 100 million dollars."</p>
<p>“At the scale of its website," say Take-Two, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA V player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game. PlayerAuctions’ business also actively promotes behavior that risks creating a ‘race for the bottom’ where innocent GTA V players feel pressured to buy unauthorized digital goods and service, or else resort to using hacks or cheating themselves, to ‘keep up’ with PlayerAuctions’ customers."</p>
<p>A cynic might offer a translation to the above along the lines of "won't somebody please think of the innocent Shark Cards". Not me though. I look at GTA V's <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96595/grand-theft-auto-franchise-revenues-break-8-9-billion-since-gta-vs-launch/index.html">reported £6.9 billion revenue since release</a> and think, now that's just some good honest videogame sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520139/roblox-lawsuit-playerauctions-trading">Roblox sued PlayerAuctions for similar claims</a> last month, report Polygon. Take-Two's latest gift to innocent GTA V players is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5s-free-enhanced-update-spoiled-by-missing-in-game-text-chat-but-it-may-only-be-temporary">reportedly somewhat borked</a> GTA V Enhanced Edition.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "news that will get you banished from society if you try to explain it to anyone who doesn't live on the internet," the owner of an erotic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> subreddit has had their moderator status revoked from the main subreddit after a brief civil war surrounding AI generated art culminated with developer LocalThunk intervening. Cheers to <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a> for the spot.</p>
<p>Many threads lie dead and buried in the bloody wake of all this, but the brief rundown is that moderator DrTankHead - who also runs r/balatromance - waded into the following thread:</p>

<p>"Is it too much to ask to have a fun subreddit about a fun game that isn't being held hostage by a horny pro-AI weirdo?...that is too much to ask, isn't it," wrote user cherrycokeicee in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7l3e8/this_subreddit_is_doomed/">now locked thread</a>. Much banana flinging ensued, until Localthunk eventually had to get involved themselves.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art. This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (A Playstack representative told me this) but from a interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art"> they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds," Localthunk continued. "The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team. We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon."</p>
<p>The sub's rules do indeed now say "No AI generated art or content" underneath the "No low-effort posts/No spam" section.</p>
<p>After having their mod status removed, DrTankHead <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatromance/comments/1j82g1w/addressing_the_main_subs_ai_art_ban/">posted in r/balatroromance</a>, which he hopes will now offer a similar haven for AI art as it historically has for horny posting.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-5-enhanced-is-now-the-worst-rated-grand-theft-auto-title-on-steam.1132005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been a few days since Rockstar Games released GTA 5 Enhanced on PC, bringing a slew of changes and upgrades to the title and allowing players to migrate from the ‘standard’ version of Grand Theft Auto 5. However, things haven’t gone swimmingly, with the game’s overall review score on Steam bombing to an all-time low.</p>



<p>It’s now the worst-rated GTA title on the platform, with almost 10,000 reviews bearing a negative sentiment. It has garnered mixed feedback that’s <strong>mostly </strong>positive, but only just, with 53% of reviews saying something good about the release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-what-we-wanted">Not What We Wanted</h2>



<p>The biggest gripe players have with GTA 5 Enhanced on Steam is that the account migration feature is hit and miss. Many have reported in their reviews that they’ve been unsuccessful in migrating their accounts, which some have poured thousands of hours (and dollars) into over the years.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One review in particular</a> shines at echoing this sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time.” If you think i’m throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean. – MrMorganfarts</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eloquently put.</p>



<p>Another user explained that Rockstar has removed online chat, which has made lobbies and missions feel <strong>dead</strong>, while many more have said that GTA 5 Enhanced should have been an update applied to the base game and not an entirely new version.</p>



<p>The positive reviews, which were still in the close majority at the time of writing, say nice things about the upgraded visuals, the quality-of-life improvements, and the reduction in stuttering and frame rate issues.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped GTA 5 from being the worst-rated Grand Theft Auto title on Steam, though. It’s not close, either – it’s leading in that position by a good 10%. </p>



<p>Have you ‘upgraded’ to GTA 5 Enhanced and experienced issues? Let me know what you’re struggling with in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite leaker HYPEX’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1899497216546410966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the upcoming Fortnite x Kendrick Lamar collaboration. The partnership will seemingly introduce a “Sit Down, Be Humble” bundle with an emote and song. The song will most likely be “Humble,” the Grammy-winning song by the American Rapper, which was released in 2017. The tweet also states that the “Emote might be from the girl in “Not Like Us. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players will be excited to see Kendrick Lamar-inspired emotes arriving in the game. Some have also started speculating that the hip-hop artist could be a part of the next Fortnite Festival season. Others also wonder why Fortnite is going with a 2017 song when Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ blew out of the stratosphere after his Super Bowl performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, previous leaks have already provided an idea about who Fortnite Festival’s next headliner will be, and it doesn’t seem like it is Kendrick Lamar. According to the leaks that arrived in January this year, the next artist could be none other than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. The ‘Espresso’ singer is speculated to be the next Fortnite Festival Icon, which will bring new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is expected to introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-a-new-lara-croft-skin-this-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Lara Croft skin</a> in this update. Also, cheaters with lifetime bans will receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second chance</a>’ soon. What are your thoughts on Fortnite getting a Kendrick Lamar emote?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Take-Two, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has sued PlayerAuctions, a side that allegedly facilitates the sale of hacked and boosted GTA Online accounts and illegitimate in-game currency. The recent lawsuit was filed in California, with Take-Two claiming that the Chinese-owned PlayerAuctions platform was ‘reaping millions in revenue’ based on these sales.</p>



<p>The filing from the U.S. Central District Court of California insists that PlayerAuctions is being run with the ‘full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first">Not The First</h2>



<p>It was revealed in February 2025 that the Roblox Corporation was also suing PlayerAuctions for a similar streak of allegations. As these cases ramp up, more developers and publishers may enter the fight, as PlayerAuctions supports the sale of digital goods and services from a staggering assortment of titles.</p>



<p>Everything from RuneScape and Fortnite to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty is featured on PlayerAuctions.</p>



<p>The Take-Two case, which was originally spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, offers an in-depth perspective on how PlayerAuctions operates and how it’s walking a fine legal line when it comes to digital goods in GTA Online.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California court filing</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PlayerAuctions goes to great lengths to lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers, including by offering ‘after-sale protection’ – i.e. refunds – if the hacked accounts they purchase are detected and banned by Take-Two’s anti-cheat systems.</p>



<p>PlayerAuctions offers this ‘protection’ because it knows the hacked player account listings on its marketplace are infringing and unauthorised under Take-Two’s terms of service.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed in the filing that Take-Two has sent several notices to PlayerAuctions along with evidence of these claims, but the platform’s operators have refused to relent. Per the statutory claims of the case, Take-Two would be entitled to $150,000 for each copyright infringed, but PlayerAuctions’ sales figures haven’t yet been made public.</p>



<p>It could be a monster case in terms of damages if Take-Two is successful.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iron-man-motive-reference-gdc-removed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gdc-remove-%E2%80%98iron-man%E2%80%99-reference-from-electronic-arts-schedule-page.1131984/</guid>

<p>Just a couple of days ago, I reported on a mention of Motive’s Iron Man being shown during a summit at GDC next week. Eagle-eyed gamers spotted this, and it set up assumptions that the game would be demo-ready for GDC, one of the biggest conferences in the gaming world.</p>



<p>Now, it has been noticed that the GDC admin team has removed the reference to Iron Man from the same schedule page, suggesting that the game either will no longer be shown <strong>or </strong>the team is attempting to ‘keep it a surprise.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iron-man-no-more">Iron Man No More</h2>



<p>The schedule page promoting the Advanced Graphics Summit at GDC on March 17 originally spoke of a presentation concerning the development of texture sets for <strong>both </strong>Dead Space and Iron Man at EA’s Motive studio. This was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-iron-man-game-demo-ready-gdc/">covered in an article I published</a> recently, but upon refreshing the page, it’s clear that the Iron Man reference has been removed.</p>



<p>Whether this was an editing mistake or something that shouldn’t have been revealed yet remains to be seen. In just a few days, GDC will kick off in San Francisco, and journalists will attend the summit to determine the truth of it.</p>



<p>Motive has been working on an Iron Man game since at least 2022, when we revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">playtests for the title</a> had already started. It has been relatively silent in terms of production updates since it was revealed, and even base imagery of the game hasn’t been revealed.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a great time for superhero games of late, what with the collapse of Wonder Woman and the commercial failure of Suicide Squad, but that’s a problem for WB Games.</p>



<p>All we know so far is that Motive’s Iron Man will be a third-person, single-player title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/iron-man-unreal-engine-5/">built in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>Are you interested in picking up Iron Man when it eventually materialises? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>EA has officially added microtransactions to Skate’s latest alpha. In an update message sent out to players, EA teased an “epic gameplay update” along with other “exciting” updates to the game. </p>



<p>One of those updates from developer Full Circle is the addition of microtransactions to the current Closed Alpha playtest. This, according to a message sent to players that has been provided to Insider Gaming. </p>



<p>Known as San Van Bucks, this in-game currency allows players to buy various cosmetic items. According to Full Circle, this is being added to make sure players have a “positive experience when purchasing items from the skate store.”</p>



<p>“To ensure we achieve these goals at Early Access we have enabled the option to purchase and use virtual currency (San Van Bucks) in our ongoing Closed Alpha playtest,” the message to players reads. “Your feedback will be greatly appreciated in providing a great experience at Early Access launch.”</p>



<p>Because the game is still in a playtesting state, it’s mentioned that account progress might be reset at times and will be fully reset before the launch into Early Access. Should you spend any money on San Van Bucks—and, in turn, on items—any purchases you make will be converted back to San Van Bucks and be made available again at the start of Early Access.</p>



<p>To make sure you get them, though, you have to use the same EA account for both playtesting and Early Access.</p>



<p>EA Skate is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. When it does, the game will be free-to-play on PC and console. The game is also expected to come to mobile.</p>
