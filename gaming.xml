            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Assassin's Creed live-action TV series has been officially greenlit by Netflix, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4tiTYS8oDJ3ygEoJHIyrdQ/netflix-greenlights-assassins-creed-liveaction-series">confirmed</a> today.</p>



<p>The show, which will follow characters across pivotal historical events as they get involved in the sceret war between two faction, one determined to shape humanity's future through control, the other fighting to preserve free will, essentially running with the same premise of the video game series focused on the long way between the Assassins and the Templars, is the first series to be developed under the agreement signed back in 2020 between Ubisoft and Netflix to produce content based on the popular series. Emmy nominees Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing) are set as creators, showrunners, and executive producers of the newly announced show.</p>



<p><em>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us,"</em> said David Wiener and Rober Patino in a statement. <em>"Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</em></p>



<p>The latest entry in the Ubisoft series is Assassin's Creed Shadows. You can learn more about the solid open-world game set in Feudal Japan released earlier this year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-reportedly-trying-%E2%80%9Chail-mary%E2%80%9D-tactics-to-make-its-lawsuit-against-palworld-makers-stick.1246233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">confirmed it would be suing Pocketpair</a>, the studio behind last year's massive hit Palworld, many saw this as an inevitable outcome considering how litigious Nintendo is on a good day.</p>



<p>While the suit is still ongoing, and Pocketpair has already been forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">make changes to Palworld</a> based on the patents Nintendo is claiming Pocketpair is infringing on, a new report from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/">Gamefrays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nintendo-is-taking-desperate-measures-in-patent-infringement-case-against-palworld-and-its-looking-a-little-weird">Windows Central</a>) seems to show that Nintendo is doing everything and anything to make its suit against Pocketpair stick, even going so far as to change the patents it claims Pocketpair is infringing on, mid-suit. </p>



<p>Gamefrays does stipulate that changing a patent in the middle of an infringement suit isn't entirely unheard of, though it's usually done when the patent owner is concerned that its original patent will be found to have been invalid in the first place. It also doesn't necessarily mean that Nintendo is on the back foot or that it'll lose the case. Though, Gamefrays does point out that Nintendo's new language for the patent is awkward at best, which makes the change all the more weird.</p>



<p>Gamefrays calls out Nintendo's use of the phrases "<em>even when</em>" and "<em>even if</em>," neither of which is common when writing patents, nor are they clear to define in patent law. According to its report, Gamefrays calls the use of the word "<em>even</em>" and Nintendo's changes to the patents a "<em>Hail Mary</em>" move to try and secure a win for its suit in Japan. </p>



<p>Another unfortunate update on the lawsuit for Nintendo, is that it doesn't seem like it'll be able to bring a suit against Pocketpair in the US. The changes Pocketpair has already made, and the evidence Pocketpair is presenting around games with similar mechanics to Palworld that Nintendo has not gone after, all seem to be the immovable objects blocking Nintendo's path to suing Pocketpair in the US. Not that it won't keep trying, of course. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Netflix Live-Action Series Finally Moving Ahead]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-finally-moving-ahead.1246227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is finally moving forward at Netflix, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the series, which will be helmed by showrunners and co-creators Roberto Patino and David Wiener, has been given the green light, although there's no word of a release date or even a release window yet.</p>

<p>Patino says the goal with the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is to create "something undeniable for fans all over the planet", promising to highlight the franchise's focus on "people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith" underneath the "scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=BwAgjaLi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=So66-Csq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't yet know who the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>live-action series will focus on, but my money's on Ezio.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix scripted series VP Peter Friedlander, meanwhile, says the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is an "epic adventure" that will honor the franchise's legacy while also inviting "longtime fans and newcomers alike to experience the thrill of the Brotherhood as never before".</p>

<p>It isn't yet clear which of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s many time periods the show will focus on. According to its official logline, the show "follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny", so it's very possible we'll be seeing multiple historical periods, which would be interesting.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series focuses on just one period, though, my money's on Renaissance-era Italy and the story of Ezio, since he's probably the franchise's most popular protagonist.</p>

<p>Of course, given that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count" rel="nofollow">set a new Steam record for the franchise</a>&nbsp;and that sales for the modern action-RPG titles are strong across the board, we could well see&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow"><em>Origins</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a></em>,&nbsp;adapted instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=g5ER1Gok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=Fv7O9PNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla&nbsp;</em>serve as the basis for the upcoming live-action series?</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix series was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-in-development" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>, so presumably, it's essentially been stuck in something akin to development hell since then, although the series has obviously clawed its way out of that blighted land now.</p>

<p>It will find a landscape newly receptive towards streaming adaptations of gaming properties, with shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow">various other properties</a>&nbsp;making their way to streaming services in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether the series turns out better than the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassins-creed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">somewhat ambivalently-received</a> movie remains to be seen, and since we don't know when the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix show will air, it might be a while before we find out. Watch this space for more.</p>

Except the most important 30 milliseconds.” He goes on to say that remake developer Vicarious Visions “completely botched how jumping works.” That’s fighting words where I come from (Hillcrest, represent). But he’s got some numbers to back him up. Here’s his explanation of the difference between how jumping works in <em>Crash </em>1996 and the recent remakes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons–pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input [...] So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we’d subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input.</p></blockquote><p>He sums this up by saying “Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. [The game] intercepted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.”</p><p>This is the difference. But I’m kinda skeptical this morning, the 17th of July in the year of our lady 2025. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Andy Gavin for more details.</p><p>After some quick testing, I’m either missing some delicate nuance that I’d go so far as to say is negligible, or, Andy, I have to wonder if we’re playing the same remake? Check your LinkedIn messages, I’m curious about the specific differences in actual gameplay instances. </p><p>Granted, I tested things out on a PC with a Bluetooth Xbox controller using a backup of the original game’s image running in RetroArch with a Beetle PSX core. I then timed my jumps in each game to a metronome and jumped every “whole note” (I’m a musician, that’s how you’re going to get accurate timing from me). Some of you are probably freaking out: This is a horribly inaccurate way to drill down into the specifics of a 30-60 millisecond. Until I can devise a <em>Mythbusters</em>-grade testing unit complete with a robot that times a button press at an exact specified time (and then something that blows it all up), I can’t say for certain, but the jumps feel more similar than Gavin’s assertion that the remake only contains “maximum height” jumps. I mean, here’s another gif showing smaller jumps in motion on both games: </p><figure id="" data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Vicarious Visions / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m willing to believe that, obviously, there are minute technical differences between these two games, separated by decades of change in how video games are made. But also, as my colleague and <em>Kotaku</em> senior reporter Ethan Gach mentioned in our work Slack, <em>Mario</em> had different jump heights based on how long you held the button, so how unique is the <em>Crash </em>jump anyway? I also recently replayed these remakes. I and many other long-time <em>Crash</em> fans typically admit, this collection feels very accurate to the original 1990s-era experience.</p><p>I’ll get back to you if and when I learn more about <em>Crash</em>’s attempts to defy gravity.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482]]></content:encoded>

A crowdfunding campaign goes live next week, but a hands-on demo in the meantime shows just how bonkers this Android device is. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A first-look at the OneXSugar Sugar 1 was shared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/708283/toying-with-the-onexsugar-sugar-1-transforming-gaming-handheld&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/708283/toying-with-the-onexsugar-sugar-1-transforming-gaming-handheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with Sean Hollister at <em>The Verge</em></a></span>, who flipped it around at his garage work station like he was solving a portable gaming Rubik’s cube. There are two controller side panels, similar to a Nintendo Switch, but there’s also a second screen, similar to a Nintendo DS, and you can reconfigure them to achieve your preferred ergonomic layout and overload your multi-tasking gamer brain. Finally, you can scroll TikTok AND play games at the same time. </p><p>The Sugar 1 sports a 6.01-inch screen and a smaller 3.92-inch display and uses a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor for Android, cloud, and “retro gaming” (read: emulation). In addition to multitasking, the device is clearly aiming at players nostalgic for the days of the DS and 3DS, whose second-screen mechanics should be easily replicated given the form factor. It’ll be a pricey way to revisit, say, <em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em>, however. The Sugar 1 crowdfunding campaign goes live July 21, and Hollister suggests the device will cost north of $600. </p><p>That pushes the transforming handheld into PC gaming handheld territory. For instance, Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox Rog Ally device <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lzdtp2/rog_xbox_ally_prices_have_been_leaked_by_mistake/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lzdtp2/rog_xbox_ally_prices_have_been_leaked_by_mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is rumored</a></span> to start at $600, with the beefier Rog Ally X model coming in at closer to $1,000.

That one is just a screen with handles, though. No fancy hinges, sliders, or second screen. </p><p>The Sugar 1 might not end up being anywhere near the most practical gaming device when it finally comes to market, but it’ll no doubt be the most fun to fidget with. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/onexsugar-android-switch-ds-handheld-snapdragon-gen-3-1851786481]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, July 17, 2025. Below, we examine the ways the Paper Mario series has changed over the years, and how Origami King tried to recapture its early magic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Though Mario's platforming adventures are universally adored, the Paper Mario series has a much more mixed reputation. Its first two installments, Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64 and its GameCube sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, are widely regarded as Mario's finest role-playing outings, enchanting players with their imaginative storybook worlds and irreverent humor. As the series progressed, however, it gradually deviated from its RPG roots, shedding many of the elements that had made the first two games so beloved. While the series has never quite been the same since, its Switch installment, Paper Mario: The Origami King, is the only one that has come close to matching the heights of the original titles.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's identity crisis can be traced all the way back to 2007's Super Paper Mario. Originally announced for the Nintendo GameCube, this particular entry effectively began life as an offshoot of an offshoot--one last hurrah for the aging purple console spun out of repurposed assets and ideas from The Thousand-Year Door. By that point, however, GameCube sales had flatlined and a new generation was on the horizon, prompting Nintendo to move the title to the Wii, where it became many new players' introduction to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">As its moniker suggested, Super Paper Mario took a considerably different approach than its predecessors. Whereas previous games were turn-based RPGs with some platforming elements sprinkled in, Super Paper Mario inverted this formula; this entry was predominantly a platformer with some light RPG elements. Mario and company could still gain experience points for defeating enemies, which in turn increased their health, strength, and other attributes. But environments were largely laid out as side-scrolling stages, and the strategic, turn-based battle system of old Paper Mario games was gone; instead, players defeated foes by stomping on them in real time, a la the classic Super Mario Bros. games.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a stark departure from previous titles, though ultimately still an enjoyable one. Taken on its own, Super Paper Mario was a charming romp that retained the series' signature humor while contorting its gameplay in interesting ways. But it also signaled a shift in direction for the franchise, one that downplayed its role-playing qualities in favor of simpler stories and more immediate gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">This was borne out in the next installment, Paper Mario: Sticker Star for the 3DS. Although the game brought back turn-based combat, it removed party members entirely; this time, Mario faced off against foes solo, which completely changed the dynamic of battles. Moreover, many of the series' hallmark RPG elements were either streamlined or excised. Coins effectively doubled as currency and experience, while badges and Flower Points were replaced with stickers that were consumed upon use. It was a novel attempt at deconstructing RPG mechanics, but it further strayed from the elements that endeared the series to so many in the first place, and it would be largely dismissed by fans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665"></a><figcaption>Yes you are, little fella.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Part of this displeasure also owes to the game's unconventional structure. In an effort to tailor the adventure for a handheld system, Sticker Star divided up the interconnected world of previous Paper Mario games into a series of compact "levels," which were laid out across a world map like a traditional Mario platformer. These were generally roomier and more puzzle-oriented than the platforming stages of Super Paper Mario, but they made the world feel less convincing. Early Paper Mario games were so memorable because they whisked players through whimsical locales populated by unusual characters, which imbued each area with a distinct sense of place--something that Sticker Star's disjointed levels could never achieve.</p><p dir="ltr">Sticker Star's eventual followup, Paper Mario: Color Splash for the Wii U, refined some of its more divisive elements, making for an overall stronger game that was better received by fans. But it also retained a few of its predecessor's controversial qualities, namely its level-based structure and resource-centric battle system. The game was ultimately a step in the right direction, but it was nonetheless a vastly different experience from the series' earliest titles, which reinforced the perception that Paper Mario had changed permanently.</p><p dir="ltr">It's for these reasons that many fans greeted the announcement of Paper Mario: The Origami King with a mix of excitement and trepidation. As promising as the game initially appeared to be, the question of whether it would return to the series' roots or continue the divisive experiments of more recent Paper Mario games loomed over every marketing beat. The end result ultimately falls somewhere in the middle. While The Origami King still follows the action-adventure direction of its immediate predecessors, it also channels the spirit of earlier games with its vast setting and quirky cast, making it the series' best installment in over a decade--and a promising sign for Paper Mario's future.</p><p dir="ltr">This shift is immediately obvious in the game world. The Origami King eschews the level-based structure of Sticker Star and Color Splash for a large, interconnected setting--one that's much closer in scale and imagination to the first two Paper Mario games. Amid his travels, Mario visits a range of stunning and memorable environments, from the brilliant, red-and-orange papercraft foliage of Autumn Mountain to the opulent Shroom City--a gaudy oasis shining in the middle of a sprawling desert. Each area of the world is richly detailed and home to some hilarious denizens, which makes them feel much more like proper locales than the discrete stages of Sticker Star and Color Splash.</p><p dir="ltr">Crucially, Mario is also no longer traveling alone. The Origami King pairs the plumber up with a rotating cast of partner characters. While none of these companions quite match up to the beloved party members of the series' earliest titles (and are much more limited in battle), they add color to the world and a heartfelt touch to the story. The adorable Origami sprite Olivia is one of the series' more charming companions, playing a pivotal role in both combat and in moving the plot forward. Mario is also joined by several other characters at different points in the adventure, including an excitable Toad archeologist and even longtime nemesis Bowser, who spends much of the game helplessly folded up like a greeting card.</p><p dir="ltr">But most notable is Bobby, an amnesic Bob-omb who joins you during the game's second major chapter. Despite his nondescript appearance (unlike Bombette and Captain Bobbery from earlier titles, Bobby is just a standard-issue Bob-omb minion, albeit one curiously missing his fuse), Bobby quickly becomes one of the most memorable companions in the entire series thanks to his poignant character arc, which culminates in a genuinely shocking and moving scene. It's unexpected territory for a game about paper characters and office stationery to explore, which makes it all the more impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system, too, has once again been reimagined, and for the better. Moving away from the resource management of its two predecessors, The Origami King introduces a new panel-sliding system, which challenges players to rotate sections of the battle arena against a time limit and line up enemies for optimal damage. This makes every encounter feel like a rapid-fire micro-puzzle, and outside of the original turn-based battle system undergirding the first two Paper Mario games, it's the most thrilling battle system the series has yet devised.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain aspects of The Origami King still fall short of the series' best, but it's thanks to these elements that the game comes closer to recapturing Paper Mario's early magic than other recent installments. It remains to be seen if the series' next eventual title will follow in Origami King's footsteps or take inspiration from The Thousand-Year Door, which was also released on the Switch, in a lavishly remade form, in 2024. Whatever the future may hold, Paper Mario is in better shape than it's been in many years.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before Tony Hawk's Pro Skater shredded on to the video game scene in 1999, the man himself "had given up" on making a skateboarding game. Hawk revealed in a new interview that talks with various developers and console manufacturers about the concept were going nowhere in the mid- to late 1990s.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/07/17/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-remake-olympics/85205239007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, Hawk talked about how "it was kind of an uphill battle convincing anyone" to create a skateboarding game. He cited growing up on the medium as a reason for pursuing the idea, noting the Intellivision was the first console he owned. Later, Hawk had a Commodore 64, SNES, and then a PlayStation, and he also briefly did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTcDO0Ab2A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video-editing work for the TurboGrafx 16</a> in the early '90s. But with multiple companies passing on his idea, Hawk noted in 1997 that he basically had thrown in the towel.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Activision, however, was working on a skateboarding game and reportedly heard about Hawk's desire to make such a title. "And so I went to Activision," said Hawk. "I saw a very early build of what became THPS (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater), and immediately, I knew this was the game. I could tell instinctively that this would be the most fun, that this would be the best one to be involved with, and with my connections and resources and experience, we could make this something truly authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">The pairing ultimately led to one of the most beloved video game franchises of all time--one that just saw the remake launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. The series has spanned over two decades and a dozen games, with Hawk admitting that THPS games are what fans want to talk about when he meets them in public.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Hawk, he usually plays as himself in the games, though he does test out other skaters to check out their tricks. If he had to choose someone other than himself, "then I'm playing my son Riley," Hawk said.</p><p>Hawk is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-is-auctioning-his-gear-and-board-he-used-when-he-did-an-iconic-trick/1100-6532828/">auctioning off his skateboard that he rode for the first-ever officially recorded 900</a> performed, which happened in 1999--the same year the THPS franchise began. You can also see how Hawk has changed over the years in video game form with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-comparing-all-original-skaters-to-their-2000s-versions/2900-6761/#1">comparison of the skaters in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> from the original games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">which was first announced in 2020</a> - is finally moving forward.</p>
<p>The long-in-the-works adaptation based on Ubisoft's games is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show.</p>

<p>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007," Wiener and Patino told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a>. "Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith."</p>
<p>Continuing, the duo said Assassin's Creed is "about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance", but above all that "this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time" and "what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break".</p>
<p>Said Wiener and Patino: "We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny". That all sounds suitably Assassin's Creed-y.</p>
<p>In addition to Wiener and Patino, Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin and Austin Dill of Ubisoft Film and Television will serve as executive producers for the Assassin's Creed series along with Matt O'Toole.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to work alongside Roberto, David, and our Netflix partners to bring this beloved franchise to series," said Boykin. "We look forward to delivering an experience that speaks to the heart of what fans love about Assassin's Creed, while introducing its unforgettable worlds and timeless themes to new audiences worldwide."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series.

<p>"An all-new design that eliminates the risk of detachment entirely"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Dbrand Reveals &quot;Joy-Lock&quot; System To Deal With Killswitch Joy-Con &quot;Controversy&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585166eb74a62/dbrand-reveals-joy-lock-system-to-deal-with-killswitch-joy-con-controversy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/dbrand">Dbrand</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>A short time ago, Dbrand came under fire for design issues with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-case-teething-troubles-aside-this-case-is-killer">Killswitch Case for Switch 2</a> – in short, some users were finding that, with the case attached, the magnetic connection between the console and its Joy-Con 2 controllers was weakened, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-dbrands-switch-2-killswitch-dock-adapters-seamless-docking-apparently-isnt-quite-seamless">leading to them disengaging unintentionally</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Dbrand appeared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ljlvr9/nobody_holds_their_switch_2_like_this_dbrand/">dismiss the issue</a>, only to quickly apologise and promise to issue replacement parts that would solve the problem. It has now contacted its customers to clarify how it is dealing with the fault.</p>
<p>"A few weeks back, you may have seen articles floating around about a Killswitch controversy," says the company in an email seen by Nintendo Life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The extreme tl;dr version of this issue is that, when the Killswitch is held under very specific one-handed conditions, some Switch 2 Joy-Cons are unexpectedly detaching from the main console. This is due to a manufacturing tolerance issue on our original production run. Because the tolerance issue only affected a portion of stock, there’s a good chance you never noticed the issue at all. Whether you’ve experienced the issue or not, there’s no reliable way for us to determine which units were affected. As a result, we’re taking a cautious approach and simply replacing everyone’s Joy-Con Grips for free."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same email, the manufacturer insists it has gone one better by creating an "all-new design that eliminates the risk of detachment entirely" called 'Joy-Lock'.</p>
<p>Dbrand is also taking steps to address complaints levelled at its Dock Adapter, which ships alongside the Killswitch Case for Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In addition to feedback about the Joy-Con Grips, we’ve heard from customers that our Dock Adapter makes it difficult to un-dock the Switch 2 with one hand. As a result, users find themselves needing to hold the dock adapter down with one hand, while un-docking their Switch 2 with the other. To remedy this, all shipments of Joy-Lock Grips will also include a set of friction pads to apply to your Dock Adapter. These friction pads will make the Dock Adapter seat more snugly on the OEM dock, enabling one-handed undocking."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dbrand says it is "currently in the process of mass-producing about half a million sets of the new Joy-Lock Grips and a similar number of Dock Adapter friction pads," and that shipping is expected to take place in early August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Virtuos, the co-development team that is working with Konami to deliver Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the studio that just helped Bethesda develop The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">confirmed</a> what was previously rumored, that the studio has suffered mass layoffs, with nearly 280 staff impacted, or 7% of the company.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-metal-gear-solid-delta-virtuos-mass-layoffs-rumor/">Yesterday</a>, French journalist Gauthier Andres was the first to report the layoffs, along with claims from sources they spoke to about internal troubles at Virtous. Today, Virtuos confirmed the cuts, which, according to Virtuos, are slightly under the 300 number that Andres first reported. Virtuos did not comment on any alleged internal issues, and in its statement claimed that its "<em>immediate focus is on managing this transition with care, transparency, and respect</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry</em>," its statement began. "<em>As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This evolution involves a rebalancing of roles across our studios and geographies. Approximately 7% of Virtuos' global workforce was affected, primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts in the industry. This includes about 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe, including</em> <em>fewer than 10 in France, where the core team working on Oblivion Remastered is located</em>."</p>



<p>The statement goes on to explain why so many of the roles impacted are in its studios based in Asia, claiming the studio "<em>need[s] to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development.</em>"</p>



<p>As far as the other projects Virtuos has on the go, the studio says it "<em>remains fully committed to all our partnerships, including ongoing work on announced titles such as Oblivion Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>." </p>



<p> A key element of Andres' report from yesterday was how the studio's leadership is pushing to over-deliver in quality compared to the budget the studio is given. The Oblivion Remastered team was allegedly pushed to work harder despite Virtuos receiving no royalties on the game's sales, so that the studio could have Oblivion Remastered as a showpiece for the kind of work they are capable of.</p>



<p>That's the kind of strategy that can potentially lead to more contracts, but the only sure result a strategy like that can have is burning out the talent you're trying to show the studio has. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> didn’t make the best first impression, though I’m not talking about the game itself. The concept of a gritty reboot of <em>Pac-Man</em> first reared its strange head in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24313309/secret-level-review-amazon-prime-video"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, an anthology that turned notable video games into animated shorts that mostly felt like extended commercials. And that’s exactly what the episode “Circle,” which reimagined <em>Pac-Man</em> as a blood-soaked survival story, turned out to be. But as off-putting as the episode was, it turns out that the premise actually works for a <em>Metroid</em>-style action game.</p><p>For those who didn’t watch <em>Secret Level</em>, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> puts you in the role of an unnamed, hooded swordmaster, who awakens to find himself inside some sort of dark alien labyrinth. He’s greeted by a floating drone named Puck, who serves as both a guide and a partner to survive in this treacherous world. Puck, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICElL6dBsrQ">of course</a>, is Pac-Man.</p><p>For the most part, the game plays a lot like a typical Metroidvania. It’s a side-scrolling game that’s heavy on action, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, and as you defeat bosses and collect gold, you’ll slowly expand your arsenal of skills, which opens up the game further. The twisting, maze-like map is full of dead ends that you can’t explore until you get the right ability, which include staples like a double jump and grappling hook. You can also craft various upgrades, both permanent and temporary, so you can customize the character to your liking. It’s a satisfying loop of exploration, combat, and problem-solving (usually involving some kind of platforming sequence), punctuated by tense, elaborate boss fights that depend a lot on pattern memorization.</p><p>I could be describing a lot of other games here, but there are a few elements that make <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> unique. And it mostly has to do with Puck. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are rails that Puck can ride on, sort of like Pac-Man moving his way through a classic arcade maze. It’s reminiscent of Samus’ morph ball ability, except it’s relegated to predetermined areas of the map. Later on, there are actual <em>Pac-Man</em> mazes to play through, too, complete with pellets and ghosts to eat.</p><p>The game is at its best when you’re quickly swapping between Puck and the swordmaster, either to navigate a tricky platforming sequence or defeat enemies. In one early boss battle, I was able to use a rail on the ceiling to avoid projectiles, and then drop behind the enemy for some quick sneak attacks. Early on, Puck and the swordmaster gain the ability to temporarily fuse together to create a power-up that’s sort of like a mech suit, which you can use to devastate most enemies and even avoid environmental hazards. Oh, and when you’re a mech, you can eat your enemies to gain materials needed for those important unlocks.</p><p>One of the nice things about <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is that, unlike the animated short that preceded it, it doesn’t overdo it with the grim tone. It can get a little bloody when you’re slicing through creatures, but it’s not gratuitous. In fact, much like <em>Dread</em>, the oppressive tone creates an interesting kind of tension, one that makes the rare moments of respite feel especially welcome. That said, the cutscenes are self-serious and convoluted, and there are silly moments where Puck becomes giant and eats the corpses of bosses, but these are mostly easy to ignore if all you want to do is explore a complex map, <em>Metroid</em>-style.</p><p>That’s really what the game offers. The combat is solid, the platforming is challenging, and the bosses are exciting. And thankfully, the tone mostly doesn’t intrude on the experience, while the <em>Pac-Man</em> theme brings <em>just enough</em> new to add an interesting twist for those well-versed in Metroidvanias. <em>Secret Level</em> may have been a commercial, but it was a pretty poor one: it missed what actually makes <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> worth playing.</p><p><sub>Shadow Labyrinth <em>launches on July 18th on the PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/708833/shadow-labyrinth-review-gritty-pac-man]]></content:encoded>

It complements the store design, which takes fans through a journey (beach to boardwalk to nighttime).” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The theming Ruppenthal describes is important, as the Pokémon Center Pop Up Shop at the Pokémon World Championships each year isn’t just a plain holding room for goods, but more of an immersive experience to explore while shopping, complete with set pieces and unique art. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...this year, there will be a Pokémon Center special online-only shopping promotion taking place that same week.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, all of the Worlds merch revealed here would be exclusive to the in-person Pokémon Center,  which actually runs an additional two days ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championship, from August 13 to August 17. However,  this year, there will be a Pokémon Center special online-only shopping promotion taking place that same week. During this time, the 2025 Pokémon World Championships Coin will be available online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t know anything else about this online shopping event, like whether any other 2025 World Championship items will be available, but Ruppenthall said, “It’s our way of making sure more fans can take part in the celebration.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/map-of-worlds-2025-1752721631366.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A map of the Anaheim Worlds Event Hall, with a huge area in Hall D sectioned off for the Pokémon Center pop-up store. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are attending in person, keep in mind that you usually need to make a separate Pokémon Center pop-up store reservation, but right now, the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us/experience/pokemoncenter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anaheim 2025 Pokémon Center page</u></a> says, “More information on how to attend the Pokémon Center pop-up store is coming soon!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be sure to cover the Pokémon Center Pop Up Shop and a lot more during the 2025 Pokémon World Championships from August 15 to August 17 in Anaheim, so stay tuned for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor of guides at IGN.

These limbs can be looted, earned through trades, or taken from defeated enemies, offering plenty of ways to customize your loadout and playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatively led by film director Neill Blomkamp, writer and director of films <em>District 9, Elysium </em>and <em>Chappie, Off The Grid </em>has become “one of the most dynamic and responsive battle royales on the market” according to Gunzilla Games’ Executive Producer David Nicholson. Recent updates have been made to the game in direct response to community feedback, and it is that “commitment to player-driven development” that will help <em>Off The Grid </em>continue to build momentum as it prepares to roll out even more content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The launch of <em>Off The Grid </em>on PC opens the door to a larger and broader player base that can become part of the community and continue to improve the game through active engagement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been opening packs from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> for the past week, including a White Flare Elite Trainer Box, the Poster Collection, Black Bolt Binder Collection, the Victini Illustration Collection, and a White Flare Booster Bundle. Right away, these don’t feel like typical Scarlet and Violet products. This dual-set format means there are two completely separate card lists, with Black Bolt focusing on Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare leans into Reshiram, Samurott, and Keldeo. It’s a clean split that doesn’t feel like filler or overlap. It feels especially fresh considering we've had two sets of trainer Pokémon cards with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also the final expansion in the Scarlet and Violet era, and I can tell the designers knew it. Pulling cards from both sets, there’s just a lot more to look at and sort through. You’ve got Poké Ball reverse holos, Master Ball reverse holos, Illustration Rares, Special Illustration Rares, and the new Black White Rare cards. Every single Unovan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon</a> is included across the two sets, which was obvious the moment I started ripping packs, trying to keep track.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pxl-20250714-180207617-1752740669695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black White Rare cards</a> specifically caught my attention, although I didn't pull Reshiram, Zekrom or Victini. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt</a>, Zekrom ex has a new monochrome foil treatment, and in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-members-early-access-preorder-pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare">White Flare</a>, Reshiram ex has the same look but in pure white. These aren’t just normal secret rares with a different background (although they look fantastic too), They look completely different from anything in their respective sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I appreciate about this setup is how each set feels like it has its own identity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Black Bolt</a> leans into electric types and edgy designs, while White Flare has a lot more reds and fiery aesthetics. Even the packaging, from the ETBs to the mini tins, reflects that. Sorting the cards felt like two separate collections that just happened to release on the same day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pxl-20250714-180216169-1752740737783.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From a collector’s angle, there’s a lot going on here. I noticed pretty quickly that even commons have an Illustration Rare version somewhere in the set. For example, I pulled two different artwork versions of Patrat (one regular and one IR) and it wasn’t just alternate art slapped onto a foil. It felt intentional, with each version telling a different story. That kind of thing keeps me opening packs longer than I probably should.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that I had pretty consistent pulls across all the products I opened. Between the Poster Collection, the Binder Collection, and the Booster Bundle, I pulled several ex cards, a couple of Illustration Rares, and one Master Ball reverse holo that honestly looks better than I expected. It feels like The Pokémon Company made a conscious effort to avoid the rough pull experiences some of the smaller sets had earlier this year.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><p id="unboxing-and-impressions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unboxing and impressions">Unboxing and Impressions</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got my hands on an awesome selection of Black Bolt and White Flare products: a White Flare Elite Trainer Box, Unova Poster Collection, Black Bolt Binder Collection, the Victini Illustration Collection, and a White Flare Booster Bundle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt and White Flare - 1</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> I don’t always open this many different product types when previewing a set, but with the way this dual release is structured, The Pokémon Company wanted to show this large duel-set off. Both sets have their own exclusive promos and packaging styles, which made the whole thing feel like more than just pulling from the same booster packs over and over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-63-1752734995575.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I started with the White Flare ETB. Inside were the usual dice, sleeves, and nine booster packs. The promo is an epic Tornadus Illustration Rare. As for the pulls themselves, this ETB wasn’t the wildest I’ve opened, but I did manage to pull a Jellicent ex hyper rare, Whimsicott ex SIR, Accelfor IR, Keldeo ex, then a Mienfoo IR, Woobat Master Ball and Whimsicott ex in one pack! Epic result, but it’s ultimately potluck. Ripping packs of Black Bolt and White Flare open was certainly off to a cracking start.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Unova Poster Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-64-1752735168896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unova Poster Collection felt more like a side product. It’s not packed with boosters (just four) but it does come with promos of the Unovan starter common cards from the set and a fold-out poster showing Unova Pokémon featured in both sets on one side, then box art for Black Bolt and White Flare on the other. So there’s two Black Bolt and two White Flare boosters in the Poster Collection. I pulled a Jellicent ex, Venipede IR and a Kyurem ex, which isn’t bad at all for four pack openings.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Bolt Binder Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-65-1752735287443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Binder Collection includes five boosters plus a nine-pocket binder themed around either Black Bolt or White Flare, depending on which version you buy. I got the Black Bolt version and pulled a Drilbur IR, so not a great experience with Black Bolt from the binder collection but the extras will come in handy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Victini Illustration Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-66-1752735430293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of everything I opened, the Victini Illustration Collection was probably the most surprising. It comes with a Victini promo IR, a giant card of the same and a common Victini Pokéball, plus two Black Bolt and two White Flare. I managed to pull another Keldeo ex, Excadrill ex and a Amoonguss Masterball. The Victini promo’s are worth it on it’s own, but I got some half-decent pulls as well. Fantastic!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">White Flare Booster Bundle</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-67-1752735567011.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I went through a White Flare Booster Bundle. Six packs, no extra promos or sleeves. This one was all about straight pulls, of which I got one Whimsicott ex, a Patrat IR (my favorite pull of this preview) and Hilda Trainer Full Art in one pack, another Woobat Master Ball. The demi god pack energy in Black Bolt and White Flare is real, and it’s so cool to open one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really like Black Bolt and White Flare, with me leaning towards White Flare due to my personal luck with the set. If you’re not pulling IRs and Exs, you’re pulling Pokeball and Masterball rares. I think the ball rares are the new holo and reverse holos for Pokémon TCG, which is a win for everyone in my opinion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Bolt / White Flare: Top Card Pulls</h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt and White Flare - 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't argue with the amount of pulls from this preview. Out of 27 booster packs I managed to pull four ex's, three Master Ball rares, five Illustration Rares, one Hyper Rare and one Secret Illustration Rare. That's an overall pull rate of over 50%, which isn't bad at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have to consider this isn't a normal set thanks to the amount of Illustration rares and ball rares floating around, but it's an absolute blast to open. Although it's nice to see Pokéball and Master Ball rares coming back to English sets after Prismatic Evolutions, it feels like filling up an already packed set. It would be great to see how many epic pulls trainers could get without the inclusion of Pokéball and Masterball rares.</p><p id="my-favorite-pulls"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="My favorite pulls">My Favorite Black Bolt / White Flare Pulls</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Whimsicott ex Secret Art Rare</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/pixel-9-61-1752686302152.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was lucky enough to pull a Secret Art Rare version of Whimsicott ex, and as usual the artwork is fantastic.

Go figure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Meinfoo Illustration Rare</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-68-1752735782131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing that Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard ex 151 vibe, Mienfoo Illustration Rare is a cracking snapshot of a wild Pokémon.

It takes me right back to the launch of Black and White working at Gamestation in the UK (which was owned by Game at the time). We had an event cartridge in an old DS that allowed customers to unlock the Victini event and play through Black and White with this absolute gem of a Mythical Pokémon. Owning Pokémon cards with great memories like this attached to it like this is one of the many reasons why I'm into the TCG, and this artwork is gorgeous. 100% a big preview highlight for me.</p><p id="should-you-buy-these-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy these cards?">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt White Flare?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't secured preorders for Black Bolt and White Flare sealed products, feel free to try your luck at launch at your local brick and mortar or online.

</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do I think of the set? I think it's great and possibly the best opportunity to pull Illustration Rares in the Scarlet and Violet era, it's ending on a high note. Personally I'm not a fan of stuffing the set with Pokéball and Masterball rares, but in terms of quality and presentation they look cool. It would be grand to see Mega Evolution double down on the dual format and loads of Illustration Rares, but this is an encouraging sneek peek into what's next for Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>Video game industry veteran Julian LeFay, known by many as the "Father of The Elder Scrolls," is stepping away from the industry due to his ailing health.</p><p>LeFay co-founded the independent game developer OnceLost Games with other former Bethesda developers in 2019, and the team has been working on a new RPG called The Wayward Realms. LeFay has been fighting a battle with cancer for the past several years, producer Victor Villarreal said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwMyPR8Li6k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a>. "He has fought bravely and strongly, but it seems he doesn't have very much time left," he said.</p><p>Villarreal said LeFay has chosen to leave the game studio to spend time with his family and loved ones. He added that the studio had been preparing for LeFay to eventually leave the company, adding that LeFay made his "visions for the game" very clear to the studio. The team will "work tirelessly to bring that vision to life," Villarreal said.</p><p>OnceLost CEO Ted Peterson shared a statement about LeFay, speaking to their personal and professional lives together. Peterson said he met LeFay back in 1992 when he interviewed for a junior writer position at Bethesda. "I had never been in a game development company before, and when I left Julian said, 'If you get the job, you have to lose the suit.' Julian himself struck an eccentric figure. Very tall and slender, scruffily handsome with a default scowl, and the most magnificent pompadour mullet in history," Peterson said.</p><p>Peterson said LeFay is a big fan of pen-and-paper role-playing games, adding that what would eventually become The Elder Scrolls: Arena was "his dream project."</p><p>As for the new game Wayward Realms, Peterson said it began with a conversation he had with LeFay "several years ago" when LeFay was reflecting on the first Elder Scrolls games and how he might approach them differently today--with his decades of experience--while retaining the same core philosophies.</p><p>"Afterwards, we talked about what I would do with design and narrative given my own years of experience on other games and other media like TV, and we decided to give it a shot together," Peterson said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3XXGVCEhNI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3XXGVCEhNI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Peterson said LeFay has been "courageously battling cancer," but that his doctors are now saying "his time with us is limited," which is why he is stepping away.</p><p>"Julian must step away from OnceLost Games for his health and to live his final moments surrounded by his loved ones. Julian has complete faith in the ability of the team to bring the game he has envisioned to life for this incredible community," Peterson said. "Your words of support mean more than you know, not just to Julian, but to all of us who have been privileged to work alongside him. Obviously, the team has already had a chance to say goodbye and give their individual messages, and I sat by his hospital bed, reading them to him. In that case, I was reading them out loud and Julian was giving me dictation to reply back, which is rather hard to do through my tears."</p><p>LeFay has amassed <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/6760/julian-lefay/credits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">36 credits on 21 games</a>, including the first Elder Scrolls titles, Wayne Gretzky Hockey, The Terminator 2029, Dragon's Lair, and Where's Waldo. He left Bethesda in 1998.</p><p>A medieval fantasy RPG, The Wayward Realms is a spiritual successor to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall that aims to make use of "old-school" design philosophies combined with the newest technology thanks to Unreal Engine 5. The game is planned for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1685310/The_Wayward_Realms/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Early Access</a> but doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

            <p>
Silent Hill and Siren creator Keiichi Toyama has confirmed he and his team at Bokeh Game Studios is working it's next project, and it won't be a sequel to horror oddity Slitterhead.
</p>
<p>
Toyama shared the news in an <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/47230">interview with Famitsu</a> (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-is-already-working-on-his-next-game-and-its-not-a-slitterhead-sequel/">Automaton</a>). "I can't reveal the exact details," he explained, "but we have started working on our next title... Once again, we have to pour in all our efforts as a studio and prove that we are up to the task... However, we're still in the beginning phase, so I believe we'll be able to reveal more details [about the new project] somewhere in the future."
</p>
<p>
One thing the new game won't be, however, is a sequel to last year's Slitterhead. The idiosyncratic, horror-tinged action-adventure launched to a mixed critical reception, and Toyama admitted to Famitsu the team had been aiming for a lot more sales than it eventually received. And, while he acknowledged its "cult favourite" status, he also speculated its reception might ultimately have been down to confusion over whether it was supposed to be a horror or action game.

<p>
Commercial success isn't the team's only goal, Toyama stressed, and it remains determined to take on new challenges. That's despite personal concerns around his advancing age. "As for how long we'll be able to continue," he explained, "it becomes a difficult topic especially if we take my age into consideration. However, I believe that moving forward, I also have to pass the baton to the next generation. As a studio, we're still midway to reaching our goal."
</p>
<p>
Toyama isn't the only renowned developer to publicly ponder their age in recent years, of course. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">wrote</a> he "[couldn't] help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", adding: "Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." And speaking to The Guardian in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/30/nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-mario-zelda-switch-pikmin-splatoon">Shigeru Miyamoto joked</a>: "More so than retiring, I'm thinking about the day I fall over... In this day and age you have to think about things in a five-year timespan, so I do think about who I can pass things on to, in case something does happen."
</p>
<p>
Back to Toyama, Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was won over by the "singular and unapologetically strange" Slitterhead in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-review">four star review last year</a>, so it'll certainly be interesting to see what Bokeh does next.

<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157415/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Pac-Man</strong>, as iconic as he is, has felt like he’s been in a bit of a rut in recent years. The rather delightful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_99">PAC-MAN 99</a> aside, there’s an undeniable sense that the series has simply been unable to break away from its core concepts. So, regardless of what gimmicks are chucked in to justify a new entry — Battle Royale in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_mega_tunnel_battle_chomp_champs">Chomp Champs</a>, endless runner in <strong>Pac-Man 256</strong>, co-op in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pac-man_championship_edition_2_plus">Championship Edition 2 Plus</a> — I often come away thinking, 'Yep, it’s definitely Pac-Man.' This might be enough for some, but more than 40 years after its arcade debut, many are hoping for a bit of a shake-up.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>. Developed at Bandai Namco Studios, this side-scrolling adventure is worlds apart from what you’ve likely come to expect from the pill-muncher. Set in a quiet, foreboding landscape with various biomes, the closest comparison that came to mind was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Indeed, Shadow Labyrinth takes many cues from Team Cherry’s masterpiece, including the precise way that currency scatters on the ground from fallen enemies, hot springs to recover health, an eccentric merchant lurking underground, and a stylish, almost hand-crafted art style.</p>
<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157410/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet to call Shadow Labyrinth a straight-up Metroidvania would be <em>slightly</em> misleading. Yes, there are multiple areas with a few branching pathways, and you do have the ability to teleport to locations you’ve already visited, but it mostly feels like you’re being driven down a fairly linear path; pushed from checkpoint to checkpoint. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just something to keep in mind. It has much in common with Hollow Knight, but that sense of being lost in a dense, complex world isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>You play as Swordsman No. 8, who at the start of the game discovers PUCK (an entirely unsubtle reference to Pac-Man’s original name, Puck-Man), a mysterious yellow orb who enlists No. 8 to accompany it on a mission. PUCK is — as well it should be — the star of the show, and while it is your companion throughout the game, its motivations and personality left me feeling somewhat uneasy. It’s very much a character laser-focused on its goal, and it doesn’t care who or what stands in its way.</p>
<p>And so, with the power to attack enemies granted, you set off on your adventure. At first, you have a basic three-hit combo at your disposal, but by defeating certain boss characters, PUCK can transform into a hideous beast and gobble them up, thus providing new abilities. You’ll gain an extra, more powerful hit to your combo, a parry move, the ability to dodge in mid-air, and more. It’s all pretty standard stuff, but there’s a good sense of progression as you slowly become more powerful throughout the game.</p>

<p>Yet the most interesting power is the ability to transform into GAIA, a ferocious mech that provides temporary invincibility while you eviscerate your enemies. It only lasts for about 30 seconds, so it’s best left for moments where you might feel outnumbered or overpowered. It’s particularly useful during boss fights, during which you can usually chip away about a quarter of a boss’ health meter while in GAIA form, provided you’re aggressive enough with your attacks.</p>
<p>GAIA can also gobble up the bodies of your fallen foes, even while you’re in standard Swordsman form. By clicking the right stick while standing in front of a body, a disembodied version will grab the body and shove it in its mouth while emitting the same sound that classic Pac-Man makes when eating a ghost. This does two things: firstly, it lets you build up more energy to unleash GAIA in its full form; and secondly, it grants you specific ingredients based on the enemy type. These ingredients can then be used to boost your abilities at certain save points.</p>
<figure><a title="Shadow Labyrinth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157411/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so very <em>not</em> Pac-Man, right? Well, there are moments in the game that feel a bit more familiar if you’re after a more traditional ghost-gobbling experience. Every now and then, you’ll come across blue surfaces that, in your regular Swordsman form, are inaccessible. Once you touch it, however, you’ll turn into PUCK and race across the surface, with your mouth opening and closing rapidly, just like the old-school games.</p>
<p>In this form, you can travel up vertical walls and even on ceilings, and PUCK will gobble up any collectible currency along the way, with the classic sound effect present and correct. You can also jump from different surfaces, and your attack in this form is a really neat circular motion with the sword. My only criticism of this mechanic is that it doesn’t show up half as much as it should – it’s really cool.</p>
<p>But then you’ve also got the hidden maze sections, too. Accessed via stone sculptures that almost look like gravestones, these provide the quintessential Pac-Man experience, albeit with PUCK’s specific new abilities. It’s a nice little throwback to the classic arcade approach for Pac-Man, and those who are not keen on Shadow Labyrinth’s new direction will find some comfort here.</p>

<p>Overall, however, the best way I can describe Shadow Labyrinth’s gameplay is 'good enough'. It’s perfectly serviceable and enjoyable, but there’s very little here that hasn’t been done elsewhere and better. The Hollow Knight comparison in particular is unavoidable and I have a hard time believing that it wasn't Bandai Namco's primary influence. You can understand why a team would want to borrow elements from such a stellar game, but goodness, it’s such a high bar, and Shadow Labyrinth unfortunately never manages to reach it.</p>
<p>That said, the environments are consistently enjoyable, with plenty to differentiate one biome from another. I particularly enjoyed the sci-fi-focused Giant Black Tower area, with music that almost reminded me of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series – pretty wild stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of the same enemy types can crop up, though, almost to the point where I’d shake my head and exclaim, <em>“Really, you guys</em> again<em>?!”</em> The boss characters are a highlight, though, and often provide hefty challenges. I’d prefer the checkpoints to be a little more generous in these instances, but it’s not a major issue. Perhaps a simple ‘Retry’ option would be helpful in a future update.</p>

<p>Performance on Switch 2 is pretty decent for the most part, and anybody who buys the Switch 1 version can get a free upgrade on the newer console. Within the majority of major areas, you’re looking at a solid 60fps with strong image quality. Some areas, particularly those set outside, can stutter occasionally, but I didn’t find it to be distracting. Given the aesthetic and the overall lack of visual effects, I would have expected the frame rate to be consistent throughout, so it’s a little disappointing that it’s not. Still, like the gameplay itself, it’s <em>good enough.</em></p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're intrigued by Shadow Labyrinth's fresh approach to Pac-Man, I recommend giving it a shot on Switch 2. It provides an intriguing narrative in a foreboding world with varied environments throughout, and PUCK proves to be a compelling character. The short bursts of Pac-Man-style gameplay help mix up the experience, and this is very welcome since the game never really delivers a 'wow' moment. Much of it has been done better elsewhere, but this is nevertheless a promising new direction for an ageing franchise; one I hope to see continue in the future.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has released its latest report on the top 10 games for June 2025 by both monthly active users (MAU) and revenue. In its report for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">May 2025</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign was the top story, but this time around, it's Dune all June, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-patch-notes-deep-desert-changes/">Dune: Awakening</a> breaks into the top-5 games by revenue, and Sloclap's arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a> is able to eek into the top-10.</p>



<p>Nightreign hasn't entirely fallen off the map, to be fair, it's just a few places behind where it sat in May, as Dune: Awakening took Nightreign's place as the number five game in the list of top 10 games by revenue. Rematch, for its part, made it to number nine, while everything else in the top 10 rankings mostly stayed the same, save for Valorant jumping up six places to make it into the top 10 at number seven.</p>



<p>Zooming out a bit more into the top-20, other notable entries are Toby Fox's Deltarune, which snuck in at number 20, and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which arrived at the tail-end of June and made it into the top-20 games by revenue in 15th place. </p>



<p>Dead By Daylight was another notable entry in the top-20 games by revenue, in part because it was one of the few games to hold a top-20 spot in both revenue and MAUs for June 2025. It jumped 17 places from May to make it into the top-20 games by revenue for June, and 13 places to do the same in MAUs, both driven by a new collaboration with Five Nights at Freddy's.</p>



<p>The MAU list for June 2025 was less malleable than the revenue list, as very little changed regarding the top 10. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, Rematch, and Splitgate 2 were the only games not in the top-20 for MAUs in May 2025 that were able to jump into the top-20 for June.</p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full report and overview for June 2025 for the top games on PC and consoles: </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Shiro Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap covering the rest of 2025, and there's plenty on the way this year, including DLC that will let you build and manage your very own fiefdom.</p>

<p>Back in February, Shiro revealed its roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">for the first half of the year</a>, and now, it's time to discover what lies in wait throughout the remainder of 2025, starting with a major community update this very month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/537733876590575648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the update, which is set to arrive at the end of July, will bring new Tier 5 armor and weaponry, as well as a new notification log, 20 new traits, and 40 new confessions, some of which are "unique confessions" that have been "written specifically for unique characters you may recruit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=HciknQD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=IaTQxBdk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff throughout the rest of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, a major new DLC pack is arriving in September, and as Shiro says, it's "time to claim your own fief". You'll be able to build and expand said fief, rule over your subjects, and construct districts, all while tending to the needs of your population.</p>

<p>Doing so will involve not only making decisions about the lives of your subjects, but also producing and procuring resources for the healthy maintenance of your lands, all of which will shape the "identity of your fief", as Shiro puts it.</p>

<p>In future, two different kinds of DLC will be produced by Shiro, namely Expansions and Contracts. The former are large-scale additions that bring new regions, storylines, or factions to the game, while the latter are slightly smaller addons with new systems or "modular content that enhances replayability".</p>

<p>To that end, at some point in the fourth quarter of the year, a new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>DLC pack will arrive that adds a new region and a new storyline, so under the new system, that'll be an Expansion rather than a Contract.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Doing so extends the normal cut off distance for raids—a little over the length of a football field—to allow players to join from farther away. </p><p>It’s a technique players have been talking about for years—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@pokemongohandbook/video/7371090844918517038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pokemongohandbook/video/7371090844918517038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s one how-to video on TikTok from May 2024</a></span>—but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Discord messages</a></span> warning players that the exploit violates <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s terms of service has stoked fears that they could soon be banned for having participated in what the game’s developers consider to be cheating. “We have been informed today that use of GPS drift to swap out raid passes is against TOS,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shiny_kingt/status/1943732704920391889?s=46&amp;t=zQj7U0qugC7oe78CYR7CEQ&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawLl1QZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF6ZFRmQnZpZVVySDJ2NVZHAR60RxYFplRnGdA5LspA_s5RgeuhtkCPUWZA-X_h48a2OyYeDkrB5-0Y_Z2Waw_aem_U9NwmQ6IXC-DpFF6_oSTNQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shiny_kingt/status/1943732704920391889?s=46&amp;t=zQj7U0qugC7oe78CYR7CEQ&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawLl1QZleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF6ZFRmQnZpZVVySDJ2NVZHAR60RxYFplRnGdA5LspA_s5RgeuhtkCPUWZA-X_h48a2OyYeDkrB5-0Y_Z2Waw_aem_U9NwmQ6IXC-DpFF6_oSTNQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the messages</a></span> to fans read. “Niantic can track it and is going to start cracking down on it.

One reason could be related to Pokémon Go’s ongoing tug-of-war between getting players out in the world meeting one another IRL and letting them pay to sit back and enjoy the collectathon from the comfort of their air-conditioned apartment. Raid passes which cost roughly $1.50 each let players join special battles from afar. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting with the Crown Clash Take Over event in May</a></span>, players were allowed to begin using remote raid passes for Shadow raids as well, and Niantic also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upped the number of remote raids players could do each day</a></span>. </p><p>Given how wonky GPS tracking can be in<em> Pokémon Go </em>to begin with, some players are now worried they’ll get unfairly flagged for cheating if their character accidentally gets bounced around the map. “My bathroom sometimes launches me across town, I checked where I was once and it was a place 15 minutes away from where I lived,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the SylphRoad subreddit. “I’m a suburban player and will very often stop placed when I’m driving to play from my car, especially when it’s 90+ and humid out, and there are tons of errors when I have to restart the app to get it to register that I’m no longer driving or am in a new area from where I was when I minimized it and started driving,” complained another. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asked by <em>IGN</em></a></span> for confirmation of whether GPS drifting was considered cheating, the <em> Pokémon Go</em> team pointed to the cheating section of its TOS which states, “Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).” As<em> IGN</em> points out, that section includes a ban on playing with multiple accounts as well, something that’s also been a part of the game for years without any apparent major crackdown. So, is there a ban wave coming for people trying to remote raid for free? Or are players getting freaked out about a years-old exploit for no apparent reason? For now at least, Niantic seems content to let those fears persist. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-remote-raid-chat-gps-drift-niantic-ban-1851786470]]></content:encoded>
