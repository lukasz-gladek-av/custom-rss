<p>Capcom has just announced the acquisition of Minimum Studios, an animation company that has worked with Capcom extensively in the past. Minimum specialises in face and body animation and most recently contributed to the development of Dragon’s Dogma 2. The Taiwanese company was acquired through a share purchase, with Capcom paying the equivalent of just $27,000 to secure the studio. </p>

<h2 id="h-bolstering-effort">Bolstering Effort</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240701.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a> published by Capcom to announce the acquisition, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based in Taiwan, Minimum Studios’ strength lies in animation production for consumer home video game development, and the studio has carried out work on major Capcom titles in the past. Capcom decided to make the studio its subsidiary company to sustainably bolster its developmental and technological capabilities, aiming to achieve its long-term management goal of 100 million units in annual sales.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, Capcom confirmed the ongoing development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/">of a new Resident Evil game</a>, which is being led by the director of Resident Evil 7. Nothing is known about the game, but it was said that it’s going to be a substantial offering, suggesting it’ll be bigger than recent titles, including Resident Evil Village.</p>



<p>Capcom also lifted the lid on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> last week. It has been dubbed more of a remake than a remaster, and it’s coming on September 19.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s first season is officially here and players are exploring all it has to offer, from the new GSK faction to the fresh weapons introduced to bolster the already considerable line-up. However, there’s one part of the recent update that’s proving to be a sticking point with players worldwide.</p>



<p>When ushering in Season One, Ubisoft tweaked the ‘Spiderbot’ ability that’s basically the bread and butter of the DedSec faction, making it so that you can no longer instantly remove it from your face when it jumps at you and attacks.</p>



<p>This has understandably vexed fans the world over.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impossible-to-defend">Impossible to Defend</h2>



<p>The Spiderbot has been an issue since players started unlocking and running the DedSec faction in Ubisoft’s fresh first-person shooter. It scurries along the floor almost unnoticed and then leaps at your face, stunning you for a few seconds before imploding. When it hits, you can’t see and you’re rendered almost completely immobile – and if that doesn’t sound bad enough, consider that there’s almost no way to defend against it.</p>



<p>If you see it fast enough, you can shoot it, or you can hack it if <strong>you’re </strong>playing as a DedSec faction member. The go-to defence originally was to look down and shoot, which 90% of the time would result in the Spiderbot instantly falling off. It could have been a bug, but it worked.</p>



<p>Now, Ubisoft has updated the Spiderbot and made it so that this defence tactic doesn’t work. If you don’t see it coming, it’s tough – you’re going to be stunned, and that’s that. Now, players are running the Spiderbot en-masse, with entire teams taking up the DedSec mantle to get their hands on this OP ability that can lock off a squad’s ability to fight in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Awkward.</p>

<h2><strong>“Ghost on the Road” by A Shell in the Pit</strong></h2>



<p>Any road trip can be boiled down to its soundtrack: what playlist you made, what podcast you downloaded, what radio station held on for most of the way. My time with <em>Pacific Drive</em> is no exception, as developer Ironwood Studios pack the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2tBP1dwFaPhamQJOuqo3nv">in-game radio</a> with 26 songs from 27 credited artists. For as familiar as I become with each individual track, hearing them countless times for more than 30 hours, I never spot an obvious order, with one specific tune always following another.</p>



<p>The first one that plays, though, is always “<a href="https://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/ghost-on-the-road">Ghost on the Road</a>” by A Shell in the Pit. The song starts right as I slide into my nameless driver’s POV for the first time and turn the key in the ignition. It’s the 90s, so I check a physical map for instructions (“Stay on the roads”) and toss it into the vacant passenger seat—only the car radio accompanies me on this trip, a delivery to the mysterious Olympic Exclusion Zone that has swallowed the northwestern United States.</p>



<p>The opening guitars are dramatic, almost ill-fitting for my unhurried tutorial journey across winding, wooded roads. It feels like a “real” radio song in that way, not created or curated for a fictional moment so much as emerging by chance out of the waves. The sky grays into rain clouds, as though rising to meet the ominous pitch of the song, which gives way to apocalyptic lyrics over a heartbeat pulse: “Sulfur and smoke” and “rivers for spines / between the dry pines / over bones unbecoming.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I start the windshield wipers to clear off the raindrops, flip on the headlights to show me the way toward the vast gray walls surrounding my destination. The music garbles into static and then silence. The terrain flickers and bubbles into a vortex that swallows me up, spitting me out on the other side of the Zone’s concrete enclosure. The car does not travel with me, but as I stumble on foot through irradiated brush, I come upon another vehicle: a station wagon shining a single headlight beam into the poison air.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>It takes me a while to start the music in the new car. At first, the airwaves are occupied by two of the Zone’s quirky residents, who direct me to shelter at an abandoned auto shop that will become my home base for the entire game. Attached to a dingy old gas station, it’s the former stomping ground of Dr. Ophelia “Oppy” Turner, a prickly old scientist who once worked for ARDA, the company at the center of whatever incident birthed the Zone. (And yes, in a happy accident of cultural synergy, we now all know that “Oppy” was also the nickname of J. Robert Oppenheimer.)</p>



<p>I never meet these characters in-person. Oppy and the others are only ever disembodied voices, not so different from the soundtrack in that way. And it’s not until after they go silent that my first-person POV brushes over the ceiling-mounted radio, while I’m fiddling with the big terminal that Oppy has me dig up and install over the passenger seat.</p>



<p>I don’t remember what played the first time I switched on that radio. The song that springs to mind, though, is “<a href="https://leonlive.com/track/2504830/doctor-juice">Doctor Juice</a>.” Even before I had heard every song several times over, I could immediately pick out this dirty, bluesy ditty from the sleazy guitar riff, the cricket chirp of the backbeat. Sound carries differently depending on how high I set the radio volume, as well as whether I’ve left a car door open and where I’m standing in relation to it. Up until I discover the garage jukebox, I tune up the station wagon with the passenger-side door ajar because it faces the workbench.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These details are everything in <em>Pacific Drive</em>. I can hit a shortcut key for the windshield wipers, but I can also click on the levers near the steering wheel to start them instead. I take slight damage if I close the trunk while standing directly beneath it. Being able to use the radio, to “skip” songs by tuning to another station, is as crucial as any of these small touches to making the car feel tangible, a physical object taking up space in front of me.</p>



<p>Out in the Zone, I get used to hearing the “Doctor Juice” chorus, the repeated croak of “Doctor Juice / Sister Squeeze,” and if I hear the volume fade, that means the car is moving away from where I left it. Sometimes, that’s because a Zone entity has gotten hold of the vehicle, dragging it away with a dangling magnet or zapping the engine to make it charge forward. Other times, it means that I forgot to set the parking brake.</p>



<h2><strong>“Forty Fives Say Six Six Six” by King Dude</strong></h2>



<p>I should say, “Doctor Juice” is not quite typical for <em>Pacific Drive</em>’s radio. There’s variety to be sure: the synth instrumentals of Eyeliner’s “<a href="https://orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/track/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>”, the ethereal longing of Lemolo’s dream pop “<a href="https://lemolomusic.bandcamp.com/album/swansea">Swansea</a>”, the brassy gospel of Mark Crawford and Kenny Lee Young’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh9YAWkQh34">Holy Mystery</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much of the soundtrack, though, is of a piece with “Ghost on the Road”, skewing toward rock and especially downbeat folk. King Dude’s “<a href="https://kingdude.bandcamp.com/track/forty-fives-say-six-six-six">Forty Fives Say Six Six Six</a>” is the most sinister of the bunch, made up of spare acoustic guitar strums and a blasphemous gravel whisper: “Don’t believe in the crucifix” and variations on “All his 45s say 666.” These moodier moments reflect the tensions inherent to traveling the Zone, where the terrain always changes and there’s no mid-game save to fall back on. Everything I need is out there—the raw materials for all manner of upgrades to the station wagon, my own survivability, or the garage itself—and in true survival roguelike fashion, I lose much of my loot if I don’t make it back in one piece.</p>



<p>To return to Oppy’s garage, I have to tear open a portal using energy I’ve accumulated from mechanical orbs across the Zone. The catch is that these orbs act as stabilizers for the ever-shifting terrain, so removing one throws the surrounding area into flux. I’ve snatched an orb and then booked it for the station wagon only for the vehicle to shoot skyward because a geyser suddenly opened underneath.</p>



<p>Other fluctuations occur simply from sticking around too long. Radiation migrates, enemies travel, and storms of area-destroying instability begin swallowing the entire map, which is also what happens as soon as I spawn an exit portal. As careful and as thorough as I might try to be, sometimes I have no choice but to floor it, risking whatever damage may come from a frantic, off-road exit.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a game of repetition. I go out into the Zone, I scavenge materials, I hear “Doctor Juice / Sister Squeeze” again, I return to the garage, I make repairs.</p>



<p>And how the car needs repairs. Each piece takes individual damage, and deeper into the Zone, one enemy will outright remove parts and fly off with them. Every time I return to the garage, there’s something to work on (and often before that, if I have a spare moment out in the Zone). I get out and I slather on some repair putty, or I break out the blowtorch. Left unchecked, a car part can develop permanent damage, and the only thing to do at that point is find a replacement, which means crafting, which means finding the materials out in the Zone, which is painless enough (at first, anyway).</p>



<h2><strong>“The Freeze” by Worse in Person</strong></h2>



<p>I don’t recognize anything on the soundtrack, and I like it that way—most of the artists are either local to the Pacific Northwest or have roots in the area, with Spotify listener counts ranging from upwards of 90,000 to just shy of 3,000. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/a-shell-in-the-pits-studio-director-talks-us-through-pacific-drives-radio-soundtrack-and-his-song-ghost-on-the-road">Apart from “Ghost on the Road”,</a> none of the songs in <em>Pacific Drive</em> were designed for it, and that’s probably why they work so well, fueling the atmosphere without calling too much attention to themselves. They are not era-accurate, but they feel broadly appropriate.</p>



<p>Worse in Person’s punky anthem “The Freeze”, for example, could slot right into a 90s playlist between trumpet blasts of ska, even though the song is modern. Its <a href="https://worseinperson.bandcamp.com/track/the-freeze-2">Bandcamp page</a> says “2020,” and there’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/k8i5a2/worse_in_person_the_freeze_a_song_about_the/">Reddit thread</a> from the same year soliciting feedback. The lyrics shout out Bill Nye, that most 90s of science icons, but a line like “My phone, I fuckin’ dropped it” would conjure a much different image to a pre-2000 listener.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> isn’t meant to be an exact recreation of the 1990s—the game plays out in an alternate history, after all—but the signifiers of the era go much deeper than nostalgic window dressing. All that chunky technology is crucial to what the game is going for, a tactility that’s worlds apart from modern, Apple-esque minimalism. At the center of that sensibility is the station wagon itself, an uncool emblem of a time before car companies had so de-emphasized the owner’s capacity for home repair.</p>



<p>Oh, and a lot of the lyrics involve cars. Maybe that sounds a little on the nose, but in practice, it’s quite broad, given the prevalence of cars and driving as metaphor. To tap into world-weariness and overall powerlessness, “The Freeze” uses the imagery of driving a junker: “My tires have gone flat / I did not forget I neglected to pump them / The paint is chipped and the brakes are squeaking / I’m burning oil and something’s leaking.”</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>The car lyrics are everywhere when you start looking for them, even in the broadest possible terms. “Doctor Juice,” which the artist’s website <a href="https://leonlive.com/track/2504830/doctor-juice">alleges</a> is about an “overzealous chiropractor”, becomes about repairing your vehicle: “She said she would fix my body / in that old-fashion way.” Then, I suppose, there’s “juice” as in the car battery or the gasoline (the Zone has advanced beyond the need for oil), even though in context it’s clearly the, uh, aftermath of when the good doctor “squeezed me till I popped.”</p>



<p>On its own, the car maintenance doesn’t get on my nerves. It’s inconvenient yet still simplified, and it needs to be a bit of both so it can feel purposeful without feeling like directionless tedium. To achieve the elusive ideal of video game immersion, of tangibility and tactility, there’s a sweet spot that a menu screen option to fix everything simply does not reach.</p>



<p>The problem is everything that goes along with the maintenance, the crafting and the scavenging and the traveling in order to do the scavenging. In the early hours of <em>Pacific Drive</em>, scavenging is a simple matter of poking through rusted-out wrecks and abandoned ARDA trailers. I open their containers and hit “transfer all”, heedless of how many different material types there are because any amount of scavenging reliably gets me what I need.</p>



<p>But as the game goes on, the ingredient lists only get longer and more complex. I start needing to track down specific materials before I can proceed, some only found deep in the Zone. Others require certain tools that not only take up inventory space but have limited durability themselves. Everything needs to be replaced eventually.</p>



<h2><strong>“Puzzle Pieces” by Lemon Boy</strong></h2>



<p>Pieces, car parts. “You’re going way too slow.” You get the idea. We create meaning as much from content as we do from context, from when and where we hear something. We stitch ourselves into the middle of music that speaks to us, as though the singer IS speaking to us.</p>



<p>Lemon Boy’s “<a href="https://lemonboyband.bandcamp.com/track/puzzle-pieces">Puzzle Pieces</a>” didn’t start out as one of my favorites, but it grew on me over time. Repeated exposure will do that on occasion, fortifying something in your mind rather than wiling away at what you once liked so much. The more I paid attention to the lyrics, the more I felt the raw emotion of the relationship they describe, the desire to do everything for a person: “If you want to, I can be there for you / To pick up all of the pieces / Drag them out.” The singer pitches her voice up on the chorus, as though hedging a bit: I can, and I will, but only if you want to.</p>



<p>Only through repetition does my interaction with the station wagon become a relationship of sorts, much more authentic than the one with Oppy and the other radio folk. The game never gives me a transmitter to respond, so they’re always talking at me rather than with me.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The car, though, involves give and take. I have to maintain the thing, not just patching it up but pumping gas and charging the battery and applying my favored wood paneling to any replacement parts. In return, it gets me around the Zone while holding my scavenged items and acting as my shield, insulating my fragile human body from bolts of electricity or globs of corrosive ooze. I cringe when I ram into a tree, because I know that somebody is going to have to fix the damage, and that somebody is me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relationships take work. Some of them take too much work.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>We listen to media on a drive to occupy ourselves, to distract from how we are sitting in the same position in the same vehicle traveling through a landscape that does not change all that much. The same road cutting through similar fields. With the decline of physical media and the rise of streaming services, there’s an endless rotation of listening material to help ride out the monotony, as long as you’ve got the data plan for it (or at least the foresight to plan some downloads ahead of time).</p>



<p>It seems almost appropriate, then, that the 90s-set <em>Pacific Drive</em> is stuck without enough music to last the whole trip, like someone who forgot a binder full of CDs on a bed or a kitchen table. 26 songs sounds like a lot until that 101 minutes of music has to occupy more than 30 hours of drive time.</p>



<p>And as the soundtrack loses its luster, the monotony grows more intense. The portals I use to conveniently return to the garage are a one-way trip; if I want to get back to some deep-Zone resource hotspot, I need to drive there all over again. The terrain may change every time, but I’m no longer paying attention to the terrain, no longer even stopping—it’s nothing more than the distance between the garage and where I need to go. Road trips are novelties, a once-in-while attraction; the late game of <em>Pacific Drive</em> becomes a commute.</p>

</figure>



<p>The line between immersion and busywork is razor-thin, and here, the game shifts from one to the other with just a few adjusted variables and a dwindling distraction. I see the resource requirement on the crafting menu, and I groan that I’m missing one thing because all the details that so enraptured me are now miniature roadblocks. I know getting it means more listless cruising through the early Zone, more stopping to grab an orb, more setting the parking brake while I open the trunk to dig around for the tire patching kit.</p>



<p>I still have the radio on. It seems better than silence, but when I hear the opening chirp and swagger of “Doctor Juice”, I change the station.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming size and popularity of Genshin Impact, plenty of players (myself included) still don’t know much about the game or its studio. Now, with a second title set in a post-apocalyptic futuristic haven, players have questions. Namely, what kind of game is Zenless Zone Zero?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-zenless-zone-zero">What is Zenless Zone Zero?</h2>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero, an extremely nondescript name, is a free-to-play action role-playing game by HoYoverse, the studio behind Genshin Impact. It follows a similar gameplay style, with players assuming the role of a character known as a Proxy, who helps other characters explore alternate dimensions. Inside these dimensions, however, lies all manner of nasty creatures and begins, leading to the game’s frantic and flashy combat. </p>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero features real-time combat with roguelike elements. Additionally, to complement these features, you’ll participate in story and side quests, uncovering the mysteries of the post-apocalyptic world you explore and battle through. Furthermore, along the journey, you’ll meet interesting characters, find loot and battle creatures, and focus on the perfect team composition to win said encounters.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-zenless-zone-zero">How to Play Zenless Zone Zero</h2>



<p>There are only a few platforms and storefronts where you can play Zenless Zone Zero upon release. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>iOS</strong></li>



<li><strong>Android</strong></li>



<li><strong>PC (Epic Games Store)</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is no word about Zenless Zone Zero coming to Steam or Xbox Series X|S, unfortunately. Considering the studio’s last game, Genshin Impact didn’t launch on either, it’s doubtful ZZZ will step out as the oddball. </p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re keeping an eye on Zenless Zone Zero, then you might also want to know how to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-kuiper-shards-in-the-first-descendant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kuiper Shards in The First Descendant</a>!

The first is that they're for Microsoft Office 2019--which is obviously a few years old and lacks some modern features found in the current version. The second is that this can only be installed on one PC or Mac. But considering how budget-friendly this deal is, those potential snags can probably be overlooked. Even for just the most popular trio of programs--Word, Excel, and PowerPoint--$25 is a <em>really </em>low price. Heck, it's a good price for the ubiquitous word processor on its own.</p>                      </div><p><span>Both the PC and Mac versions of Office 2019 come with the following five programs:</span></p><ul><li>Word 2019</li><li>Excel 2019</li><li>PowerPoint 2019</li><li>Outlook 2019</li><li>OneNote 2019</li></ul><p>Windows users will also get access to Publisher 2019 and Access 2019, while Mac users will get Teams Classic 2019.</p><p>StackSocial has several other notable Microsoft software deals right now.

<p>As a free-to-play game, more of us are liable to download and try Zenless Zone Zero on a whim than if it were a full-priced title. But with more people keen on giving it a go, knowing whether to not your system can run the game proves paramount. Here are the Zenless Zone Zero PC requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-are-the-zenless-zone-zero-system-requirements-on-pc">Here Are the Zenless Zone Zero System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>Overall, you’ll find the PC system requirements for Zenless Zone Zero are actually rather accommodating for old hardware. You can run the game on a laptop relatively well, but if you have a gaming desktop, don’t be afraid to push the graphical settings to their max to test out the art style to its fullest!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or later</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 7th Gen Intel Core i5</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 57 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or later</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 10th Gen Intel Core i7</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 57 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-pc">Where to Play Zenless Zone Zero on PC</h2>



<p>Currently, there is only one place to download and play Zenless Zone Zero on PC, and that’s through the Epic Games Store. The studio’s previous title, Genshin Impact, also launched exclusively on the EGS, and it never wound up launching on Steam at a later date.</p>



<p>We fully expect Zenless Zone Zero to follow suit. So, if you wish to play the action RPG, specifically on PC, then you must download the Epic Games Store!</p>

Along the way, she'll use a special power to interact with phantoms scattered through the world, enabling her to unleash unique abilities in combat. Throughout the journey, you'll meet over 50 characters and attempt to master over 300 skills--giving you plenty of ways to customize your fighting style. Toss in a tactical turn-based system that uses free movement on a gridless map, and you've got a strategic RPG that's shaping up to be a great successor to the original Phantom Brave from 2004.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Another month has dawned, and that means Humble has another bundle of PC games available for its Humble Choice subscribers ($12/month). This month, there are eight games available in the bundle, including some big-name indie sequels like A Plague Tale: Requiem and Ghostrunner 2, plus a selection of shooters, strategy games, and action games, all of which are yours to keep forever, even if you cancel your Humble Choice subscription. On top of the games, this month's bundle also includes a surprising bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which lets you read thousands of DC Comics in the DC Universe app. </p><h2>Humble Choice July 2024 games</h2><ul><li>Ghostrunner 2</li><li>A Plague Tale: Requiem</li><li>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</li><li>Sticky Business</li><li>Zoeti</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley</li><li>Heretic's Fork</li><li>Hyperviolent</li><li>Bonus: One-month subscription to DC Universe Infinite</li></ul><p>This month's headliner is <strong>A Plague Tale: Requiem</strong>, a steath/action sequel about a teen girl and her little brother trying to survive during the Black Death. It's a particularly fascinating sequel, because the first game came out in late 2019 just months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Reqiuem was released in 2022--you can see in this game a bit of that shift in perspective that we all experienced over the past four years.</p><p><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong>, another glossy indie, is a parkour-based action game in which the player and their enemies alike die with a single hit from a blade--this franchise is like Mirror's Edge and Dishonored had a baby that was really intense but also fun. And it's nice to have a hardcore action game that skews away from soulslike norms.</p><p>Moving away from the action genre, we've got <strong>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</strong>, a real-time strategy title that's all about humans vs arachnids. If you've been enjoying the Starship Troopers-esque Helldivers 2 and are itching for a change of pace, Terran Command will hit the spot.</p><p>What's cool about Humble Choice is the variety you get from the bundle each month, and July's has some particularly interesting titles. Like <strong>Sticky Business</strong>, a game about designing stickers and selling them online--Etsy Simulator, basically. Then there's a pair of deck-builders--turn-based rogue-lite <strong>Zoeti</strong>, and the casually quirky <strong>Heretic's Fork</strong>. <strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley,</strong> meanwhile, is a well-timed choice, because it's a franchise that takes place in the human mind, with a player character who is an emotion--it's a game that pairs well with a viewing of Inside Out 2. And no Humble Choice would be complete without a boomer shooter, and this month it's <strong>Hyperviolent</strong>, which plays like Doom but has the atmosphere and structure of System Shock.</p><p>And, finally, a bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which will give you access to thousands of digital comics from DC in the DC Universe app and on the web. A month of DC Universe usually costs $8, and a normal free trial for the service is only seven days. So this is a nice little addition.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership%2Fhome&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-choice-july-2024-bundle-includes-a-plague-tale-ghostrunner-2-starship-troopers-and-more%2F1100-6524664%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A subscription to Humble Choice will run you $12 per month or $129 for a year</a>. As soon as you sign up, you'll be able to access Steam keys for all eight games in the bundle, as well as a code for the DC Universe Infinite trial. Since you're getting Steam codes for the games, that means you get to keep them forever.

Here's how you can nab Claws of the Wolf and what perks are worth chasing on it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that Claws of the Wolf is back in the Iron Banner loot pool, there are a couple of ways to get ahold of one. The simplest is to just play Iron Banner matches--there's a chance that, with each match, you'll get a random weapon or armor drop, and that drop might be Claws of the Wolf. Even with only playing a handful of matches, I've already nabbed two, and since there are so many Pinnacle rewards and Iron Banner challenges to complete, odds are good that you'll get a few without any thought required.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't get a lucky drop early on, though, you're guaranteed a Claws of the Wolf for ranking up your Iron Banner reputation. The reward at reputation level 4 is one of these pulse rifles, which will add it to your Collections. At that point, you can expect it to drop from random Iron Banner engrams, and you're also able to focus those engrams to get more Claws of the Wolf from Lord Saladin.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the other reputation vendors, Saladin offers the ability to focus engrams into specific weapon drops, allowing you to choose the thing you get (although the cost is higher than if you let the engrams drop a random item instead). So once you've got Claws of the Wolf, you can burn your stocked Iron Banner engrams for new drops in an attempt to get the roll you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200"></a><figcaption>Claws of the Wolf</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Arrowhead Break: +30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Ricochet Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Headseeker / To The Pain  <ul><li dir="ltr">Headseeker: Body shots increase precision damage and aim assist for a short period of time. Body shots landed while the perk is active refresh the time.</li><li dir="ltr">To The Pain: While this weapon is equipped, taking damage increases handling and aim assist until this weapon is stowed. Taking more damage increases the effect.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Zen Moment / Rampage  <ul><li dir="ltr">Zen Moment: Causing damage with this weapon reduces recoil and flinch over time.</li><li dir="ltr">Rampage: Kills with this weapon temporarily grant increased damage. Stacks up to three times.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few good combinations for Claws of the Wolf in the Crucible, depending a bit on your playstyle and what you're going for. Generally, you want to favor stats like Range and Stability in your barrel and magazine choices, although if you really like Kill Clip, try to boost Reload Speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The main benefit of Claws of the Wolf is that, while its bullets don't hit too hard, it fires <em>extremely</em> quickly and pretty accurately. Thus, pairing Headseeker, which gives you increased precision damage when you land body shots, and Zen Moment, which increases your aim assist and decreases your flinch the more you land shots, leans into the accuracy Claws of the Wolf already sports. You're firing so many bullets so quickly that you're getting a lot of benefit out of the synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, To The Pain, a new perk in The Final Shape, gives you a similar benefit when you're under fire, increasing your aim assist as you duel and boosting your handling--great if you need to quickly whip out a shotgun to seal the deal. Zen Moment can also pair with To The Pain, but if you'd prefer a damage perk, Rampage gives you a 10% boost when you land a kill, which can help knock down secondary targets. Kill Clip can be even better--the damage boost is 25% when you reload within three seconds of a kill--but the reload on Claws of the Wolf can be painfully slow, so Rampage's automatic activation might be the better call.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">+30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flared Magwell  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Reload speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Though it's not really a PvE weapon in most cases, Claws of the Wolf does benefit from the Void double-whammy of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds, giving it some serious synergy with Void builds. To start, though, your choices on barrel and magazine are pretty open, but Handling and Reload Speed are good places to put your focus; Range and Stability matter a lot less when you're not fighting other Guardians.</p><p dir="ltr">Your main focus is on getting Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds together, which gives Claws of the Wolf some serious power in PvE. First, Destabilizing Rounds cause targets near any enemy you kill to become Volatile, which debuffs them and makes them explore, spreading around more Volatile. If you use Claws to kill a Volatile enemy, you'll trigger Repulsor Brace, which gives you an overshield. So especially when dealing with groups of weak enemies, the combination creates its own feedback loop that makes your killing more effective and your defense even stronger. Add this combo to a Void build that spreads around and takes advantage of more debuffs, and you'll get even more shields for your trouble.</p><p>Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">guides for The Final Shape</a> for god rolls and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-pubg-escape-from-tarkov-rogue-company<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw his career implode</a> following tweets from an ex-Twitch employee saying that he’d been banned from Twitch in 2020 for exchanging inappropriate messages with a minor. One by one, the dominoes fell, with his video game company, Midnight Society, dropping him and, eventually, YouTube <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1806516098717679789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonetizing his channel</a>. Numerous companies also <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1805653300433633471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">washed their hands</a> of the suddenly-radioactive streamer, including 2K Games, which said it intends to <a href="https://dexerto.com/nba-2k/nba-2k-to-remove-dr-disrespect-content-following-twitch-ban-scandal-2798463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch Dr Disrespect out of <em>NBA 2K24</em></a>. However, a small handful of other video game companies remain conspicuously silent on the matter.</p><p>PUBG Studios, Battlestate Games, and Hi-Rez Studios – the studios behind <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Escape From Tarkov</em>, and <em>Rogue Company</em>, respectively – have yet to say what they intend to do about the presence of Dr Disrespect-themed cosmetics in their games. In the latter’s case, Hi-Rez appears to have <a href="https://x.com/BravaBackshots/status/1806461920792203736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quietly disabled <em>Rogue Company</em>’s Dr Disrespect skin</a>, but while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/it_be_pretty_disrespectful_if_theres_not_a_refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community chatter suggests</a> that a refund is on the way for those who purchased the skin, the company hasn’t confirmed this via any of its official channels. The game also contains a Dr Disrespect-themed level called The Arena, which players who claim to have spoken with Hi-Rez say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/comment/lanjz8l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be removed</a>. Aftermath reached out to Hi-Rez multiple times but did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, there does not appear to be any motion on <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Tarkov</em>’s ends, despite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1dog8vs/take_dr_disrespect_armor_out_of_the_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requests from <em>Tarkov </em>players</a> to remove official Dr Disrespect armor, which can be found and equipped during matches. <em>PUBG</em>, on the other hand, added Dr Disrespect weapon skins as part of a limited-time promotion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/578080/view/4580680095902954038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the way back in 2018</a>, meaning they’re pretty hard to come by these days. Neither Battlestate Games nor PUBG Studios replied to requests for comment from Aftermath.</p><p>Scrubbing in-game items and issuing refunds where necessary is likely a more complicated process than terminating a deal with the disgraced streamer, but it’s still notable that while the likes of Mountain Dew and the San Francisco 49ers moved quickly to distance themselves from Beahm, a trio of major video game companies continue to tiptoe around the issue without even cluing players in to their future plans. Perhaps they need more time, or perhaps this is simply not a priority for them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24191083/how-to-pronounce-scadutree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vt1KBU">Was anyone going to tell me I’ve been pronouncing “scadutree” wrong, or did I have to find out from a TikTok comment?</p>
<p id="7jSsdB"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC introduces consumables called Scadutree fragments. These are found at Sites of Grace in the Land of Shadow, and they’re used to power up your character.</p>
<p id="eB165C">“That’s a silly-looking word,” I thought when I first read about them, mentally pronouncing it as “skad-oo-tree.”</p>
<p id="jTDG1N">But the word “scadu” is derived from the Old English “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sceadu">sceadu</a>,” and should be pronounced more like “shadu,” or, you know, “shadow.” Shadow-tree. This information comes from distressed linguistics majors and history enthusiasts all over the internet, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1doh93s/scadutree_pronunciation/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1805786548887003200">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@polygon/video/7385239706390252842">the comments of our own TiKTok page</a>.</p>
<p id="2ObjOS">This shouldn’t exactly have come as a surprise. <em>Elden Ring</em> has long used Old and Middle English, as well as Welsh and Irish words that Americans never learned to pronounce. I certainly breathed a sigh of relief when certified Irishman Cian Maher did us yanks a service by <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333">tweeting the correct pronunciation</a> of the Lands Between’s Siofra River before I ever had to say the word out loud.</p>
<div id="MQ0TsG">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gonna blow all non-Irish Elden Ring players' minds: Siofra is pronounced Sheef-rah</p>— Cian Maher (@cianmaher0) <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2022</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="JXuMSc">The devotion to including Celtic languages like Welsh and Irish in translations of FromSoft games is genuinely cool. Over decades of English colonization <a href="https://www.transceltic.com/blog/deliberate-repression-of-celtic-languages">these languages were repressed, often banned</a>, and are still considered endangered.</p>
<p id="QFLwoK">Old and Middle English words like “scadu” and “gaol” are from a different linguistic family, but it’s always exciting to learn how not to embarrass myself when I talk.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24190684/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-improvements-lidar-terrain-magic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uh-oh-somebody-told-the-microsoft-flight-sim-2024-devs-about-lidar.917607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190684/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-improvements-lidar-terrain-magic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="H4NMB0">The developers of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/8/19/21374936/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-pc"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> have a lot to be proud of. Last month, at the <a href="https://flightsimexpo.com/">FlightSimExpo 2024</a> in Las Vegas, representatives crowed about their 15 million users and one billion flight sessions logged — numbers Asobo Studio claims put them at the top of the heap as the most-played flight simulation ever published. Now the studio is back on that grind cranking out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a>, due out this fall. Asobo calls it “the most ambitious sim ever undertaken,” and given its track record, I’m inclined to believe them.</p>
<p id="34V1gL">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a6riRXgRsCU?si=YsNMzmobIUpM1vDS">lengthy talk</a>, delivered by head of Microsoft Flight Simulator <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23179045/microsoft-flight-simulator-space-shuttle-update-gliders-40th-anniversary">Jörg Neumann</a> and Asobo Studio co-founder and CEO Sebastian Wloch, stretches over an hour and a half. But those 90 minutes include lots of delicious morsels for dedicated virtual pilots — enhancements such as app-based offline flight planning, increased density of ground traffic at major airports, and the ability to actually step out of the cockpit to perform pre-flight checks in first-person. </p>
<p id="8Cbmxp">But the tidbit that should turn PC and console player’s heads the most is the invocation of a new partner, a company that Microsoft recently acquired called <a href="https://www.vexcel-imaging.com/">Vexcel Imaging</a>.</p>
<p id="RUiMdw">Vexcel is a groundbreaking imaging company known for its UltraCam line of aerial survey cameras. These multi-spectrum arrays include more traditional RGB color sensors alongside near-infrared sensors. Combined with their software, the result is a dramatic increase in the resolution of image data being shared with the team of designers at Asobo — as evidenced by <em>MSFS 2024</em>’s recent teaser trailer, shown at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<div id="BvMwti"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvzlC4iCtns?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="xMISN7">Neumann used a bit of his time on stage at FlightSimExpo to let fans peek behind the curtain, so to speak, at what was actually being shown in that trailer — specifically in its opening moments as a single-engine airplane flies over Monument Valley in Arizona. </p>
<p id="4WuLN3">“The natural environments are something that people have never seen before,” Neumann said. “Not on this scale, certainly not in this level of detail.” Then he handed the reins to Wloch to go a little bit deeper. You can watch the full segment around <a href="https://youtu.be/a6riRXgRsCU?t=848">the 14-minute mark</a>. </p>
<p id="bPgT37">What’s important to understand is that previously, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> had been applying three-dimensional assets — things like houses and trees — automagically on top of two-dimensional data. But there’s only so far you can take that kind of automation, which is why the first time I flew over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20885197/microsoft-flight-simulator-bing-maps-hands-on-demo">Great Pyramid at Giza</a>, the complex of pyramids was surrounded by a forest of oddly brown deciduous trees instead of sand dunes. Using UltraCam data to do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">photogrammetry</a> — that is, 3D reconstruction of real-world elements from nothing but image data — gives Asobo’s terrain-rendering software a lot more to work with.</p>
<p id="DxWhJr">“We now have the ground, which is all 3D, instead of [...] 2D with a texture,” Wloch said. “There’s a lot of different 3D materials [including] the grass, the rocks, and the trees. Everything is now 3D [...] and everything is procedurally generated on top of the world data.”</p>
<p id="s1awiZ">But Vexcel’s camera technology isn’t standing still. This summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/LN2vAIBb0Lo?t=415">the Austrian company is adding LIDAR to its arrays</a> as well. That will likely add <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html">altitude and relative distance</a> to the data being shared with Asobo in addition to graphical data. And that, my friends, could enable procedurally generated environments the likes of which no one has ever seen in a commercial flight simulator.</p>
<p id="FCmC5A">Expect more on <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> ahead of its <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-announcement/">Nov. 19 launch date</a>, when it will become available for purchase and as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup is now live in Riyadh, and from here, eight weeks of competition will unravel. This staggering, industry-leading event is set to change history, boasting a $60 million prize pool and more than twenty esports titles, covering everything from CS2 to League of Legends, and from Call of Duty to Rennsport. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation put on an opening ceremony to open the monumental event – and what a spectacle it was. Despite some of the concerns around the EWC, there’s no doubt this was one of the most impressive moments in the history of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-event-to-remember">An Event To Remember</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is an all-new tournament being held in Saudi Arabia. It’s a gargantuan effort that more than 1,500 esports competitors are supporting, representing around 400 teams from a whopping 100 countries. It’s the most diverse and valuable event ever seen in the ever-developing world of esports, and it all began with a stunning opening ceremony.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2187462186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the broadcast</a>, a grand stage was showcased in Riyadh, and before long, a group of masked dancers started laying down their moves. The EWC trophy was revealed under a sky illuminated by a plethora of fireworks, and a display of LED drones paraded around, painting the EWC logo high in the sky above Saudi Arabia. </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, a panel of superstar guests and presenters welcomed esports fans from around the world, with some taking the time to present some of the tournament stages that will play host to the world’s biggest gaming organisations, all of which are headed to Riyadh with the hope of winning millions of dollars.</p>



<p>Over the next eight weeks, the Esports World Cup will play out – which organisation will secure the grand prize in the Club Championship, which comes with a cash prize worth $7 million?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neva-is-a-stunning-new-puzzle-platformer-from-the-makers-of-gris<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think Neva and I are going to get along quite well.</p><p>To this end, people who know me know what kinds of games I like: first-person shooters, point-and-click adventures, story-driven third-person action-adventures, and puzzle-platformers – or as I like to call them, Limbo-likes. If your game tells a poignant, emotionally compelling story with a beautiful art style, gorgeous music, and no dialogue whatsoever, then there is a good chance that I’m going to really like that game. It doesn’t always pan out, though; Black The Fall was a shameless and mediocre clone of Playdead’s seminal 2016 masterpiece Inside. Somerville was made by an ex-Playdead developer but couldn’t quite reach the narrative heights of Limbo or Inside. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Neva Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>But Neva, the new Limbo-like from the developers of 2018’s outstanding GRIS? I played the first 45 or so minutes of it and it is checking every good box there is for this subgenre. Let me start with the obvious: no, not the art style. I’ll get to that. But the dog. OK, so Neva isn’t a dog, but she’s this universe’s mythical equivalent of a canine companion. I must’ve held the Y button down five times in the first five minutes to pet Neva, and I hope the developers at Nomada Studio include an unlockable achievement for doing so.</p><p>Anyway, Neva’s beautiful opening sequence instantly made me care about Neva and protecting her at all costs from the dark forces that are corrupting this previously pristine world. And pristine it is. As I started to mention earlier, the art style in Neva is as colorful as it is unique. I adore the full use of the color palette that’s on display here, from the muted greens of the dark forest to the bright yellow of the open plains, Neva’s world is absolutely stunning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fortunately, it shows the initial signs of having the gameplay to back it up, too. While the first three-quarters of an hour I played only served to slowly introduce the combat mechanics, eventually intertwining them with the platforming in order to create the puzzle-platforming these types of games are known for, that meandering path was an engaging one. I was riveted the entire time, wondering what might come next. My hope is that Neva’s combat and puzzles continue to stack and layer on top of each other to create more and more intricate gameplay as the campaign winds on, and the boss fight that concluded my demo was a welcome sign that this indeed might be the case.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Neva was one of many games I played during June’s various summer gaming preview events, and it’s one of the few I’m still thinking about weeks later.</p></div><p>In addition, I was pleased to stumble upon a couple of secret items during my demo, suggesting that while there might not necessarily be enough meat on the bone here for multiple repeat playthroughs, there should hopefully be a bit more to look for that’s slightly off the campaign’s seemingly linear golden path. All told, Neva was one of many games I played during June’s various summer gaming preview events, and it’s one of the few I’m still thinking about weeks later. It looks like it has the potential to be very, very special.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p>The First Descendant launched today for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Given its free-to-play and multiplayer structure, The First Descendant would benefit from mechanics such as cross-play and cross-progression with different platforms. Cross-play lets players play with and against each other, regardless if they're on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox. Cross-progression lets players carry over progress from one platform to the other.</p><p>The good news is that The First Descendant supports both cross-play and cross-progression between PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. However, players must sign up for a Nexon account in order to use cross-progression. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to activate cross-save.</p><ol><li>Go to the Nexon <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/signin" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ">account linking page</a></li><li>Click on the icon of the platform you're playing on (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox)</li><li>You'll redirected to the login page for that platform and now enter your credentials</li><li>When you're logged in, authorize the link between your game account and platform</li><li>Follow the rest of the instructions and complete the authorization process</li></ol><p>The First Descendant has had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-looter-shooter-the-first-descendant-is-off-to-a-big-start/1100-6524651/" data-ref-id="1100-6524651">strong start so far</a>, with over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">200,000 concurrent players today on Steam</a>, peaking at #5 on the Steam's most played games list. The Destiny-like game follows the Descendants who have special powers to fight against the Vulgus, a race of aliens seeking the destruction of the fictional world of Ingris.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, the massive indie farming simulator, lets you and up to three friends run a farm together, via online play or couch co-op. However, since multiplayer was added post-launch and the majority of development is done by one person, there are a few modern features missing from the multiplayer. One of those features is cross-platform play, which isn't in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Stardew Valley cross-platform details</h2><p dir="ltr">Stardew Valley currently does not have cross-platform multiplayer, and it seems likely that it never will. That means if you want to play multiplayer, everyone will need to be in the same family of platforms, like Xbox or PlayStation. If one person is on Nintendo Switch and the other is on PC, you cannot play together.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Stardew Valley - Multiplayer Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Stardew Valley developer Eric Barone--also known as ConcernedApe--has not commented on cross-platform multiplayer in recent years, but did mention back in 2018 that <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1036993838613651459" rel="nofollow ">"technical barriers are very high,"</a> expressing that it's a feature that he would want to add, but it might not be possible. The developers comments are reminiscent of those from Bethesda's Todd Howard, who discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-doesnt-have-cross-play-because-it-wasnt-designed-that-way-says-todd-howard/1100-6523054/">Fallout 76</a> doesn't have cross-play, citing difficulty in adding it to a game that wasn't initially designed for it.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the other important things to know about Stardew Valley multiplayer is that multiplayer saves are stored by the host. That means in order to play on your co-op save, the host needs to be present, otherwise you cannot access the save file.</p>
