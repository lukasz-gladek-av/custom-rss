            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/control-update-will-add-hdr-and-ps4-exclusive-mission-for-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a big update for Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>, available now on PC and coming soon to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, that is bringing graphical improvements like HDR support, and making a previously PlayStation exclusive mission available for all platforms.</p>
<p>Available now on Steam and Epic, and with the GOG version to follow later, PC gamers are now able to take advantage of HDR support, 10-bit SDR support, support for up to 48:9 monitors – a ridiculously wide ratio – and a new Ultra ray tracing preset that increases the number of rays per pixel and gives higher temporal stability.</p>


<p>That last point goes hand in hand with, not only much better GPUs than were available in 2019, but also greater DLSS support. This has been updated to DLSS 3.7, includes DLAA support for more anti-aliasing and other tweaks and fixes. While it is possible to mod games with DLSS support to use AMD’s most recent FSR 4 instead, it would be good to see native support for FSR 4 down the line.</p>
<p>Additionally, all players will now have access to the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, which features voiceover by Hideo Kojima. Previously exclusive to the PS4 Digital Deluxe version of Control, anyone can now play it by picking up the first Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in&nbsp; the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector.</p>
<p>A subset of all this will be coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Control Ultimate Edition. HDR and improved SDR colour range will be the baseline improvement, but we could also see more bespoke PS5 Pro support with ray tracing enhancements. That would be pretty neat.</p>

<p>Remedy note that it’s a small team working on supporting this game, os they’re taking things slowly to avoid introducing bugs and problems as much as possible.</p>
<h3>OUTFITS</h3>
<p>The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)</p>
<h3>MISSIONS</h3>
<p>All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<h3>GRAPHICS</h3>
<p>Added HDR support<br>
Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability<br>
Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors<br>
Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera<br>
Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding<br>
Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12<br>
Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors<br>
Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus<br>
Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K<br>
Implemented texture streaming fixes<br>
Ray tracing bug fixes</p>
<h3>DLSS SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Added DLSS support for arbitrary resolutions<br>
Added DLAA support<br>
Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability<br>
Film grain added back to DLSS SR<br>
Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled<br>
Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</p>
<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p>Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn’t intended to be heard. (It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)<br>
Several bug and crash fixes</p>

			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">Wargaming</a> has announced that the original IP Steel Hunters, an upcoming free-to-play mech hero shooter, will be releasing in Early Access on April 2, 2025. This title is set to blend Battle Royale elements with Extraction mechanics and features a player-first philosophy. This Early Access phase will be beneficial to the development of Steel Hunters and will allow the community to get involved and have a say in the development of the game through their feedback. To ensure the community is kept in the loop, the developers will release information and insights as the game nears the Early Access period. To celebrate the Early Access date announcement, a brand-new trailer on the Steel Hunters YouTube channel gives you a tiny glimpse into the heart-pounding action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wargaming is the award-winning mind behind World of Tanks and World of Warships and is now trying something a bit out of its usual style of game to bring a new mech hero shooter named Steel Hunters. However, there is no saying how well this game will perform as of yet, especially in an oversaturated market of Battle Royales and hero shooters, such as Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, and Fortnite, to name a few key competitors.</p>
<p>However, Steel Hunters is set to stand out from the crowd by being a thrilling mech power fantasy where you get to control mechanical giants named Hunters, and take part in non-stop action-packed battles, where there will be a variety of objectives and tasks for you to complete on the battlefield to ensure that you level up and can acquire new gear to improve your mech.</p>
<p>Each Hunter available in the game has its own unique playstyle, ability kits, and progression systems that will provide you with the opportunity to create strategies and tactics that allow you to eliminate the opponent as you all race towards the extraction point.</p>
<p>The roster will consist of characters such as Razorside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet and Weaver, all of which have their own unique abilities that can turn them into a powerhouse on the battlefield, where you'll be able to fight it out for glory on battlegrounds such as Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights and Stonecutter Keep. You'll be battling it out against five other duo teams, and only one will be able to extract from the Hunting Grounds.</p>
<p>Those interested in playing Steel Hunters will be able to do so on April 2, 2025, on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://wargaming.net/en/wgc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wargaming Game Center</a>, depending on your preference.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mech-shooter-steel-hunters-gets-april-early-access-release-date.1131063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>World of Warships&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;World of Tanks&nbsp;</i>developer Wargaming has announced the Early Access release date for its upcoming PvPvE mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 2nd "after three years of relentless development". The game will include "the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression systems" necessary for "a strong starting point", according to Wargaming.</p>

<p>The developer is promising that the game will evolve with the input of its community; in an accompanying Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/516329641817933073" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Wargaming says it intends to "refine and expand the game together" with the player base, "ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=0agCnVZQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=-Ej4FXhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access release is set for April.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather uniquely, Wargaming also says it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>to be stuck in Early Access for a protracted period of time. The studio says the Early Access period "won't be a drawn-out process" and that the goal is to "move quickly to a full release" once feedback has helped to "polish the core experience".</p>

<p>Wargaming says it will share more information about how&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access period will unfold in the future, but for now, the game is set for an April release. It'll be free-to-play as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>, it's a mech shooter that takes place after a "cataclysmic event" leads mankind to create robots called Hunters to protect caches of Starfall, a new resource "crucial to human survival".</p>

<p>Of course, things don't quite work out, and before long, Hunters led by different factions are doing battle with one another in order to secure the precious Starfall bounty they need to ensure their prosperity.</p>




<p>The game will feature multiple different Hunter playstyles with different "destructive weapons, gear, mods, and abilities" to discover, and as well as quick reflexes, you'll also have to exhibit "sound tactics" to win.</p>

<p>If you checked out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">hugely popular demo for mech shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">Mecha Break</a>&nbsp;</em>back in February and enjoyed it, then this one may well be right up your alley too.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 2nd.</p>

Instead of<em> Disco Elysium 2</em>, it’s a spy RPG still mostly shrouded in secrecy called <em>Project</em>&nbsp;<em>[C4]</em>, and one big question facing it is whether it will bear any resemblance to the studio’s previous work after years of internal upheaval and tumult. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>[C4]</em> you play an Operant working for a corrupt global power in a world where the mind is a battlefield for geopolitical struggle and espionage. “More vulnerable and more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances amongst other means,” reads the press release from ZA/UM Studio. “Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can in order to survive the violent canvas of the real.”</p><p>Here’s the quick teaser released today which has some cool art and intriguing vibes but is light on substance. </p><p>The material was first presented to press in a scripted 10-minute presentation by <em>C4 </em>writers Jim Ashilevi (voice over direction on <em>Disco Elysium</em>) and Siim Sinamäe (additional writing on <em>Disco Elysium</em>). They confirmed that the studio has been working on the new project for about three years now and said one of the main things that will differentiate it from other RPGs is making failure “a joy in itself” rather than something players want to save-scum their way out of. The duo also cited John le Carré and his thriller<em> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> as one of the inspirations for the game, but didn’t share many specifics on what the game’s actually about or how it will play. </p><p>Most notably, the pair did not take questions and only vaguely referenced the ongoing issues facing ZA/UM, which is a very different studio than it was five years ago after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328">layoffs, firings, and departures</a></span> of some of the core team that made <em>Disco Elysium</em>, including creator Robert Kurvitz, art director Aleksander Rostov, and writer Helen Hindpere. Amid dueling allegations of theft, fraud, and abuse by the founders and current studio leadership, several new indie teams popped up last year, each <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-sequel-rpg-canceled-xxx-nightshade-1851670948?_gl=1*1vld52x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTY0MzIwMS40Ni4wLjE3NDE2NDMyMDQuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-sequel-rpg-canceled-xxx-nightshade-1851670948?_gl=1*1vld52x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTY0MzIwMS40Ni4wLjE3NDE2NDMyMDQuNTcuMC4w">claiming the mantle to creating the true <em>Disco Elysium</em> successor</a></span>.</p><p>“As with any artistic practice, attempts and failures have been a natural part of this process. Failing forward seems to be one of those things we here at ZA/UM excel at,” Ashilevi said during the <em>[C4]</em> presentation. The game, whatever it turns out to be, seems to thematically echo many of the studio’s troubles. “Betrayal is only possible in the presence of love,” Sinamäe said of the project’s spycraft storytelling. The team is planning to present more information about the upcoming game at GDC later this week. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Asus has announced its new lineup of monitors with a special ability to purify surrounding air. The lineup of new VU Air Ionizer monitors features three models: the 23.8-inch IPS panel Asus VU249HFI-W, the 27-inch IPS Asus VU279HFI-W, and the 34-inch VA Asus VU34WCIP-W.</p>



<p>These monitors feature a no-filter VU Air Ionizer that Asus says can “remove up to 90% of airborne dust in three hours” to remove various allergens and improve general indoor air quality. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“The ionizer has an effective coverage area of 1m³,&nbsp;purifying&nbsp;air throughout&nbsp;a&nbsp;workspace for comfortable productivity,” <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-vu-air-ionizer-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Asus said</a>. “With no filters&nbsp;required, ASUS VU Air Ionizer series&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;seamlessly combine air purification and&nbsp;cutting-edge&nbsp;display technologies in one streamlined design.”</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Monitor</th><th>Size and Ratio</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Refresh Rate</th><th>Panel Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asus VU249HFI-W</td><td>23.8-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU279HFI-W</td><td>27-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU34WCIP-W</td><td>34-inch/21:9</td><td>3440×1440</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>Vertical Alignment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as specs are concerned, each monitor—no matter the size—has a 100Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time. Both the 23.8- and 27-inch displays have an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel with 178° viewing angles. The 34-inch monitor is a 21:9 ultrawide VA (Vertical Alignment) panel with the same 178° viewing angles. The two 16:9 displays have a brightness of 250 nits while the 21:9 Ultrawide has a brightness of 300 nits. </p>



<p>For pricing, the 23.8-inch starts at $129.99 while the 27-inch display will cost $159.99. If you decide you want the Ultrawide air purifier, it will cost $359.99.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In less than two weeks, a new cooperative horror game called REPO on Steam has gone from 7,000 concurrent players to hitting over 145,000 users on Valve's platform (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3241660/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>). To call the online-multiplayer experience a surprise hit is probably an understatement. This is only the second title from developer Semiwork, which previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304680/Voidigo/" rel="nofollow ">Voidigo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">REPO</a>re stands for retrieve, extract, and profit operation. As such, up to six people work together in the online cooperative game to attain valuable items as quietly as possible. That's easier than it sounds in the physics-based horror game, especially in a group setting with a "grabbing tool." But there are monsters listening and waiting to make everything even more chaotic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQ-kPtObmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="176">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1OQ-kPtObmQ?start=176" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Semiwork has called the burst in popularity for REPO "quite the experience," as it's the first time the studio has utilized the Unity engine as well as made an online multiplayer game. The developer is busy with new features, enemies, and levels for the horror game--as well as addressing bugs. Additionally, Semiwork is trying to figure out the best way to address hackers without implementing anti-cheat systems, since that could negatively affect players using mods.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, a couple of fun codes were dished out by Semiwork about REPO. For example, typing "/cinematic" in the text chat will remove the UI. Additionaly, the developer says you can put "/greenscreen" into the chat for that feature to pop up in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">REPO is $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Early Access</a>. The online cooperative horror game launched February 26.</p>

                <p>According to the CEO of The Lego Group, the company may begin developing some video games internally. Niels Christiansen, who has been Lego's CEO since 2017, said in an interview that the company is ramping up to make some games in-house.</p><p>"We can definitely say as long as we're under the Lego brand we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical. [Games development in-house] is something we're building up," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FT</a>.</p><p>Many of the existing Lego games are made by external studios via a licensing arrangement. For example, Lego works with the UK studio <a href="https://www.ttgames.com/games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> on the popular Lego games based on brands like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>Lego is also in business with Epic Games for the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297"> Lego Fortnite game inside the Fortnite platform.</a> Additionally, Lego partnered with 2K for a racing game, 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-2k-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-585043">Lego 2K Drive</a>. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lego-is-starting-to-bring-its-game-development-in-house-key-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, this was the first in a series of sports games to come from this deal.</p><p>Reporter Jason Schreier said TT Games is now<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4?t=2997s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> developing a new Lego game</a> that could potentially release later in 2025 or in 2026. VGC reported that an upcoming Lego Harry Potter game may be in the works and could follow a similar format to Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga and cover the entire Harry Potter series. 2024's Lego Harry Potter Collection already did this, with the bundle comprising Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 and Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7. Warner Bros. Games is making major changes going forward and will focus only on a few core franchises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wbs-gaming-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6529747/" data-ref-id="1100-6529747">Harry Potter being one of them. </a></p><p>Another new release in the Lego game series was 2024's Lego Horizon Adventures, which adapted the events of Sony's Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo developed this title.</p><p>There is basically nothing to go on beyond Christiansen's single-sentence quote about potentially making games in-house, so it's not clear why the company might make this change, when it could happen, or if anything will change with Lego's ongoing business partnerships with outside studios.</p>

		<p>Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is heading into Steam Early Access on 2nd April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year</a>, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games with World of Tanks, World of Warships and more. This free-to-play mech hero shooter blends together battle royale and extraction shooter ideas, and Wargaming are hoping that early access will help them to quickly refine that blend, with the expectation that they will quickly get to a full release after gathering community feedback. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/steel-hunters-open-beta-brings-stompy-off-on-steam/">This will build on what they learnt from closed beta</a> periods held over the last few months.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>
<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game when it launches in April… or both!</p>

						<h5>Two Point Museum</h5><p><span>4 March, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>

			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">sandbox games</a> that allowed you to manage large areas or populations. Whether it was Theme Hospital or SimCity 2000, a lot of time was spent playing those games. As someone who loves going to museums, big or small, I knew immediately that I had to play this game, and I'm so glad I did. Truly, you can't go wrong with any of the Two Point games, but Two Point Museum excels in areas that other sandbox titles do not. Between their first game and this new title, they have learned what makes a perfectly challenging, comedic, and relaxing experience all in one.</p>
<p>It's always a little bit daunting jumping into a new sandbox game, regardless of whether you've played the previous iterations in the franchise. There's a lot of information to take on board, as well as trying to remember all the different controls and mechanics that you will need to manage throughout. However, compared to previous Two Point games, Two Point Museum definitely feels the most user-friendly, and I didn't find it nearly as anxiety-inducing to actually get stuck in and start playing. The tutorials were thorough and helped explain every mechanic you'd need to manage, with the campaign taking you through everything you needed to know at a reasonable pace without things getting too chaotic from the outset.</p>

<p>While other sandbox games have tutorials and help you work around the basics, the campaign is a thorough tutorial experience that is relatively stress-free. It helps you learn the controls and basics of the game but also provides information on some of the metrics you'll need to keep an eye on. Compared to Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new game feels incredibly accessible to those who are new to the sandbox or simulation genre and helps ease the player in gently rather than being plunged into the deep end. On top of that, even when you get into the deep end of the game, at no point did I feel like I was drowning or wouldn't be able to get myself out of trouble. Compared to games like Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, which can be devastatingly punishing, Two Point holds your hand just enough to ensure you don't sink completely under.</p>
<p>I initially started my Two Point Museum experience on PC but found that I also enjoyed playing it on the Steam Deck after initially being daunted by the idea of using a controller for this style of game. However, the controller inputs are smoother and feel easier to work with compared to a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>After playing Two Point Hospital, I didn't know how it would be possible to make the franchise even better. Still, Two Point Museum takes my love for museums and doubles it by adding the ability to create an aquarium with funky-looking fish and go on expeditions. To obtain artifacts, you have to send your Experts on expeditions, where they may get injured along the way. It makes every discovery exciting, as you never know whether you'll get a duplicate or something completely new from the map. However, duplicates don't go to waste, as you can deconstruct them to learn more about the exhibit, making it higher quality and adding perks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_18e9d7278ffdea6575ef296b3eb1e2ee0eed3b28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, like any Two Point game, you have funny announcements over the intercom, which also helps to bring your attention to when the chopper returns to the helipad. It also notifies you of things that may slip past your attention, such as exhibits needing to be restored or staff members wanting a raise. From seeing Tails and Sonic walking around your museum as staff members to the dry humor that comes through over the intercom, it's a perfectly packaged game. It's incredibly well-polished, and much love and passion went into making this experience.</p>
<p>The expeditions system is a lot of fun to try and complete, especially when it comes to needing certain perks to ensure that you can even go on the expedition. It starts off relatively safe, with minimal risk, but ramps up soon enough, and you have to really put thought into who you want to send out. If they get injured, there is a very high risk that they will ask for a significant raise, or they will just up and leave. This can be a little bit stressful, especially since at this point, the Expert will be decently leveled up. Luckily, it feels that although it can have consequences, they are fixable consequences, and it doesn't feel like a damning punishment if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>The only issue I had with Two Point Museum was the explanation given for placing staff-only doors and other types of doors on partition walls. Partition walls are in the build section and are small ropes or glass half walls to keep members of the public out of areas. It's explained that you can put a door on these for whatever function you need it for. However, the doors aren't actually compatible with the partition walls, and the game actually means that you need to use the Museum Wall to add doors.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_fc3903f36c1c6cc278db1222a6a9f337edcb3ccc.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the colors and styling of Two Point Museum, as it had a degree of vibrancy that the previous games didn't quite have. While the museums are tones of brown and beige, adding in pops of color through info boards and decorations helps to make the museum shine.</p>
<p>Although I now have multiple museums on the go, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, and I can't wait to see what other weird and wacky exhibits I unearth on my expeditions.</p>
<p>I have yet to play Two Point Museum's sandbox mode, but considering how user-friendly the rest of the game has been, I expect that, if the campaign is any indication, it will be a good experience with building difficulty.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Two Point Museum has been a dream. It is exactly everything I wanted from a brand-new Two Point game. I can't wait to see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what comes next</a> for this game and the franchise in general.</p>

				<p>I loved every moment of this game, and didn't have a single issue throughout. There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</p>

            <p>
With several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors in the works from former staff, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy regarding the exits of key team members</a> behind the beloved RPG, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">an in-development expansion cancelled</a>, you might have been wondering what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zaum">Studio ZA/UM</a> will do next. Well, that answer is here. In a recent presentation held for the press, ZA/UM revealed a first look at their next game. It's called C4 and it's about espionage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The presentation was led by Jim Ashilevi, the lead voice over director on Disco Elysium, and Siim "Kosmos" Sinamäe, a producer and writer for the RPG, who are both serving as writers on this new game. Right off the bat, Sinamäe made one thing quite clear: "This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4." The writer went on to explain that ZA/UM has "spent the last three years developing this brand new, gripping, completely original world, exploring a theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>
<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
While the presentation didn't offer a look at anything in-game, a short teaser trailer for C4 was shown which mostly consisted of a woman with a London accent talking in a very Disco Elysium-y kind of way, set to some very cool looking art. Story details were pretty slim too, but Ashilevi did explain that "C4 is all about spy games, allegiances, and betrayals. It is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, the gadgets. It is more like Slow Horses, doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or parades. No heroes, only the stench of failure." Failing forward will also apparently be a big part of what sets the game apart, with Ashilevi saying the team is making "failure a joy in itself".
</p>
<p>
This presentation is just part one of two, as ZA/UM is also apparently making an appearance at GDC later this month, where it will presumably talk more about the game.
</p>
<p>
C4 is obviously the first project following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-developer-alleges-creative-leads-were-fired-on-false-premises">the departure</a> of Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere and artist Aleksander Rostov in 2021. What followed has been a series of messy legal battles, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIGA8taN-M&amp;ab_channel=PeopleMakeGames">documentary</a> that alleged toxicity from Kurvitz and more, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">different</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">games</a> claiming to be spiritual successors. I'm looking forward to finding out if the OG ZA/UM can cut through all of that noise.

It's quite different from the military-focused multiplayer games Wargaming is best known for, such as World of Tanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warships/" data-ref-id="5000-114101">World of Warships</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warplanes/" data-ref-id="5000-107489">World of Warplanes</a>. Steel Hunters fully embraces sci-fi as a mecha game that blends elements from hero shooters, battle royales, and extraction shooters. Five teams of two players fight each other to collect a resource called Starfall on Earth, and players can win by killing all of their opponents or successfully extracting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1_2h0I6wvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Steel Hunters enters early access, it will include seven different "Hunters" for players to choose from: Razerside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet, and Weaver. Three maps scattered around Earth--Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights, and Stonecutter Keeper--will also be part of Steel Hunters from the start of Early Access.</p><p>Wargaming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=32977250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained in a Steam post</a> that it chose to put Steel Hunters through early access because it allows the developers and players to "we can refine and expand the game together, ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned." While Wargaming has not outlined a specific early access timeline, it also explained that the studio's goal "is to move quickly to a full release once your feedback has helped us polish the core experience."</p><p>Steel Hunters' early-access period will begin on April 2, exclusively on PC.

            <p>Longdue, a new studio formed by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> staff, has revealed a teaser trailer for its new project and announced the inclusion of key Disco Elysium alumni.</p>
<p>The new "psychogeographic RPG", called Hopetown, will launch a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown">Kickstarter campaign</a> on 17th March where more details will be revealed.</p>
<p>Until then, below is the first teaser trailer, which includes character artwork and an intriguing voiceover hinting at the psychological consequences of the story.</p>

<p>Lenval Brown, who voiced the narrator in Disco Elysium, will return for Hopetown and voice a key character.</p>
<p>"It feels good to be back - to step into something new," said Brown. "There's nothing like bringing a world to life, shaping a story that's been waiting to be spoken into existence."</p>
<p>What's more, Martin Luiga - founding member of the ZA/UM Cultural Association who was involved in writing Disco Elysium - has also joined the team at Longdue.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to share my experiences with Longdue to help them craft the narrative and systems for Hopetown, playing to the strengths that the narrative RPG genre has achieved thus far and attempting to innovate upon them to tell a rich story based in equal parts on what has been, what is and what could be," said Luiga. "I am confident that the team can deliver a worthy addition to the canon of Western RPGs. I call upon the fans of the RPG and adventure genre to back the Hopetown Kickstarter to help us make the game."</p>
<p>Longdue's staff also includes Piotr Sobolewski from the Disco Elysium team, though as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/535127/disco-elysium-successor-looks-just-like-disco-elysium">Polygon</a> reported earlier this month his ties to the game are loose - in the game's credits Sobolewski is listed as providing "additional development" from outsourcing studio The Knights of Unity.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Brown and Luiga therefore strengthens the ties with ZA/UM's project. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">first announced back in October</a> last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-plans-to-redefine-psychological-rpg-genre">further details on its mechanics</a> provided back in January this year.</p>
<p>However, it coexists with multiple other projects from former Disco Elysium staff, with each announcement seemingly not-so-coincidentally arriving at the same time (notably, the games were first revealed on the fifth anniversary of Disco Elysium).</p>
<p>ZA/UM, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studios-new-rpg-c4-is-a-mix-of-espionage-thriller-and-psychedelic-sci-fi">original Disco Elysium studio, has today announced its next game</a>, called C4, which blends dice-rolling gameplay with psychedelic sci-fi and espionage thriller elements. However, many original members of staff who worked on Disco Elysium have since left the studio.</p>
<p>Then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">new UK-based studio Dark Math Games</a> creating XXX Nightshift, formed of a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium", which was announced in October.</p>
<p>Shortly after that announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">Summer Eternal revealed itself as a new studio from Argo Tuulik</a>, who co-created Disco Elysium's worldbuilding.</p>
<p>Disco Elysium writer and designer Robert Kurvitz has also established a new studio called Red Info with artist Aleksander Rostov.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/messy-drama-behind-disco-elysiums-multiple-spiritual-successors-detailed-in-new-report">report in November detailed the messy drama behind the multiple Disco Elysium spiritual successors</a> in development - it followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">multiple lawsuits that are now said to be resolved</a>.</p>
<p>In the wake of this drama, though, multiple studios are now creating new projects vying to be the foremost successor to Disco Elysium - an isometric political RPG that was lauded on its release in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developer ZA/UM - or at least what remains of it after a fractious few years of mudslinging, firings, and lawsuits - has announced its next game: a dice-rolling blend of psychedelic sci-fi and espionage thriller it's calling C4.
</p>
<p>
C4 casts players as an operant serving a questionable global power who finds themselves "locked in a vicious, clandestine struggle for the truth and influence". It's a quest for secrets, set in a world of shadowy characters and concealed conflicts, that's said to offer a blend of player introspection, deep character-driven dialogue, and dice-based high-stakes encounters.
</p>
<p>
"Yet it is the mind that takes centre stage in C4," ZA/UM explains. "More vulnerable and somehow more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances. Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can to survive the violent canvas of the real."
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>C4 teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
In a brief conversation with press ahead of C4's official unveiling, ZA/UM writer Siim "Kosmos" Sianamäe shed some light on the philosophy driving C4's development. "We want to build on what we've done before," he explained, "but not simply by repeating it or rehashing it. This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4. We've spent the last three years developing this brand-new, gripping, completely original work exploring the theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>
<p>
Fellow C4 writer Jim Ashilevi added, "[This] is a game all about spy stuff - spy games, allegiances, betrayals - [but it] is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, gadgets. It's more like Slow Horses: doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or praise. No heroes, only the stench of failure."
</p>
<p>
And failure appears to be a theme central to C4. "What differentiates us from other RPGs out there," Ashilevi continued, "is failing forward. Instead of failure being something that makes the player trigger a reload, start save scumming, we make failure a joy in itself, validating the player choice where other games may deny it. This is something very unique to our games, and we all know nobody fails more often than spies."
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/C4_5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

 </a>
</figure>
</figure>
<p>
As to how all this will play out in more specific terms, that remains to be seen. For now, ZA/UM seems content to speak in more thematic terms, with C4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8">striking announcement trailer</a> being accompanied by Sianamäe's tease that "betrayal is only possible in the presence of love".
</p>
<p>
What the studio is willing to share, though, is a whole heap of influences it's drawing upon for its latest project, ranging from the spy fiction of John le Carré to the "weird" science fiction of Ursula K. Le Guin, Phillip K. Dick, and Stanisław Lem. Even Park Chan-wook and French TV drama Le Bureau get a mention, with Ashilevi noting the latter "really [captures] how normal civilians get entrapped or seduced into intelligence work, and how keeping secrets compounds for those members of humanity who do it professionally."
</p>
<p>
At the moment, there's no hint of a release date - or even target platforms - for C4, but ZA/UM says it'll be sharing more details during next week's Game Developer Conference.

<p>
C4 is the first game to emerge from ZA/UM since 2019's widely acclaimed Disco Elysium, and follows years of convoluted legal drama among executives and former members of the creative team. With at least some of that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">now said to be resolved</a>, and with different members of the original Disco Elysium team now scattered across the globe, multiple new projects have been announced by Disco Elysium alumni since October.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">announced his new Summer Eternal studio</a> in October, confirming it too is working on an RPG. And if you thought that was confusing, last year's barrage of announcements was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/messy-drama-behind-disco-elysiums-multiple-spiritual-successors-detailed-in-new-report">accompanied by yet more messy drama</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that's without factoring in what Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - who were both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct</a> - will do next. The pair have set up their own studio, Red Info, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase for this week, and it sounds like the show will focus pretty much exclusively on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami reveals that the stream will air on March 13th at 3pm Pacific, which is around 6pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT. It's going to be a fairly late one if you're in the UK or Europe.</p>

<p>According to the post, the stream will "uncover&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>", so presumably, we'll get a full reveal for the game. I'm not sure you should hold your breath for a release date, but at the very least we should get a full story reveal and perhaps some gameplay as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=otsaKKu5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=4fw1eN9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was first revealed back in late 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was revealed via a rather effectively creepy teaser trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in 2022</a>, but we don't know too much about the game outside of that initial reveal.</p>

<p>The trailer featured some pretty creepy imagery, including a Japanese-style doll and a girl covered in some kind of strange floral growth, but it's not clear yet how those things will fit into&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s story.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, Konami didn't forget about&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released late last year, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">over two million copies</a> at last count. It seems the game performed well enough to prompt Konami to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">work with Bloober on another game</a> based on one of the publisher's IPs, too.</p>

<p>You can rewatch the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>teaser trailer (or perhaps even watch it for the first time, if you missed it back in 2022) right here.</p>




<p>The next&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission will air on March 13th (that's this Thursday!) at 3pm Pacific. It's worth noting that Konami hasn't ruled out other franchise news, so we could well learn more about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>on Thursday as well.</p>

The passage of time is unfortunately an unstoppable thing, and I seem to have blinked and five years have passed since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. In the intervening period, a sort-of-sequel was released simply titled Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 - now just called Call of Duty: Warzone, too - and the single, bountiful map players War upon has changed several times over. Yesterday on March 10th, the day Warzone officially released back in 2020, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/activision">Activision</a> shared a teaser trailer confirming that the game's original map Verdansk will be making a comeback.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trailer, which you can check out below, is set to Nat King Cole's classic Unforgettable, all while different characters in a range of military gear lovingly look at dirt, embrace shot-up walls, and cry over the return of Verdansk.

<p>
To be honest, it feels like a bit of a tone deaf trailer given the general state of the world, but I suppose Call of Duty has never been known for treating these kinds of things sensitively. 
</p>
<p>
It was thought that season 3 of Warzone and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> would be arriving later this month on March 20th, but last week the official Call of Duty X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641">confirmed that it will instead be coming April 3rd</a>. That's when you'll be able to jump back into Verdansk, too.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is obviously following in Fortnite's footsteps here, given that Epic's more popular battle royale did the exact same thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-og-is-here-bringing-back-planes-hamster-balls-tilted-towers-and-more-over-the-next-four-weeks">back in 2023</a> by bringing back a whole bunch of features from the earliest iteration of the game, including its original map. Fortnite found a lot of success with that move, something I'm sure Activision will hope repeats with the return of Verdansk to Warzone.

Well, it’s something of a trick question, as the story mode is more of a prologue or tutorial for the grind to come!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,196394,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h29492"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></h2><p>If you’re the type to rush through a game’s story—and in the case of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, I don’t blame you one bit—then you can finish <em>Wilds </em>in approximately <strong>20 to 30 hours</strong>, give or take. That was easy, eh? The whole campaign is split into two parts, each taking 12 to 15 hours to tackle. But again, that’s just the story! It’s just the opening flourish of the game! There’s still a whole expansive world to explore, monsters to hunt, crafting and upgrades to explore, side quests and challenges to tackle, and of course, the ever-present grind the series is known for.</p><p>Then, of course, there are achievements to consider.

In <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Rise</em>, Master Rank offered additional challenges that made the game even more of a grind, more difficult to master, but offered players the opportunity to show off their hunting prowess. Currently, Master Rank isn’t available in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we won’t say ‘never.’ This top-tier rank didn’t release in the past two titles until post-launch expansions hit the scene. Therefore, we suspect <em>Wilds </em>will follow the same path!</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’re looking for your next fix of horror and hilarity, REPO might be what you need. The valuable-extraction title blends comedy and claustrophobic scares, and tackling it with more players is necessary if you want to sleep better.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> came along in late 2023 to stun the indie gaming community. It racked up a peak of nearly 250,000 players on Steam, and it still attracts thousands of players each month. Imitators have come and gone, trying to replicate its meteoric success, but REPO might be the one to crack the case.</p>



<p>It’s also an online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> where you need to “Locate valuable, fully physics-based objects and handle them with care,” according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and if you have a lot of friends, you might be pleased at how many people can join up and play REPO at any one time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-repo-in-online-co-op">How Many People Can Play REPO in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My face when the McDonald’s milkshake machine works. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Up to 6 players can team up and play REPO together in a party.</strong></p>



<p>This gives REPO a slight edge over Lethal Company’s four-player squads. It also means even more chaos and calamity can ensue. </p>



<p>One of the biggest differences about REPO is keeping the cargo safe. Dropping the valuables or bringing any harm to them will decrease their value. This reduces your earnings, and disappoints your creator greatly.</p>



<p>Given that you need to use voice chat to communicate with your allies and negotiate obstacles, enemies, and other ungodly hazards, having more teammates could go either way for your survival chances!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-repo-solo">Can You Play REPO Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play REPO solo, but if you’re not privy to the game’s contents, you’ll understand why that’s a bad idea.</strong></p>



<p>Teamwork is <em>key </em>in REPO. Again, the more players with you, the faster you’ll find loot, and the more decoys and human shields you have to take the brunt of enemy attacks—grim, but true. Solo survival in REPO is extremely difficult, and even the game’s official description suggests you should: “<strong>Use teamwork to make sure that the precious cargo will safely reach its destination</strong>.”</p>



<p>REPO may get tweaked to be more accommodating to solo players as time goes on. Conversely, REPO may get options to broaden the player pool for each lobby. We’ll update this guide if developer semiwork makes such changes.</p>



<hr>



<p>Indie horror games are a popular genre on Steam. REPO is a breakout hit already in 2025, so let us know if you get the chance to play it and what you think.</p>
