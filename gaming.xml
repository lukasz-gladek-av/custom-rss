			<p>Running games powered by the Unreal Engine 5.4 smoothly continues to be a challenge even for current high-end GPUs, as an RTX 4080 GPU has trouble running an undemanding fan-made game powered by the engine at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, <a href="https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3</a>, a fan-made project powered by the latest public version of the engine, cannot run at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Quality preset even in scenarios where there isn't a lot happening on screen. With other DLSS settings and Frame Generation, performance is considerably better, but this is only making it more clear that a native 4K, 60 FPS experience is not possible on the vast majority of current gaming hardware, although better optimization, which shouldn't be expected for a small fan-made project like this, could have improved the situation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3 on Unreal Engine 5.4 | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bs2XrBrpbBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One more thing the video above makes abundantly clear regarding Unreal Engine 5.4 is that, despite performance improvements over past versions, the engine still leaves plenty to be desired in regard to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame time stability</a>, as the stutters are pretty evident at all resolutions. This has been a persistent issue in games powered by Epic's engine for a long while, and there still doesn't seem to be a solution to the problem in sight, although things may improve in the future thanks to the effort of developers well-known for their technical expertise, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <p>The developers of hero shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.</p>

<p>Blizzard explained the ins and outs of Classic mode in <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">a rose-tinty post</a>. They also explain that this won't be the only time the mode appears (Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, likes to run limited-time events often). Each time the classic event shows up it will replicate the "heroes and balance from popular moments in the game’s history."</p>
<p>This time that means you can have a team composition of six Torbjorns, the turret-thwacking Swede. Or field a team made entirely of very annoying Genjis, the ninja who I hate. But be warned, this lack of hero limits only lasts the first few days, say Blizzard. "After that, we will enable single hero limits for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event." </p><p>Some things won't be changing, though. The maps that cycle through this mode will be the maps you recognise (Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and so on) but their design will remain as they appear in Overwatch 2. "This includes major reworks for Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar," say the devs.</p>
<p>The mode will run for the next three weeks, until December 2nd. And it's not related, we're told, to the chin-scratching at the studio regarding another possible 6v6 mode in Overwatch 2. That's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-may-get-6v6-again-as-blizzard-try-to-bring-back-the-chaotic-over-the-top-variety-of-the-first-game">something separate the studio is thinking about</a>. </p>
<p>Blizzard aren't the first to encourage players to become misty-eyed about a shooter they used to play. Last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-season-og-brought-back-its-original-map-last-week-and-a-record-breaking-44m-players-came-with-it">its old map</a>, resulting in record player numbers and likely catching the dollar-sign eyes of every executive in charge of a live service game. But harking back to some "golden age" of your favourite online blastabout is a questionable way to engage with nostalgia, as James learned when he had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> after they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">launched a similar classic mode</a>. As a a kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> holiday it was enjoyable, he said, "but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always <em>that</em> good."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft's shutdown of The Crew has sparked a legal challenge from two fans who have this month filed to begin a class action lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
Online racer The Crew became unplayable and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removed from owner's accounts</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft pulled the plug on its servers</a> back in March. The game was 10 years old and had been replaced by a successor, but Ubisoft's decision still sparked wider concern among video game fans increasingly concerned about preservation and consumer rights.
</p>
<p>
"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the plaintiff's lawyers wrote in the new lawsuit, as first reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>.

<p>
"Turns out the pinball manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned."
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit alleges that its plaintiffs - and likely many others - were unaware that legally they owned only a license to the software, even if they owned a physical copy, and would not have purchased the game if they had been aware of its eventual complete shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Its plaintiffs are now seeking approval for a wider class action lawsuit which could pay out for owners of the game.
</p>
<p>
"We announced on December 14, 2023 that after almost a decade of support, we would be decommissioning The Crew 1 on 31st March 2024," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer earlier this year. (The company has declined to comment on this new legal action.) 
</p>
<p>
"While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's decision helped spark the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to end the practice of publishers "destroying" video games after their sale to customers. 
</p>
<p>
379,280 people have since signed a petition to the EU that calls for measures to ensure games remain playable get legal backing - specifically, that games remain in a working state with an offline mode when publisher support does wind down.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft subsequently committed to providing offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>, which will be playable if (more likely, when) those games also get their servers switched off. 
</p>
<p>
While there's no suggestion game publishers will be required to keep online servers active forever, there does seem to be a greater acknowledgement that consumers lack awareness of what they are acquiring when buying a game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-only-buying-a-license-when-paying-for-a-game">Steam now warns customers they're only buying a license when paying for a game</a>, for example, as fresh California legislation requires storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">Eurogamer spoke to a group of The Crew fans taking matters into their own hands</a> by attempting to use mods to bring the game back online using private servers.

<p>The highly anticipated collaboration between the two games will launch on November 20th worldwide. At the center of this collaboration will be Emil, whose shop will make a surprise appearance in the world of Shift Up's game to offer players eleven different collaboration items.</p>
<p>A free Stellar Blade update will accompany the expansion's launch on November 20th, introducing the highly-requested photo mode, four new costumes that bring more personality to the game's characters, lip-syncing support for French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Latin America Spanish, the ability to listen to specific songs during a camp break, new customization options for Eve, which include a no ponytail option and some combat tweaks.

			<p>The easiest way to describe Redacted is ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> in a prison’. Whilst it’s true that the two games share many similarities – a Roguelike structure, an isometric viewpoint, and lovely comic book visuals – that lazy comparison does Redacted a disservice. Striking Distance Studios has made its own game, for better and for worse.</p>
<p><iframe title="[REDACTED] Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyQ44BJSDEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sharing a setting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/02/callisto-protocol-review-in-progress-is-it-better-than-dead-space/">The Callisto Protocol</a>, Redacted takes you to Black Iron Prison, a state-of-the-art penitentiary placed out of the way on Callisto, Jupiter’s rather chilly moon. The prison has become overrun with hordes of infected inmates, armies of militant mutants, and a conglomeration of other hideous beasties. You take on the role of a hapless prison guard, one who must blast, bash, and bludgeon their way to the last remaining escape pod and thus complete the game. Thing is, this being a Roguelike, you are not going to manage that for around 15 hours. Most of your time will be spent dying, getting incrementally more powerful, attempting another run, and then dying again. You know the drill.</p>


<p>First off, Redacted is gorgeous. The chunky, American comic book inspired visuals are absolutely my cup of tea. Bright, bold, punchy; the denizens of Black Iron are an unmitigated delight to maul and murder. Combat is fast and satisfying; the kick of a shotgun blast as it launches a slobbering zombie into an electric trap is unexpectedly meaty, particularly for a game played from an isometric viewpoint, which can often have a distancing effect on the action. Your prison guard can dash, back attack, and grenade launch in such a responsive and dynamic manner that even Zagreus would be impressed. In short, Redacted plays really nicely. Each self-enclosed arena is a Potpourri of intense chaotic violence that will get your heart pumping and your fingers twiddling with excitement.</p>


<p>Complete a room by killing all the enemies and you’ll be rewarded with a power-up, some of which will offer you a boost for your current run, while others provide you with new abilities, perks, and upgrades that will benefit you through this and every subsequent run. Your standard Roguelike, then.</p>
<p>Death comes frequently in the world of Redacted. A tad too frequently in my humble opinion. This is a <em>hard</em> game, offering a much steeper challenge than Hades. Whilst your prison guard consistently increases in power, the enemies you face match you every step of the way. It often frustratingly feels like you aren’t making much progress, the game cackling in delight as in throws ever more obstacles your way, ensuring you are stuck on the second stage for hours and hours before you finally break through to the next section. Progress can be frustratingly slow and irksome, rather than addictive and compelling.</p>

<p>Missing the iconic Greek gods of Hades, Redacted offers a smart alternative: you aren’t on your own in attempting to reach the last escape pod and other employees and inmates are racing against you. There’s some fabulously over-the-top voiced characters to encounter, though the RPG obsessed super nerd, a lewd dinner lady, and a symbiote infected hapless admin guy, are the stand outs. Your rivals will mock you or occasionally offer you tips during your run, and they’re even able to attack you remotely – adding exploding enemies to a room or foes that have increased freeze damage, that kind of thing. In the reverse, you’ll gather and charge power-ups – input through a QTE – to slow your rivals down, weaken them, or expose vulnerabilities. Catch up with them in an arena and you’ll have an epic boss battle on your hands, survive and you’ll unlock dossiers that will further weaken your rival until they can eventually be defeated.</p>
<p>It’s an addictive gameplay loop, one that will keep you hankering after just one more run, even if the slow progress elsewhere might have you chewing on your controller with rage. Not that that happed to me. Honest.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Redacted ain't no lazy Hades clone, instead it offers an experience that is unique amongst the crowded Roguelike genre. Put up with the steep difficulty and slow progress and you’ll experience an immensely enjoyable game, one that is cram-packed with slick combat and brilliant characters.	</p></div>

        <p>The servers were taken offline in March, rendering the online-only game unplayable</p>

            <p>"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed". As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>, that's an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>. They're suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game's</a> servers, rendering it unplayable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft pulled the ol’ snippy Johnson on The Crew’s server wires <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">back in March</a>, effectively killing the online-only game. The following month, it started <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">disappearing from owner's</a> Ubisoft Connect libraries. In response, YouTuber Ross Scott started a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Stop Killing Games</a> initiative, petitioning France's Directorate General For Competition, Consumer Affairs And Fraud Protection (DGCCRF) to investigate.</p>
<p>Ubisoft - perhaps rightly terrified of a protracted skirmish with a man who owns two first names - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">confirmed an offline mode in September</a> for sequels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>. The Crew itself, however, remains unplayable. As Polygon note, Ubisoft did offer full refunds to those who had "recently" bought The Crew when they first announced the server shutdown, but since the game came out in 2011, this excluded many.</p>

<p>The lawsuit itself takes the above pinball allusion and runs with it, saying this chillingly paddle-deprived thought experiment is "exactly" what happened with the game’s server shutdowns. Both plaintiffs own physical copies, which the lawsuit says they wouldn’t have bought "on the same terms" (price) knowing the servers could be shuttered, rendering the game unplayable. The lawsuit also cites, among others, several of Ubisoft’s titles that have shut down servers but patched in an offline mode, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> and 3. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p><p>In October, Graham wrote about an update to Steam that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">warns customers at checkout</a> that they're only buying a digital license to a game. The change, implemented internationally, was in response to new California legislation designed to more clearly inform players that a digital purchase doesn’t necessarily equate to permanent ownership. GOG, who are themselves exempt from the legislation because of their DRM-free offerings, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">couldn’t resist a cheeky pop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lots of Rainbow Six style a-breachin' and a-clearin' going on in that trailer there. We see blast charges, silencers, and one player using a big handheld battering ram to bust down a door while another tosses what's probably a flashbang over the threshold. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Steam page</a> calls it "high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning" with "tough, unyielding enemies". </p>
<p>It also says maps will be "reshaped" with every playthrough by something called a "Parametric Design System". Big word, that, parametric. Luckily, I am immune to big words. It is a fancy way of saying the maps (a mall, an office, etc) will feature some amount of randomness. But whether that's enemies, layout, objects - or something else - we're not told. Whatever it is, they promise variety, which will be important if we're to be SWATing it through dangerous corridors. Imagine checking the same corner twice, yuck.</p><p>It sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready Or Not</a>, a hardcore tactical co-op shooter that's all about storming rooms full of bad guys with hostages and the like. The multplayer shooter is an interesting route for Crowbar Collective to go following their recreation of Black Mesa, but it also makes some sense, given that the reworked weaponry animations were a big strength of Gordon's Great Gallivant, an adventure Graham called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-review-2">"the most impressive fan game ever made"</a>. Personally, I need a little more than "co-op roguelite shooter" to get excited about guns. But different strokes for militant folks and all that.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is being published by Team 17 and has a loose early access release date of 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Just before the release of Dragon's Dogma 2 in March, franchise creator Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-wants-to-make-something-new-after-dragons-dogma-2-which-is-as-long-as-the-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to make something wholly new and original for his next project. Fans certainly thought he meant at CAPCOM, but the veteran game director surprisingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> the Japanese company at the end of August after a career of thirty years. His credits at CAPCOM also include Power Stone, Auto Modellista, and multiple Devil May Cry games, including the critically acclaimed latest entry.</p>
<p>Today, we finally learned what's next for the maker of Dragon's Dogma 2. Tencent's LightSpeed Studios <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1856139854574432387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Itsuno is the new Head of their Japan Studio. He'll work on triple-A action games. The latter is no surprise, as that's what Itsuno has done for most of his career, though the same can't be said for choosing LightSpeed, which is not a household name in the industry yet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, LightSpeed is gathering momentum to achieve great things. Two and a half years ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-to-jin-yong-is-an-upcoming-ue5-aaa-open-world-game-from-tencents-lightspeed-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> off Code: To Jin Yong, an impressive-looking open world roleplaying game made with Unreal Engine 5 and set in a Wuxia-inspired world. While we haven't heard more info on this game since that reveal, another LightSpeed team based in Los Angeles <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-sentinel-is-a-gorgeous-open-world-game-set-in-dystopian-sci-fi-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> an equally gorgeous open world game called Last Sentinel during last year's The Game Awards. This one will be set in a dystopian sci-fi version of Tokyo. A few months ago, LightSpeed LA also <a href="https://wccftech.com/lightspeed-studios-unveils-new-performance-capture-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new state-of-the-art performance capture facility, showing that budget isn't too much of an issue at this stage.</p>
<p>Based on the news announcement, it sounds like Itsuno will be coordinating the efforts of the global teams, but that doesn't mean he won't eventually create a new project of his own. Personally, I'd love it if he would gather feedback about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2's shortcomings</a> and try to improve upon the formula, which had definitely stagnated quite a bit in the sequel, in a spiritual successor.</p>

In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We will absolutely see plenty more Nintendo Switch games on sale as we approach <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-facing-a-class-action-lawsuit-for-shutting-down-the-crew.1033254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for The Crew in March 2024, and this decision has not been well received by the community. While fans understood the removal of the multiplayer aspect of the game, they were frustrated that the single-player mode was also made inaccessible. Now, fans have filed a lawsuit against the publishers for failing to provide an offline mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/790913960/Crew-Lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court document</a> reveals that plaintiffs Matthew Cassel and Alan Liu have brought this class action against Ubisoft Entertainment S.A. and Ubisoft, Inc. on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly situated” for shutting down The Crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have accused Ubisoft of duping them in several ways. Firstly, they stated that Ubisoft “misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access a game.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged that Ubisoft “omitted material facts from the packaging and marketing” of The Crew. It was stated that Ubisoft didn’t mention that The Crew’s servers could be shut down at any point “without providing, at a minimum, an offline mode for consumers to continue to access the game they paid for”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, they bought physical discs, believing “The Crew itself was encoded onto physical disks consumers could buy or the digital files consumers could pay to download.” Instead, the game was on a remote server, and the physical disc acted as a key to access this server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs stated that when they purchased The Crew’s physical discs, they believed the game would be playable indefinitely without the risk of it being disabled. They also gave examples stating that Ubisoft had shut down online servers for games like Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed 3, and more in the past, but it patched an offline mode later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the case of The Crew, even after the community backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, stating that offline features of other games from the Crew franchise (The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest) would be preserved. But the original The Crew was left out of the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have demanded a trial by jury and “the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class are in excess of $5,000,000.00, exclusive of interest and cost” as this is a class-action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a group of modders have announced their commitment to resurrect The Crew. Also, Rainbow Six Siege made more money than any other Ubisoft franchise.

While it is an older model, it's still a versatile option in 2024. It includes two HDMI ports, a USB connection, and a coaxial digital port. If you have a DVD collection, you can also use an optional upscaling tool to make them look sharper, although they can look a bit rough around the jagged edges depending on the film (and your TV).</p><p dir="ltr">Blu-ray players are certainly niche tech products these days, but they can be worth the investment. If your favorite movie or TV show is available on 4K Blu-ray, there's a good chance this version offers the best experience from both a visual and audio perspective, even if it's also available to stream in 4K. This is because 4K discs can offer higher bitrates, while streaming services aim for smaller file sizes, which ultimately impacts video and audio quality.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, everyone uses streaming services these days, and the UBP-X700 is a smart Blu-ray player with access to all of the popular streaming apps. The nice thing about this if you're looking to have a dedicated Blu-ray player in the house, this is a much more affordable option when compared to something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim</a> or Xbox Series X, as those game consoles regularly cost $500.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-pubg-mobile-ranks-how-to-get-conqueror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that PUBG Mobile is just as popular as its console version, PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game also has its very own ranked mode, which has a large number of players competing to climb through the system every day. But how easy is it to rank up in PUBG Mobile? Here is a list of all the PUBG Mobile ranks and how you can rank up to the top.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-ranks">All PUBG Mobile Ranks</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile has its own set of ranks just like any other competitive game. However, a few of the game’s ranks are a bit different than the average shooter Battle Royale. </p>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> (III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Crown</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Ace</strong></li>



<li><strong>Conqueror</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PUBG Mobile’s final rank, Conqueror, is made up of the top 500 players in the server you play on, making it incredibly hard to reach. So, how does some a player get to Conqueror?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-conqueror-in-pubg-mobile">How to Get Conqueror in PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>Ranking up in PUBG Mobile, like any other Battle Royale, relies heavily on placement points. The longer you stay alive in a match, the more points you earn. Obviously, if you win a game, you will earn the most points. </p>



<p>But placement is not the only way to climb the ranks in PUBG Mobile. Kills are an essential aspect of ranking up in the game, as the more kills you get in a game the more points you end up with. </p>



<p>Even looting and getting assists will help you rank up in PUBG Mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-to-rank-up">Points Needed to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to move up a rank in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> Below 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1999</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2499</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Crown:</strong> 3700 – 4199</li>



<li><strong>Ace:</strong> 4200 – 4699</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Conqueror in PUBG Mobile?</p>

"Once we're out, we're out," a spokesperson said. Valve also confirmed that it has set aside stock "proportionally" across each region where the system will be available. To be able to buy one of the new Steam Decks, users have to have made a purchase on Steam before November 2024 and be in "good standing" with the company. Valve is limiting orders to one unit per account.</p><p>The new Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White will be available in the US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Australia, as well as Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.</p><p>Around this time last year, Valve launched a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-preorders-go-live-next-week/1100-6519053/" data-ref-id="1100-6519053">translucent Steam Deck OLED</a> as an "experiment" of sorts to see if people would be interested in different colors. Valve said the answer was a resounding yes, and that's why the white version is now on the way. For the translucent OLED model in 2023, it only shipped in select regions (the US and Canada). But the new white edition will ship everywhere Steam Deck does.</p><p>"We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new color variants down the line," Valve said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1347260683" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Halo Infinite in order from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Onyx</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Progressing through the ranks listed above is a bit different of a system compared to other games. Let’s break it down.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-through-halo-infinite-ranks-and-hit-hero">How to Progress through Halo Infinite Ranks and Hit Hero</h2>



<p>Hitting Hero in Halo Infinite is no easy feat. There are quite a few different ranks you have to climb through before getting there. Each main rank is broken up into the following smaller ranks. Below is a list from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cadet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Private</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lance Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gunnery Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Captain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lt. Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brigadier General</strong></li>



<li><strong>General</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s Military-styled system applies to all ranks except Recruit and Hero. To hit Hero, you must climb through the entire ranking system. To do so, all you have to do is play the game’s Ranked mode. </p>



<p>Losses will push you back in rank while wins and high-kill games will skyrocket you forward. Every player’s rank is also showcased on their individual profile, letting other players know just how good they actually are at the game.</p>



<p>Special events, like Double XP, do not count towards your rank progression, however. What’s even more interesting, is one’s rank does not apply skill-based matchmaking. You will be playing with random ranks as you progress through the game’s levels.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time.1033098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – which is like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> but better in almost every way – is getting a new, if potentially more smudge-susceptible Limited Edition. A successor to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-out-now-and-ready-to-ship-immediately">translucent version</a> that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The white-and-grey makeover will set you back £599 / $679 / €719, so it’s a few notes more than the 1TB Steam Deck OLED it’s functionally identical to. But you would get the <em>exclusive</em> ability to protect your Deck from thieves by camouflaging it against a stack of printer paper, or to pair it more effectively with a boat-ready pair of summer chinos. It’s bundled with a white carrying case, too.</p>

<p>All the same, I’m probably not gonna go for this. Besides being perfectly happy with my bog-standard, goth-shaded Steam Deck OLED, I’d immediately develop a deep paranoia over marks, scuffs, and melted chocolate stains blemishing that pristine exterior. But if you’re the sort that thinks all consumer electronics should look like the iPod, it’s there, albeit temporarily. Limited means limited in this case, and once the initial round of stock sells out, it’s gone forever. Better be ready at 3pm PST / 11pm GMT on the 18th to grab one when they launch.</p><p>If you do end up missing out, take comfort in knowing that a successful Limited Edition White could lead to more vibrant Steam Deck recolours in the future. “We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line,” said Valve comms chief Kaci Aitchison Boyle in a statement.</p>

<p>Said missive also confirmed that Valve are involved with "ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">other hardware plans</a>", though you can probably expect new colours for the existing models before a full-on Steam Deck 2. That’s still not coming for some time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-wont-sacrifice-battery-life-to-deliver-a-more-powerful-steam-deck-2">according to Valve’s engineers</a>, who want to “wait for a generational leap” in computing performance before committing to a whole new handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, some of the devs behind that project are making something completely new and unrelated to <em>Half-Life</em>. It’s called <em>Rogue Point</em> and it’s a tactical co-op shooter with roguelite elements. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,196131,195371" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mesa-the-kotaku-review-5944812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mesa-the-kotaku-review-5944812">First released in 2012</a></span> after years of development,<em> Black Mesa</em> was initially a free-to-download mod that recreated most of <em>Half-Life </em>using the more powerful Source engine. The game was developed by a large group of fan modders known as the Crowbar Collective. In 2015, the team released a paid version of the mod after getting approval from Valve. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/black-mesa/definitive-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/black-mesa/definitive-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finally, in 2020</a></span>, the game was updated to include all of the Xen levels and other improvements.

Each run is different and  dynamically generated using a mix of hand-built assets and randomly selected elements, according to an answer from a developer on Reddit. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RoguePoint/comments/1goui5y/crowbar_collective_ama_all_about_rogue_point/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoguePoint/comments/1goui5y/crowbar_collective_ama_all_about_rogue_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That AMA also revealed</a></span> that the game will support solo players and offline play.<em> Rogue Point </em>is being developed using Unreal Engine 4. As players complete missions and progress through a run, they’ll unlock new skills and evolve their operator, similar to progression systems in other rogue-lite games.</p><p>“Just like <em>Black Mesa</em>, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of <em>Black Mesa</em><strong> </strong>and having Team 17 as a partner for <em>Rogue Point </em>helps us focus on development and community feedback,” said Crowbar Collective CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels. </p><p>“We cannot wait to go in-depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full-time development studio.”</p><p>No specific release date was given for <em>Rogue Point</em>’s Early Access release. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can wishlist the game on Steam</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
