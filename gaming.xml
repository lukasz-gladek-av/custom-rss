            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered</a> Blue Protocol, the stylized online action RPG developed by Bandai Namco Online, nearly five years ago. Back then, there was no assurance the game would ever launch in Western countries.</p>
<p>That changed in December 2022, when Amazon Games took the stage at The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a publishing deal with Bandai Namco Online to bring the game to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-to-launch-on-pc-first-in-japan-may-support-cross-play-additional-features-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut</a> in the Land of the Rising Sun on June 14, 2023. The Western version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-mmorpg-gets-delayed-to-2024-in-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed to 2024</a>, but we haven't really heard any more about it. In fact, Amazon Games continued to mention its publishing deal with NCSoft for Throne and Liberty (<a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on September 17</a> in Western countries) in its press releases, whereas Blue Protocol wasn't mentioned any longer. The last blog post on the official global website is dated November 13, 2023.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that may be due to a dire financial situation. A few days ago, Bandai Namco Online (a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Entertainment) <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/388005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> itself insolvent due to substantial losses. That doesn't necessarily mean work on the game is about to stop, but it doesn't incite faith in its future, either.</p>
<p>The developers held a live stream earlier this month, but it didn't provide any news on the global launch. They only talked about upcoming updates, such as the next chapter in the main story, a new region, an increased level cap to 80, and new passive abilities for each class available in Blue Protocol.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the news from Japan, hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/24/24183179/netflix-new-tv-bear-season-3-babylon-berlin-4-iwtv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yugZzI">The days are officially getting shorter, but there is no less TV to watch — just take it from this week’s new releases. We’re running the gamut from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160862/dropout-make-some-noise-season-3-ben-schwartz">Dropout’s <em>Make Some Noise</em> season 3</a> to Netflix’s dynamic <em>Supacell</em>,<em> </em>all the way to the finales of <em>Dark Matter</em> season 1 and <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> season 2. Personally I’m most invested this week in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852870/babylon-berlin-season-4-netflix-release-date-when-us">return of <em>Babylon Berlin</em></a><em>, </em>which has switched from Netflix to a new network (more on that below). Thank god you watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23947308"><em>House of the Dragon</em>’s latest episode</a> live last night, huh? </p>
<p id="LleI9C">Here’s all the new TV premieres and finales this week. </p>

<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superheroes (grounded)<br><strong>Release date: </strong>June 27, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Rapman<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tosin Cole, Adelayo Adedayo, Yasmin Monet Prince, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR">There’s not a lot in this world that can beat “superhero fatigue,” but Rapman’s <em>Supacell</em> hopes to do so by embracing normal people getting superpowers, “not people that are martyrs, not people that are going to save the world, just people that try to save themselves and their families,” as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/superhero-shows/netflix-supacell-misfits-heroes-exclusive/">he told SFX magazine</a>. </p>
<p id="HoNmjo">And indeed his premise is more complicated than it seems: five people in South London getting powers out of nowhere — and having nothing that seems to link them beyond being Black — with a nefarious organization lurking the background. </p>

<p id="bwwhbU">Lots of ground has been covered this season — Louis (Sam Reid) and Claudia (Bailey Bass) finding their way to Paris; Armand (Assad Zaman) revealing his and Louis’ present-day love and their meet-cute; Daniel (Eric Bogosian) getting fed up of vampire antics.

<p>When Ubisoft officially unveiled the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition last week, many fans immediately brought up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. </p>



<p>The game was first announced in 2016, and has since been in development hell. It has seen multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restarts and management changes</a> that has led many fans to just assume that it’s not coming. However, Ubisoft confirmed on Monday that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still on the way.</p>



<p>“Yes, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade’s past in the 20th Anniversary Edition,” the studio said <a href="https://x.com/bgegame/status/1805269728262230467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the game’s official Twitter</a> account. </p>



<p>Obviously a simple post like that doesn’t answer any major questions about the state of the game. That said, it’s at least something to know that it hasn’t been abandoned after a decade in development. When fans will hear anything more about the prequel title remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary launches on June 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>The developers of multiplayer aerial combat sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a> have apologised after a picture of the real-life Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which killed seven crew members when it exploded just 73 seconds after launch in 1986, was used in artwork promoting the game’s recent Seek &amp; Destroy update.</p>

<p>Similarities between the unmistakable photo of the explosion, which was broadcast live in many American schools due to the presence of teacher Christa McAuliffe on board, and a section of the key art for War Thunder’s <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/8953-meet-major-update-seek-destroy-en">new Seek &amp; Destroy update</a> were spotted by a number of players, several of whom took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the game’s subreddit</a> and forums to criticise the poor taste of using imagery of the real-life disaster to promote a video game.</p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment community manager magazine2 subsequently <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/26">posted a response</a> expressing “sincere apologies” on behalf of the devs for the “accidental” use of the imagery, saying that “the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost”.</p>
<p>“We’ll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn’t repeat again in the future,” they added.</p>
<p>“Things like this shouldn't happen and we'll make sure it doesn't repeat,” another community manager, Oxy, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/comment/l9vr7e0/">posted on Reddit</a> while repeating the claim that the use was due to the accidental use of the explosion reference pack. They stated that that the artwork would be revised today, Monday June 24th. At the time of writing, the distinctive explosion can still be seen in a thumbnail for <a href="https://youtu.be/DIsdWN78JS4">the update’s rundown video</a> and a <a href="https://staticfiles.warthunder.com/upload/image/0_Wallpaper_Renders/Aircraft/1920x1080_seek_and_destroy_logo_eng_7d40f0ff1f7fc2ef0a2542ea5a3aba6b.jpg">downloadable wallpaper of the art</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that War Thunder has made headlines due to its controversial connections to real life, though usually it's a little more humourous than re-using imagery of a tragic disaster. Dedicated players have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-posts-classified-document-to-prove-tank-is-inaccurate">posting classified documents to prove the inaccuracy of some of its vehicles</a> in the past, with the not-irregular leaking of secretive military intel on its forums to one-up rival players and argue about how closely it simulates actual hardware becoming somewhat of a running joke at this point.</p>

It’s a sentiment shared by many. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994292464/recommended/2778580/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994292464/recommended/2778580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another reviewer</a></span> said that FromSoftware has “lost the essence of what made their games fun—fairness.” They are referring to the idea that most Soulslikes give players the skills to overcome challenges, but claim <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> lacks that balance in combat encounters. The review-bombing and overall discussion of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s difficulty has revived a conversation around Soulslikes as old as the games themselves: Are these games too difficult, or are people just too used to handholding in modern games to appreciate a real challenge?</p><figure id="" data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In opposition to the review bombers, and other players who are genuinely dissatisfied with the difficulty, some are saying that this is just how FromSoftware rolls. That is true, to an extent, as the studio has a track record of making DLC for its games that are harder than the base game. These expansions are meant as a higher challenge for those who have mastered what came before. This was also the case, for example, with <em>Bloodborne</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464"><em>The Old Hunters</em></a></span> DLC (which, in my opinion, remains one of the most challenging experiences FromSoft has made). There is an element of “what did you expect?” from some, aimed at those complaining about the extreme difficulty.<br></p><p>However, the situation is a bit more complex than that. The discussion of FromSoftware difficulty has always had two sides to it. Many people often think of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">Git Gud</a></span>” crowd, who don’t want to have nuanced discussions and think players complaining just need to be better. But on the other side, there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023">valid criticisms</a></span> of FromSoftware’s difficulty, especially with respect to the lack of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475">accessibility options</a></span>. This has continued to be a pain point, as it means these games are less available to all players. Furthermore, FromSoftware’s design ethos often demands a high level of perfection, while the games themselves are filled with imperfect designs (such as wonky camera controls) that cause unintended friction the player must also surmount.</p><p>There is yet another layer to the conversation around <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> is arguably the most accessible (and therefore most played by newcomers) game FromSoft has designed to date. The open world is a big reason for that, as players who encounter a challenge they can’t defeat can just go somewhere else. That more accessible design and the popularity it gained created a community of players who have never played a Soulslike before, and are now excitedly diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> only to discover FromSoft DLC is hard as hell.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This difficulty shock is likely to cause an uproar in disappointment at the perception of an extremely unfair challenge. With so much discussion going on, even <em>Elden Ring</em> publisher Bandai Namco weighed in. “This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on X (formerly Twitter), to urge those complaining about the difficulty to use the expansion’s new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790">upgrade material</a></span>. This highlights another fact of FromSoftware: The developer (almost) always gives players a way to tackle new challenges.<br></p><p>So is <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> too hard? Well, it’s complicated. It is definitely harder than <em>Elden Ring</em>, but there are also ways to deal with the greater challenge. If you are having a hard time with any of the new bosses, take your time, take a break, and you really should collect as many Scadutree Fragments as you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed%E2%80%99s-game-length-will-be-%E2%80%98similar%E2%80%99-to-the-outer-worlds.909951/</guid>

<p>Avowed, an upcoming open-world RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, promises an immersive gaming experience. During the Xbox Game Showcase earlier this month, players were treated to a new gameplay trailer that showcased intense combat sequences, a vast and diverse map, and a rich fantasy world. Now, Avowed’s game directors have also informed us about the game length and it is ‘similar’ to their previous project, ‘The Outer Worlds’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fair-distance">Fair Distance</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/20/avoweds-creators-on-why-romance-was-considered-but-ultimately-not-included-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Avowed gameplay directors Carrie Patel and Gabe Paramo shared intriguing details about the game. They discussed the third-person option, the game’s RPG systems, interactions with other characters, and more. When asked about the game’s length, the directors drew a reassuring comparison to Obsidian’s action RPG from 2019, The Outer Worlds, suggesting that Avowed will offer a similarly substantial experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykgkdU1NJUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Patel stated that the “best comparison for Avowed in terms of scope is The Outer Worlds”. She clarified that while Avowed will offer a similar level of depth and content, it will also provide a unique experience. </p>



<p>The game’s length may vary according to the difficulty players choose and the time they want to invest in exploration and side missions compared to the main storyline. According to How Long to Beat, The Outer Worlds’ main story takes around 13 and a half hours, main plus side missions take more than 27 and a half hours, and completionist runs take around 42 hours. This suggests that Avowed will offer substantial content for players to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other Avowed news, the developers recently hinted at the game’s release date, suggesting a possible window in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 2024</a>. However, it’s important to note that this is a leaked date and has not been officially confirmed. For more information on whether Avowed is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-avowed-coming-to-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a>, click here. We’re curious to hear your thoughts on Avowed’s game length. Do you think it sounds sufficient, or would you prefer more or less content? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

Oil fields are primarily located on the new Sakurajima Island, so you'll likely have to establish a new base there if you want to produce Crude Oil. However, small oil mounds can be found all over the original map as well, but they aren't clearly marked. If you open your map and view Sakurajima Island, you'll see some black spots at various spots. These black spots indicate where oil fields are located, so you have to make your base near one of them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973"></a><figcaption>Oil fields are marked by dark spots on the Sakurajima map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png"></figure><p>When you get to one of these dark spots on the map, build a Pal Management Box to establish a base. Then, find a lifted mound in the ground with dark sludge coming out of it. This dark sludge is oil, and it's where you need to place the Crude Oil Extractor. Using the materials you gathered earlier, go into your build menu, view the second page of the "Production" tab, and find the Crude Oil Extractor. Build the extractor right over the oil mound in the ground. Once that's done, you're ready to start harvesting some Crude Oil.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027"></a><figcaption>Building the Crude Oil Extractor over the oil mound. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png"></figure><h2>Producing Crude Oil in Palworld</h2><p>While you might think Crude Oil will just start pouring out of the extractor after you build it, Palworld has other plans. The Crude Oil Extractor requires a power source to operate, so you'll have to construct a Power Generator near the extractor in your new base. The Power Generator can be built from the "Infrastructure" tab of the build menu and costs the following resources:</p><ul><li>50 Ingots</li><li>20 Electric Organs</li></ul><p>Once the Power Generator is up and running, you need to head into your Pal Management Box and assign an Electric Pal to the generator. Using a Pal with level 3 or 4 Electricity Work Suitability is essential, as the Crude Oil Extractor requires a ton of power. A level 2 Electricity Pal won't be able to power the generator fully.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029"></a><figcaption>Powering up the Crude Oil Extractor. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png"></figure><p>Ensure your Electric Pal is assigned to the Power Generator, which is indicated by the Pal producing electricity near the generator. After that happens, the Power Generator will start storing power and the Crude Oil Extractor should turn on. You'll know if the extractor is working if you hear noises coming from it.</p><p>You can collect Crude Oil from the extractor by going up to it and pressing "Acquire" if one or more Crude Oils Are produced. It's recommended that you have a Transport Pal at your new base so they can take the Crude Oil from the extractor to a storage chest, so you don't have to do that yourself.</p><p>With your new Crude Oil, you can make Plasteel at an Electric Furnace or craft items such as Missile Ammo, Flamethrower Fuel, or other Technology menu unlocks.</p>

You shouldn't have too much trouble putting it together either, as it clocks in at just 350 pieces. The building kit is officially licensed by The Pokemon Company, meaning you're getting an authentic replica of the iconic Pokedex. What makes the kit even more exciting is the five included lenticular cards of Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and Eevee, allowing you to personalize your Pokedex's appearance.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>As if that weren't enough, you'll find a light brick that can be pressed to illuminate your Pokedex and gives it a cool interactive feature.</p><p>Depending on your location, you can pick up your Pokedex in-store today. Alternatively, you can have it set up for delivery or shipping. Most locations are selling out fast (my local store only has four left), and if the sold-out listing at Amazon is any indication, Target's inventory could be gone soon.</p><p>Whether you miss out on this Pokedex offer or want to build a well-rounded Pokemon Mega Bloks collection, there are a bunch of other great building kits to peruse.

            <p>The Terra Nil team has released its first major update, known as Vita Nova, across PC and Netflix. A Switch version is also on its way.</p>
<p>Today's update for the environmental strategy game is free, and includes a number of new levels, such as Polluted Bay and Scorched Caldera. </p>
<p>The Terra Nil team describe Polluted Bay as a "dead landscape carved in half by a badly polluted river". Scorched Caldera, on the other hand, is a "vast volcanic crater that you must terraform into a life-filled freshwater lake". </p>

<p>In addition to new levels, Vita Nova has brought improvements to the map, with the developer stating that along with being 3D, it can now be freely rotated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team said the overhauled wildlife system - which it describes as "dramatic" - will allow the transformed landscapes to "feel more alive than ever". This means animals such as the newly introduced jaguar will venture out more naturally, and have "a deeper set of needs to fulfil". </p>
<p>Nine new buildings have also been added to the game thanks to this update. You can check out a trailer for Vita Nova in the video above.</p>

<p>"Even where Terra Nil makes choices I don't always enjoy, I enjoy that it does make these novel, ambitious choices," Ruth Cassidy wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terra-nil-review-an-intricate-ecosystem-of-puzzles">Eurogamer's Terra Nil review</a>.</p>
<p>"More than simply the gentle vibes it seems to suggest on the surface, Terra Nil offers engaging puzzles, a thorough commitment to what an environmental city builder could look like, and lingering moments of actual perfection."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184700/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-gaming-headset-tapo-mini-smart-plugs-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve run through an alarming number of gaming headsets over the years from almost every brand you can think of — including Razer, Turtle Beach, HyperX, Logitech, and Corsair — but none impressed me more than SteelSeries’. Its latest high-end set is the <strong>Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</strong>, and while not cheap, you can get a refurbished model at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headset">Woot</a> until the end of June with a 90-day warranty for $179.99 ($170 off the MSRP).</p><p>SteelSeries headsets are widely lauded for their comfort, well-balanced audio, great mic quality, and sleek design. You can get most of these benefits from the brand’s more affordable options since they typically use similar drivers and microphones, but the Nova Pro Wireless is ideal for multiplatform gamers. Its dual USB base allows you to connect it to both your PC and PlayStation 5 (another <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=theverge02-20">version specifically supports Xbox</a>, but there’s no equivalent sale right now), and it features Bluetooth support for the Nintendo Switch and various mobile devices. You can even use a USB source and Bluetooth simultaneously. </p><p>The base station has a monochromatic OLED display that makes it easy to see which mode you’re in, manage volume levels and chat mix, and fiddle with the EQ, all of which you can control from the headset if you don’t feel like getting up to use the knob. That’s also where you’ll charge the spare battery it comes with, which I personally think is the secondary killer feature. You can pop the removable battery out and swap in a fresh one from the base — no tethering required.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">Read our SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset supports active noise cancellation, swappable batteries, Bluetooth support, and compatibility with PC and most consoles — including Switch and PlayStation. This model includes a base station that makes it easy to toggle crucial sound settings. </p></div><p><h3>A few more deals to start the week</h3></p><div><ul><li>You can snag a copy of <em><strong>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</strong></em> for the PS4 / PS5 and Xbox Series X / S for $39.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmwWBw5c86N">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Flike-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-launch-edition---playstation-5%2F401448.html">GameStop</a>. <em>Infinite Wealth</em> picks up on main character Ichiban Kasuga’s whereabouts across Hawaii directly after the events of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon.</em> Unlike the traditional action gameplay from the <em>Yakuza</em> series, the<em> </em>combat here is mostly turn-based in nature, with some subtle action elements that can turn the tides of your fights depending on your approach. There’s a rich story and a ton to do outside of its engaging combat, too, whether you’re running up the scoreboards at arcades, singing a round of karaoke, or putting in extra hours on the fun jobs you can take. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055072/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-yakuza-sega">Read our review</a>.</li><li>A three-pack of <strong>TP-Link’s Matter-ready Tapo Mini Smart Wi-Fi Plugs </strong>is available for just $24.99 ($25 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXMNJDW3?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.store.tp-link.com%2Fproducts%2Ftp-link-tapo-matter-compatible-smart-plug-mini-15a-1800w-tapo-p125m%3Fvariant%3D44382110286047">TP-Link</a>, which matches its all-time low. Smart plugs are ideal if you’re starting a smart home makeover, as they allow you to remotely schedule and control the power on older devices plugged in to them. Their support for the newer Matter protocol also means they offer seamless control from your preferred smart home platform, whether that’s Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599437/tp-link-tapo-p125m-review-matter-apple-amazon-google-smartthings">Read our review</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868860/blue-yeti-x-usb-microphone-live-streamers-blend-led-metering"><strong>Blue Yeti X</strong></a> is down to $129.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QKQJL17?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmwWttm3MoQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBlue-Yeti-X-Professional-USB-Condenser-Microphone-PC-Mac-Gaming-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-Desktop-Mic-High-Res-Metering-LED-Lighting-VO-CE-Effec%2F286303156">Walmart</a>. Although there are more attractive options with more impressive acoustics, the Logitech-owned Blue microphones are solid for podcasting, music, and content creation. They can be a little sensitive, and you may find it a challenge to dial in the perfect gain, but it’s easier to find that sweet spot on the Yeti X thanks to a built-in LED gain meter. Its multifunction knob lets you adjust levels, mute the mic, and set your preferred polar pickup pattern. You can also engage other helpful features, such as a “blend” mode that helps you find an ideal balance between your voice and whichever audio source you’re speaking over.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-officially-ditch-fifa-and-will-rename-the-series-ea-sports-fc-from-next-year">end of EA’s decades-long FIFA deal in 2022</a> means there’s currently a FIFA-shaped hole in the world of video games that isn’t quite filled by EA’s not-FIFA replacement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc24">EA Sports FC 24</a> and is yet to measure up the efforts of whoever the footballing organisation gets to make the next officially licensed FIFA game. So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>.</p>

<p>The Rocket League World Cup will run later this year as part of FIFA’s wider ‘FIFAe’ effort to break into the world of esports, which their website tells me they’ve been attempting to do since a FIFA Interactive World Cup held in 2004. Nowadays that consists of online competitions played across EA Sports FC, Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/efootball-2024">eFootball</a> and Rocket League, which already runs its Championship Series through the initiative.</p>
<p>The upcoming World Cup will see 16 nations face off in a global tournament, with each country able to put forward three players and one substitute as their representatives on the pitch. The participating nations will be selected through a combination of their player base - in other words, how many people play Rocket League - and based on the past performance of their fellow local players in Rocket League competitions. Those countries will also have the chance to run local-level tournaments to help find their nation’s top players.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>“The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA’s member associations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles,” FIFA’s director of eFootball and gaming Christian Volk said in a statement that, despite their job title, really reads like someone who had never heard of Rocket League before someone burst into their office and pointed at a big number. Volk topped off that statement with one of the most teeth-grinding corporate taglines I’ve come across in a while: “This milestone partnership highlights our commitment to evolve our football esports ecosystem and continue to build the biggest stages for all communities to fame their game.”</p>
<p>Anyway, Rocket League remains a great game that’s almost as much fun to watch as it is to play, so I’m genuinely more interested in its esports tournaments than many games. If you reckon you’re good enough to represent your country in the upcoming World Cup, you can go sign up for qualification <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/register/player">over on the FIFAe site</a>.</p>

Rewild 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> has just received a free Vita Nova update, which introduces five new levels, nine buildings, a spinnable 3D world map, a new creature, the jaguar, and a more sophisticated wildlife system (that’ll be the “new life” in question, then). It endows the game’s hitherto rather decorative fauna with “deeper needs” and greater agency. Find a trailer peering through the reeds below this sentence like a jaguar slavering over an unsuspecting herd of boar. Yes, you’re the wild boar in this analogy. Run piggy, run!

If you missed Terra Nil, it’s about clearing desolate regions of detritus and pollutants and bringing back the vegetation by plonking down fancy rewilding gadgets, each of which requires biopower produced by the map tiles you restore. The new maps include Polluted Bay, in which you have to work around an utterly foul river, and Scorched Caldera, a volcano you must turn into a lake. “These, and all the new maps in the Vita Nova update, will put your reclamation skills to the test in interesting and unusual ways,” notes the press release. 
</p>
<p>
The accompanying wildlife system “adds a new dimension of strategy to the game”, with animals emerging “more naturally” in response to your restoration of the terrain. You can also nudge them about by constructing land bridges and even indirectly cultivate prey populations for predators. I’m not sure how “deep” it is in practice. It sounds like it’ll be enjoyable finding out.
</p>
<p>
But will it be enjoyable enough to offset the drawbacks identified by Hayden Hefford (RPS in peace) in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/terra-nil-review">Terra Nil review</a> last year? “It certainly feels refreshing in the citybuilding genre, which is so often focused on creating infinite growth and bustling metropolises, nature be damned, but ultimately, it's still a game about chasing numbers, and filling meters that allow you to progress,” Hayden wrote. “That alone could be comforting, some much needed calm in a busy world as you create a lush landscape, but I found its repetitive nature was more frustrating than relaxing.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve only ever played a pre-release version of Terra Nil, but I’ve interviewed developers Free Lives and they seem like a kind bunch. One thing we talked about in that interview was whether the developers might introduce human beings to the setting, living alongside the nonhuman creatures and involving themselves in the restoration process, rather than having everything hinge on the usage of shiny SimGadgets. Terra Nil is a charming game and a pleasant reprieve from climate crisis angst, but I've always found the absence of humans from its setting a bit hopeless. There's an unintended, but unfortunate parallel with <a href="https://anthrocology.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/unearthing-the-colonial-roots-of-rewilding/">how real-life rewilding projects may exclude indigenous people from their ancestral lands</a>.

<p id="NdnB90"><strong>Location:</strong> The Deflecting Hardtear can be acquired from a Furnace Golem in <strong>Gravesite Plain</strong>, likely the first Furnace Golem that you’ll encounter when you step into the DLC.</p>
<p id="K8YUlY"><strong>Effect:</strong> With Deflecting Hardtear in your Wondrous Physick, “damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.” In other words, if you perfectly time your blocks (à la <em>Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice</em>’s deflection mechanic), you’ll be able to react better in battle.</p>

It seemed to suggest that something so allegedly bad that had happened the nobody with direct knowledge could even talk about it. Four years later, Breslau stood by his original tweet in the wake of Conners’ new allegations. “I didn’t lie,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Slasher/status/1804321712219013293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Slasher/status/1804321712219013293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a post on Patreon</a></span>, Mikhail Klimentov, the former <em>Washington Post Launcher </em>editor who brokered its 2020 interview with Beahm following the ban, outlined why all the reporting on the controversy has produced so few firm answers and whether that will ever change. In it, Breslau told Klimentov that his extended break from the internet in 2022 was due in part to the Dr Disrespect ban and his tweet about it. “i cannot continue my professional career until i release a story about doc,” Breslau told Klimentov in a private message at the time. </p><p>It’s not the first time the allegations have been made publicly, either.

It was part of broader discussion on Twitch’s opaque guidelines. </p><p>Fans of Beahm, meanwhile, dug up three of Conners’ old tweets showing him using alleged knowledge of the ban to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to fill seats for his bands’ tour dates</a></span>. Many have also raised questions about why, if Conners had this alleged information for years, he didn’t disclose it previously. The former Twitch employee addressed both things in a follow-up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter-thread on June 23</a></span>. </p><p>“Those three tweets warrant admonishment,” he wrote. “Maybe more than three—the stans trying to dig stuff up have been so underwhelming that I presume they missed something. I apologize for it all because it’s worth apologize for.  The subtext of the bit, again shame worthy, is that you’re the last person to not know.”</p><p> Conners continued:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The information had been so normalized, declawed in the circles that I ran in that could be reduced to allusion and entendre. For everyone who has since said “that’s fucked”—I agreed with you on Friday night before you wrote it. I should have agreed with you sooner.  I cannot take it back but I can stop it.   I never said I’m a perfect person. I just hope this class grades on a curve.<br></p><p> That said, I’m the least sued I’ve ever been. Guys, lawyers work weekends. I don’t think they had a few things they just needed to get to before they circled back to this.  I’m also a little irked at Jake who is very clearly trying to split the difference with what he thinks is half of his potential audience but also I deserve to feel bad about the things he’s flagged. I just do. </p><p>But I also know Jake is racing to verify that screenshot from the world’s leader in multiplayer entertainment’s is legit—Enforcement ID: 7278926—and things are dragging on. Knowing who I was racing I would probably put out some content too.<br></p></blockquote><p>The last part of his message alluded to what may be the alleged screenshots of Twitch’s investigation that led to Beahm getting banned in the first place. Whether they are real or will ever become public is the question that’s been facing this entire saga from the start. Beahm returned to YouTube on Monday for his first livestream of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s massively popular <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC.<br></p><p>“For those that are looking for me to expand on this weekend, not gonna,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the opening of the playthrough</a></span>. “I already said what I needed to say. I don’t give a fuck about this guy. That’s it.” From there Beahm thanked his fans for their donations and messages of support, before pivoting into playing his Wordle match for the day. “We got you all day, baby,” viewers wrote in the chat. </p><p>Twitch, Beahm, and Conners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breslau declined to comment. <br></p><p><em>Correction 1:46 p.m. ET 6/24/2024: Klimentov posted on Patreon, not Substack. </em></p><p><em>Update 2:10 p.m. ET 6/24/2024: Added responses from Bowling, a mention of the podcast clip from Dan Saltman making similar allegations moths ago, and a note that Breslau broke the news of the ban being permanent. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>From Software game difficulty chat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">is in full swing</a> following the release of Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC, but cannier Soulslikers such as myself and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/what-are-hidetaka-miyazakis-favorite-fromsoftware-games-now-that-elden-ring-is-finished-dark-souls-and-bloodborne-left-a-very-big-impression-the-president-says/">GR</a>’s Hirun Cryer are already leaping and bounding ahead to the next Stage of Review Discourse: which From Software game is bestest? Here to settle the matter once and for all until the next time we post about it is company president Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-getting-patch-with-new-hairstyles-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/">CNET</a> to say which of the From Software games he’s worked on is his “favourite child”, Miyazaki correctly answered “first Dark Souls and Bloodborne”. Truly, the perfect reply. Interviewer David Lumb has presumably now retired from journalism, for there are no more worlds to conquer. The only way it would be better is if Miyazaki had added "which is coming to PC soon". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/souls-devs-fromsoftware-also-want-bloodborne-on-pc-even-if-the-games-own-director-cant-admit-it">He's definitely up for a Bloodborne PC port</a>, musing earlier this month that “any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past.” The onus is on Bloodborne's publisher Sony, it seems, to give the project the greenlight.</p>
<p>Ever the diplomat, Miyazaki qualified his initial response with "of course, I love them all". But grotty old Lordran and Yharnam are the gameworlds he appears to look back on mostly fondly, inasmuch as anybody looks fondly at a Souls game, even if they haven't reached quite as many people as From's later works. "On a very personal level, I would say, first Dark Souls and Bloodborne left a very big impression on me,” Miyazaki told CNET. "As a company, Elden Ring put us in a completely different league, so that was a huge milestone for the company."</p>
<p>As for From Software games Miyazaki hasn't worked on, he singled out 1995 action-RPG King's Field 2 for praise (a little surprisingly, he didn’t mention Armored Core). I like King’s Field games myself. There’s a rich vein of latter-day retro indie dungeon crawlers inspired by the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">Lunacid is a recent doozie</a>.</p>
<p>We haven’t ever published a list of the best From Software games, possibly because doing so would be akin to making a shark-diving cage out of mackerel, but we have done a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">the best Soulslikes</a>. It was last refreshed in 2021, and could probably do with an update.</p>
<p>
I have been trying to think of an elegant way to mention that Miyazaki has an actual child <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">and that being a father might influence his future games</a>, but I am now tired and irritable. Please just pretend I have cleverly inserted this bit into one of the paragraphs above.

Fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373511/dandadan-volume-1-viz-yukinobu-tatsu-shonen-jump">sci-fi horror manga</a> about a pair of hapless teenagers thrown into a bunch of supernatural nonsense won’t have to wait until October to see the anime however, as film distributor GKIDS announced on Monday that the beginning of <em>Dandadan</em> will premiere in theaters this September.</p>
<p id="eDgsOr">GKIDS, which acquired the theatrical and home entertainment rights for the anime back in June, announced that the first three episodes of <em>Dandadan</em> will screen in theaters nationwide on Sept. 13.

The current 5th Edition of D&amp;D forces players to use a potion as a full Action, meaning players miss a turn of doing potentially more interesting things if they need to heal.</p><p>Using potions as a Bonus Action has long been a popular mechanic in players' homebrew or home rules though, and even Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">the hit D&amp;D video game which follows most of 5th Edition's rules</a>, let players drink them as a Bonus Action.</p><p>The release of the updated rules, meaning the transition from 5th Edition to One D&amp;D, comes alongside the tabletop role-playing game's 50th anniversary. Publisher Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizkids-is-celebrating-dds-50th-anniversary-with-its-biggest-miniature-booster-set-ever">the biggest miniature booster set ever to celebrate</a>, and has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-look-at-the-dungeons-dragons-2024-monster-manual-cover">slowly but surely sharing tidbits of information</a> about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-2024-core-rulebooks-are-up-for-preorder">the new set of core rulebooks</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-on-xbox-series-s-can-run-at-60fps-thanks-to-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">recently added a 60 frames per second option to Starfield on Xbox Series X</a> but left the Xbox Series S version out in the cold. Thankfully modders have stepped in to save the day, as they so often do.</p><p>As verified by the tech wizards at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Starfield on the less-powerful Xbox Series S can now be played at 30fps thanks to mods (search for ‘Series S' under the mod menu). Using mods, Digital Foundry found Starfield on Xbox Series S hit a baseline of 60fps even on challenging GPU-limited areas of the game,  such as heavily populated cities, with some less-demanding areas rising to 90fps.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that playing Starfield on Xbox Series S in this way drops the resolution to 1280x720 from 1600x900. "We seem to be finding the limits of FSR 2 upscaling quality, with some ugly artefacting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-starfield-mods-unlock-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-s-so-how-well-does-it-run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry reports</a>. "Even so, you are getting a viable performance mode — it's just that the trades are far more obvious to the eye than the Series X version."</p><p>The inevitable next question is that if modders can get Starfield running at 60fps, why hasn’t Bethesda? Digital Foundry said the reduced resolution that comes with such improved frame-rate performance means “Starfield simply isn't a particularly attractive game at this point.” Bethesda, Digital Foundry suggests, may not feel this trade-off presents Starfield in as good a light as it requires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield May Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Starfield’s performance on Xbox Series S may not be front of mind for Bethesda in any case. Last week, Bethesda Game Studios chief Todd Howard responded to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-starfield-steam-reviews-plunge-to-mostly-negative-todd-howard-responds-to-paid-mods-backlash">backlash over Starfield paid mods</a>, confirming the developer would take a look at its pricing model for Creations content.</p><p>On Steam, Starfield’s recent user review rating fell to ‘Mostly Negative’ after disgruntled players hit out at Bethesda for charging $7 for a single Starfield mission. The second mission of the recently released Trackers Alliance is only available as a Starfield Creation and costs $7, or 700 credits.</p><p>Looking further ahead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Howard has confirmed plans to release a second story expansion for Starfield</u></a> following this year’s Shattered Space, and commented on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>the long development of The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-reveals-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-details-including-new-questline-requirement.909846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-details-including-new-questline-requirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard has announced plans to run a second Public Test Realm for action role-playing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, this time for Season 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-public-test-realm-lets-players-try-season-4-early">Diablo 4’s first PTR</a> ran in April and let Battle.net PC players play the well-received Season 4 early. Similarly, the Season 5 PTR gives fans a taste of what’s to come June 25 to July 2 for players with a PC Battle.net account only.</p><p>“The purpose of the PTR is to test updates and features before the launch of Season 5,” Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “Then we’ll make adjustments to Season 5 using your feedback before it goes live for everyone. The feedback we receive helps us to fine-tune balance changes, eliminate bugs, and create the best experience possible. Having a PTR gives us a chance to test new systems, and we’re grateful for your time spent playing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for what to expect from the PTR, there’s a new questline that takes place after the events of the main questline and presumably leads into the events of Diablo 4’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, which launches October 8, 2024. “Season 5 features a new story where enemies are cut-down, alliances shift, and unlikely friends emerge from the shadows,” Blizzard teased.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you’ll need to head to Hawezar in World Tier 3 and “investigate a disturbance amongst the cityfolk there” in order to trigger the questline. The World Tier 3 requirement means you’ll need to have completed the campaign and crossed over from World Tier 2 by defeating that difficulty’s Cathedral of Light capstone.</p><p>Completing this new questline lets you battle the Infernal Hordes, the new gameplay activity coming with Season 5. Infernal Hordes features seemingly endless waves of enemies, which grow more powerful with each passing day. It sounds very much like a Diablo 4 take on a wave-based rogue-lite: the Infernal Hordes is an activity where you slay hordes while earning Burning Aether to unlock powerful weapons and rewards.</p><p>Elsewhere, Season 5 introduces new Legendaries, Uniques, and items. There are quality-of-life updates to endgame bosses, too. Diablo 4 Season 5, which does not have a name yet, launches August 6.</p><h2>Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR Patch Notes:</h2><p><strong>1.5.0 PTR Build #55051 (PC)</strong> - June 25, 2024</p><h2>GAME UPDATES</h2><h3>New Items and Tempering Recipes</h3>All Classes<p><strong>Tempering Recipes</strong></p><p>Worldly Finesse - Offensive</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>+X% Critical Strike Damage</li><li>+X% Vulnerable Damage</li><li>+X% Overpower Damage</li><li>+X% Ultimate Damage</li></ul>Barbarian<p><strong>Unique Items</strong></p><p>Unbroken Chain - Amulet</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Casting Steel Grasp reduces Iron Maelstrom’s Cooldown by 5-10 seconds.
