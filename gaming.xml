While the studio continues to iron out the kinks, it has decided to delay the Switch 2 launch of Borderlands 4 to an unspecified date.</p><p>Since its launch on other platforms, players have reported technical issues with Borderlands 4, including unstable framerates, stuttering, and crashes, even on higher-end PCs. As a result of the latter, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam reviews</a> currently stand at "Mixed."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was scheduled to launch on Switch 2 on October 3, but Gearbox has pushed the date to ensure this version doesn't suffer a similar fate. As a result, Gearbox is canceling all digital pre-orders on the Nintendo eShop (though players can do this themselves or wait for it to occur automatically on Friday, September 26). The studio also states it plans to time the eventual release of this version to coincide with the arrival of cross-saves, a feature currently in development.</p><p>Here is Gearbox’s full message, as shared on <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">X</a>:</p><p>Greetings, Vault Hunters.<br>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross-saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.<br>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, September 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact [Nintendo]. For physical pre-orders, please reach out to the corresponding retailer.<br>We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.</p><p>For more on Borderlands 4, you can watch our recent interview with the developers on this episode of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video-podcast/2025/09/12/silksong-act-1-hell-is-us-review-borderlands-4-interview"><em>The Game Informer Show</em></a> podcast. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/borderlands-4/cathartic-chaos">You can read Game Informer's Borderlands 4 review by following the link</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/24/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-delayed-amid-ongoing-performance-issues]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is probably, all things considered, my favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>. As someone who isn't really a huge video game lore person at the best of times, as in I forget most of it because my brain needs the storage space for memories of food, in my eyes it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best in the mainline series.</p>
<p>This is a game that gives me the tight, strategic combat fix that I want, you see, whilst delivering a world, characters and story that fit into the overall Final Fantasy vibe incredibly well, without requiring a degree in finalising all known fantasies to understand or fully enjoy. The narrative, which sees you slip into the shoes of Ramza Beoulve as he drops nobility for rebellion, is an epic one, make no mistake. It's got all the twists and turns you'd expect, and a few more besides, making it easier to get into the groove of.</p>

<p>In serving up its fantastic story in such a direct and effective way — you can relax, I'm not gonna spoil anything — and in delivering the combat goods (and then some) upon its lovely little miniature, rotating battlefields, this game is just a winner in every conceivable way. I thought it was perfect in 1998, and I loved returning for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions#reviews">The War of the Lions</a> PSP version in 2007, an upgrade that added new characters, plot points, and jobs to proceedings. It's just one of those incredibly moreish, flexible and deep turn-based efforts, the sort of thing you can replay many times over just to test new...well, tactics.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm bringing up The War of the Lions awkwardly here, because the stuff that it added, all the good stuff that I've just listed, is cut from this new version. Well, I say "cut"...I mean, yes, it has been cut, but it has also had some of its <em>essence</em> (purely in terms of its story, I should make clear) massaged gently into aspects of the retouched narrative of The Ivalice Chronicles. So you <em>are</em> losing all the stuff you were worried you would, but you are also getting a version of the game that looks and feels as though it's been tightened up and smartened across the board in ways that make it very hard to criticise otherwise.</p>
<p>So let's start with what we do get, rather than what's missing. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> gives you <em>two</em> versions of Final Fantasy Tactics to play with; The Ivalice Chronicles, or 'enhanced' version, affords you all of the new features that I'll dig into in a moment, whereas the 'classic' version presents the original game with only minor QoL changes. Simple enough. However, there's more to it than that. There always is.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159087/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The classic version here actually uses the War of the Lion's script, you see, whilst the enhanced edition settles on a hybrid affair. You still aren't getting any of the new characters/jobs from War of the Lions back, but playing through the enhanced version, I've been impressed by how much work has been put into what's been done. This is not some lazy, slapdash, cut-content affair. We all know the game has been painstakingly rebuilt due to issues with the source code and whatnot, but with the addition of full voice-acting — easily the biggest and best addition here by the way — there's also been lots of clever tinkering with the dialogue. It now flows better, it's been cleaned up and made more easy to parse, and to <em>perform</em>, I'm sure, for the talent involved.</p>
<p>And they've gone all-out in this regard; they've even got that Ben Starr lad in. It really can't be overstated what a difference it makes to hear the words not just acted out, but acted out so damn well. Even for someone like me who gives over much of their brain storage to thoughts of meat, I'm going to remember everything that happened this time. It's emotional! And it drives home just how great a job they did first time around in giving us a rich and absorbing spin-off.</p>
<p>In terms of The Ivalice Chronicles' other noteworthy changes, you get delicately enhanced looks, now wonderfully crisp and clear, and it's a delight to see little touches such as the sunlight pouring through a window, or dust and other little bits of volumetric fun floating around in the air whilst conversations and battles take place. It's nothing that's going to make your jaw hit the floor — there's no work for Ray Tracing or any of his pals here — but it delivers exactly what it intends to in a way that doesn't mess with the classic vibes. And it performs beautifully in both docked and handheld while it does so.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159088/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With regards to gameplay, the biggest changes have happened pre-battle. Here you are now free to select characters and drop them into position on the map, a map that you can also now cursor around freely, hovering over enemies for details and so on before the action kicks off. It's therefore much easier to get the lay of the land. You can also change jobs, swap equipment, and learn new abilities in the pre-battle period, which makes a huge difference in how things flow into the meat of the game.</p>
<p>In battle, the meaningful changes continue, with a new tactical top-down view letting you get a read on things at any time without scenery getting in your way (possibly the only thing that ever annoyed me playing the first one). Turn order being highlighted down the left side of the screen is also a huge change-up for the better, as is the ability to reset your turn should you move to the wrong place.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, the UI also now shows you predicted hit damage, so you're looking at scraps that give you more info more readily and allow for much more experimentation before running moves as a result. The enemy AI has seen improvements, too; there's more range to how they react when you're trying to flank and mess with them.</p>

<p>Little touches such as improved aiming, easier manipulation of the battle arena to view angles, markers to affix to enemies so you can keep track of them, and so on, add up to a game that feels genuinely fresher. It's a notable improvement on something that was already fantastic, and that's saying something.</p>
<p>The frequency of random battles as you travel has been lessened, and you can also freely skip out of these, choosing to flee rather than engage, which is great for players who just want to get on with the main thrust of things, rather than knowing that a play session will force extra encounters on you that hold meaningful progress back.</p>
<div><p>We also get all of the auto-play, fast-forwarding through enemy turns, and skipping dialogue and cutscene options you'd expect in this day and age, so the momentum of the game can be controlled to a greater extent here - which marries very nicely with Switch 1 and 2 bringing all of this to you in portable form. It's just an easier game to play in bursts, especially given you can save at your leisure now. If you're wondering about touchscreen implementation, there isn't any, unfortunately.</p><p>

Oh, I should mention — and again without spoiling anything important, I hope — that one character, who was sort of ruined in how late they showed up to the party in the original, now gets introduced more quickly, alongside their weapon, which was a total pain in the arse to get a hold of the first time out. Good news. And if you know what I'm talking about, even better news!</p></div>

<p>Where there was only one difficulty setting to choose from in Final Fantasy Tactics of old, The Ivalice Chronicles gives us three: Squire, Knight, and Tactician. I've played through the game on Knight, which is a smoothed version of the original difficulty, and it feels slightly less frustrating, a little easier than I remember it being, so if you've played before, you might want to jump to Tactician straight away. Although make no mistake, this game is still hard, even for returning folk. And so it's nice that the easier mode is there to take away some of the gruelling aspects of battles for FF fans who want story over everything else.</p>
<p>Finally, this new version also brings back a bunch of "sound novels" which didn't originally make it to the Western release, giving lots more lore and worldbuilding to dig into. This is great, of course; however, it's the addition of the State of the Realm feature from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> that's been impressing me most. It's like they were thinking of me all along. I can jump in here and check out the story, the characters, the timeline, and the terminology at any time. I can get a re-up on my knowledge, thus enabling even the most forgetful amongst us to enter battles with a full awareness of why exactly I'm there. Truly priceless.</p>

<p>And so, what we've got here, in the end, is an excellent port of a truly fantastic tactical RPG — seriously my favourite of all the Final Fantasies I've played — that makes enjoying the thrilling tactical, turn-based combat at its core easier than ever. It tweaks things to make them smarter, it gives you more options to stop and take stock, and I personally love how it's hybridised things (to an extent) with the story.</p>
<p>Returning to the game some eight years since the last time I played it, too, I've been thoroughly impressed all over again by the flexibility, and replayability, that's built-in through the wonderful jobs system. Even without the stuff that got added for War of the Lions, when combined with the on-field strategy, the list of jobs here; from Thief to Samurai, Lancer, Dancer and/or Geomancer, the freedom it gives you to switch out and try new moves, spells and approaches to tough scraps, is as dreamily engrossing in 2025 as it's ever been.</p>
<p>For newcomers, I've got zero reservations in recommending what's here. It sits happily alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">Triangle Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valkyria_chronicles_4">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM</a> — all the tactical titans of this genre — as a must-play, and it's an adventure that's lost none of its impact over the years. Facts.</p>

<p>And yet, I can't ignore that, for returning players especially, the excision of the War of the Lions content (especially the characters and new jobs) will be a negative. Still, what a game though, eh.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles cuts content from the War of the Lions version, and it's a shame. However, put this one issue aside, if you can, and you've got a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp otherwise. Meaningful QoL changes meld with delicate gameplay nips and tucks, CPU enemy tune-ups, and a smoother-flowing experience overall to deliver a game that's pretty much impossible to knock.</p>
<p>Fans will be fully absorbed into the story all over again, enjoying the new flow of the narrative and experiencing the whole thing so wonderfully well-acted. Newcomers, who're less likely to be bothered by the missing content, well, they can just get busy lapping up one of the all-time great tactical RPGs looking and playing better than ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 2K and developer Gearbox have announced that the Switch 2 version of recently-released looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being delayed indefinitely, and that pre-orders on the platform will be canceled.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, the game is being delayed on Switch 2 in order to "deliver the best possible experience to [the two studios'] fans", and also to "better align [the Switch 2 release] with the addition of cross-saves".</p>

<p>2K and Gearbox didn't announce a new release date or window, but they did promise to reveal more once they've "fully adjusted" their plans for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=m_NGB1Wm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=9Okcs85w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being indefinitely delayed on Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Pre-orders are being canceled "in accordance with Nintendo's policy", according to 2K and Gearbox. You can initiate the cancellation process yourself if you want, but it'll automatically begin on September 26th (that's this Friday). Naturally, if you have a physical pre-order in place, you should contact the retailer.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s delay on Switch 2 comes after widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC (and consoles, but criticism seems primarily aimed at the PC version), prompting Gearbox's Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">passionately leap to the game's defense</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's assertions that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s PC performance is fine, 2K and Gearbox have pledged to continue improving&nbsp;the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">calling PC performance their "top priority"</a>.</p>

<p>All of the talk around&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance also doesn't seem to have hurt the game sales-wise, at least not in the initial surge; reports estimate that the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue" rel="nofollow">managed to shift around 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority of those sales being on PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-is-bringing-fashion-back-to-the-franchise.1306689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In the past few <em>Pokémon </em>games for the Nintendo Switch, the character customization options have been so limited that they sometimes felt like an afterthought. Though there were plenty of hair styles and clothes to choose from in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Legends: Arceus</em></a> put more emphasis on standardized outfits that made your trainer look more like an NPC than the hero of their own story. Things got even more drab in <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em> where basically every character wore one of two school uniforms, which made it seem like Game Freak did not think that players would be all that concerned about in-game fashion.</p><p>It was hard to know what to expect from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, the franchise’s first title to debut on both the original Switch and the Switch 2. But after spending some time playing around in the new game’s character customization menus, I came away feeling like <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is going to be one for the folks who have always wanted to see versions of themselves in the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p><p>Unlike previous <em>Pokémon </em>games that have let you explore massive chunks of the fictional world, the entirety of <em>Legends: Z-A </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">takes place in Lumiose</a> — a massive city located in the center of the Kalos region. While the geographical similarities between Kalos and real world France were readily apparent in <em>Pokémon X </em>/ <em>Y</em> (where the region made its debut), <em>Z-A </em>takes things to the next level by putting even more emphasis on the parallels between Lumiose and Paris. The city’s full of massive buildings, cafes, and parks where you can find wild pokémon to battle and catch. What immediately jumps out about <em>Z-A</em>’s take on Lumiose, though, is how <em>well-dressed</em> all of its residents are.</p><p>In <em>Z-A</em>, your character is a tourist who shows up in a flashy default ensemble of their own, but soon after you arrive, the game gives you a multitude of ways to give them a distinct look of their own. Almost every piece of your characters’ outfit is customizable whether it’s your shoes, socks, bottoms, tops, jackets, and various accessories like earrings. There are plenty of shorts and pants, dresses and skirts, and each garment comes in a variety of colors or patterns. And one of the bigger differences in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> compared to older <em>Pokémon </em>games is that you can equip any piece of clothing regardless of the gender option you pick when the story first begins.</p><p>The sheer variety of clothing options that <em>Legends: Z-A</em> gives you to choose from makes this version of Lumiose, like Paris, feel like a city where fashion is appreciated as a form of artistic and personal expression. The game doesn’t <em>immediately </em>let you access to a gigantic wardrobe, but that gives you another reason to participate in the city’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">Z-A Royale competition</a>. Beating other trainers in battle is one of the core ways to earn in-game currency.</p><p>Of course, you can spend your winnings on items to cure your pokémon’s ailments or pay for a snack at one of Lumiose multiple cafes — an option that heals all of your pokémon’s wounds and gives you a chance to have a little photoshoot with your favorite monster buddy. But if you want your trainers’ photoshoot looks to be coordinated with your pokémon’s aesthetic, you’ll have to spend your money to buy specific clothes at Lumiose’s various boutiques.</p><p>You can change your outfit and certain details on your face like the shape of your eyelashes pretty much anywhere. But I was not able to see for myself how robust <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s options for physical character customizations are because the demo I played didn’t give me access to certain parts of the game. Trailers have made clear that there will be quite a few hairstyles and hair colors (with an option to give your trainer highlights), which you can select at one of Lumiose’s salons. Multiple skin tones will also be available, but like your character’s gender presentation, those customizations are selected when you’re first starting the game.</p><p>One of the coolest things about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/775547/pokemon-legends-za-mega-malamar">Nintendo’s most recent round of ads for <em>Legends: Z-A</em></a> is how they turned the game’s NPCs into real people. It wasn’t just that the characters were portrayed by living actors — they were also clearly dressed like their in-game counterparts. <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s character customization options feel like they were designed to let you create trainers with their own unique senses of style. And that could be one of the things that makes the game feel fresh when it releases next month.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A Pocketpair developer has issued a response after some Pokémon fans questioned the timing of the company's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld-palfarm">Palworld: Palfarm</a> announcement, which came just a week after Nintendo revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-announce-farming-sim-spin-off-palworld-palfarm">Pocketpair announced cozy farming sim spinoff Palworld: Palfarm</a> for PC just a week after Nintendo announced fellow cozy farming sim spinoff Pokémon Pokopia for Switch 2 during its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Pocketpair, in Palworld: Palfarm you work alongside Pals to turn fields into full-functioning farms solo or in online multiplayer. “Delegate duties to plant seeds, tend to growing plants, and round up the harvest,” Pocketpair said. “Befriend the locals and unearth unexpected story arcs. Beware, the coziness can turn chaotic — watch out for wild Pals that pilfer fresh produce.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Pokopia, meanwhile, due out on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, is described as a life simulation game “where players can create their own Pokémon paradise.” The game features Ditto as its protagonist, who has transformed to look like a human. “As Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pokémon they befriend — such as Bulbasaur’s Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle’s Water Gun to revive dried-up plants — expanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pokémon,” Nintendo explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pokémon — one that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pokémon to visit. Pokémon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some were quick to question the timing of Palworld: Palfarm's announcement, despite the fact games take years to make and reveals are planned long in advance. "The timing of this just after the Pokémon Pokopia announcement. They got balls, I respect that," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1no4cdy/comment/nfp5yek/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Sweaty_Molasses_3899</a>. "They probably felt they needed to announce this earlier than they might have wanted simply to get ahead of accusations of 'copying' their idea for a farm-sim game after Pokopia got announced," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1no4cdy/comment/nfqrc9d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested KJShen</a>. "I feel like this announcement is to spite Nintendo for their recent bs," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1noik0j/comment/nfrw07k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Brohtworst</a>. "Can't be a coincidence they'd develop something so similar to Pokopia." "It's so uninspired to make a game that's more about one upping a company than actually making something good," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1noik0j/comment/nfs0chq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared stcrIight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John “Bucky” Buckley, who has become the face of the company for western fans, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1970691367224648131" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has issued a response on social media</a>, saying “the tinfoil hats are out in force.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A certain % of silliness and grumpy people were expected when announcing Palfarm, and a smaller % of "REEEE POCKETPAIR" was expected too…” Bucky said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I'm surprised how many people think we're wizard-level developers able to make a game in one week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The tinfoil hats are out in force😇”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “There is a certain level of poetic irony… the same people who "REEE POCKETPAIR" are the same people thinking we made an entire game in one week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Schrödinger's Pocketpair I guess. We are both a ‘slop company’ and capable of making entire games in one week it seems🤷‍♂️”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is of course a reference to the copying accusations Palworld itself suffered following its explosive launch early in 2024. Fans dubbed the game ‘Pokémon with guns’ due to similarities between some of the mechanics. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company eventually sued Pocketpair in a patent case that is still ongoing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-patent-lawsuit-rumbles-on-pocketpair-says-its-heads-down-getting-palworld-ready-to-exit-early-access-and-officially-release-ver-10-in-2026">Pocketpair said it was heads down getting <u>Palworld</u> ready to leave early access and officially release its 1.0 update at some point in 2026</a>. Palworld will launch proper next year alongside what sounds like a huge update, which Pocketpair is now focusing on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say"><u>some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</u></a> — as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo's lawyers trying to figure out if this breaches a future patent they're working on <a href="https://t.co/gRHF6UZj9x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gRHF6UZj9x</a></p>— Adam Vjestica (@ItsMrProducts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsMrProducts/status/1970418841391112698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>reworded one of the patents in the case</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GDC in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky</u></a> following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 2042 - Road to Battlefield 6 | Iwo Jima Update Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlefield 2042 stumbled at launch with an array of technical issues, and players also did not generally embrace some of the changes, including 124-player matches and the introduction of Specialist characters. EA steadily supported, updated, and improved Battlefield 2042, and it's now in a "completely different state than when we released it," Coutaz said. "We still have a lot of players playing."</p><p>EA is pushing people back to Battlefield 2042 right now via the <a href="https://google.com/search?q=road+to+battlefield+6+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=road+to+battlefield+6+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDM4OTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Battlefield 6 in-game event</a> that allows Battlefield 2042 players to unlock new content for Battlefield 6.</p><h2><strong>"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't"</strong></h2><p>Design director Shashank Uchil, who worked on Battlefield 2042, said the developer believed some of its big new ideas would pan out--and they simply did not.</p><p>"Look, we try stuff. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's as simple as that," Uchil explained. "We thought larger player numbers would work--it just didn't catch on. It's like when a band tries a new sound. Because we like it, but then players don't--and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want."</p><h2><strong>"We are not there yet"</strong></h2><p>Battlefield 6 is being received far more positively than Battlefield 2042, and it's not even out yet. Feedback from the game's beta tests has largely been positive, but Coutaz isn't ready to call Battlefield 6 a success just yet.</p><p>"In Swedish, we say, 'Don't say hello before you jump over the river.' And I can tell you, there is no champagne here yet. We are savouring the moment. We are not there yet. We cannot allow ourselves hubris. We are keeping our heads down, staying focused and grounded," she said.</p><hr><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

			<p>1997 was a good year for video games, and especially for those titled Final Fantasy. Between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics, it spawned two of the most beloved FF titles of all time, despite them being polar opposites. Both were on the PlayStation and both had a character named Cloud, but where one was an archetypical JRPG (by our standards, thanks in large part to this game), the other was an isometric tactical RPG, a genre which rubs shoulders with your XCOMs and Fire Emblems.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles isn’t the first time that this game has been remastered for newer consoles – that would be the 2007 enhanced PSP version Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions on the PSP – but this is easily the definitive edition of this absolute classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVCaeyucLTE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To save time, yes, this game is incredible. They wouldn’t have remastered it twice, and everyone from Famitsu to IGN wouldn’t have put it on their top games of all time lists if it wasn’t worthy. As the definitive edition, it adds plenty that long-time fans will love, including the option to play both the “Enhanced” version alongside the original “Classic” version.</p>
<p>The latest edition features a revised script and fully voiced dialogue. It also shows off a brand-new, much cleaner UI and improved graphics. You can now see the turn order more clearly, get a top-down view of the battlefield and even fast-forward through the enemies taking their turns — all of which really brings Tactics into the modern era.</p>

<p>The classic version, meanwhile, faithfully recreates the 1997 title with the War of the Lions translation. It’s nice to have, but realistically that’s just there for the old-timers who want to up their dosage of nostalgia.</p>
<p>The problem is, this game is like Marmite — you’re either going to love it or hate it. There is no middle ground.</p>

<p>For those unaccustomed to the game, FFT is set in the world of Ivalice during its middle ages, a good long time before FFXII came around. It chronicles a hero lost to history, Ramza Beoulve, who left his lofty life as a noble after seeing how they exploit the proletariat for their own gain — or to use his words, “I have no wish of changing the world for just a select few while others suffer”.</p>
<p>He is initially joined by a bunch of nameless squires who quickly specialise in a variety of job roles. While he is met with a cast of named characters, like the aforementioned Cloud (FFVII) and Balthier (FFXII), the majority of the cast are effectively nameless. Since permadeath is a thing here, and you can actually recruit enemies you meet in battle, everyone you come across has a randomly generated name, birthday and set of stats.</p>
<p>But those characters aren’t what you’re here for. In Ramza’s bid to end the war, his retinue must adapt from being boring squires into one of 18 other jobs. This includes the classics: Knight, White Mage, Black Mage and Archer, for example, but also includes the more exciting stuff, like Monk, Geomancer. It’s basically Metaphor ReFantazio, but much more complicated.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy Tactics does a poor job of explaining all the bajillion numbers on the stats screen. It also bakes in a whole bunch of weird mechanics that most people will miss at first brush, like how your character’s birthday affects how well they damage or heal other units with their spells. There’s also the more notable issue of teaching the right units the right jobs – in order to get to the powerful Dragoon class, for example, you need to go through three other jobs, which you only unlock after levelling up the previous one to the right level. Some characters are also better suited to magical jobs based on their stats, which the game doesn’t explain well.</p>
<p>Worse still, not all jobs were born equal. More’s the pity if you accidentally put too much time and effort into raising Ramza as a Chemist — a virtually useless job – and you’re going to really kick yourself for any time wasted once you get to the trickier boss fights. There’s one boss battle early on which sees Ramza fighting someone solo while the rest of his party is on a different part of the battlefield. The first time I played the game, my Ramza was a white mage. Trust me when I say it’s too easy to get punished for poor planning in this game.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the other main criticism of the game — this game is a slow burn. Half of your time is spent in tactical combat, while the other half is spent meticulously managing your party’s career path, like an overbearing parent. My wife has watched me review four Final Fantasies plus Metaphor over the years. Normally she loves the franchise, but this is the first one where she loaded up Netflix on her phone rather than watching me play “micromanagement simulator”.</p>

<p>My final gripe is that it could be a lot prettier. My PS5 had stutters on the opening cutscene and the isometric view leads to a lot of camera issues. Too many times I’ve had to swing the camera to see past a tree or through a wall. The top-down tactical cam is helpful, but you can’t make actions in this mode, which is a minor annoyance.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pokemon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull.1306599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It’s no secret that I’ve not been the biggest hype-monster when it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. I’m not big on the idea of an open game being restricted to just a city, and the combat, whilst intriguing, left me apprehensive for how it would be executed.</p>
<p>Well, I got the chance to go and play the game on Switch 2 in the Eiffel Tower recently, courtesy of Nintendo UK and The Pokémon Company International, so I can now say a few things with far more confidence.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the real-time combat? It absolutely <em>slaps</em>. Game Freak has taken some real care and consideration into how the moves we’re all so familiar with should be adapted in order to fit within a real-time system, and it works wonders.</p>

<p>Every move has its own cooldown, much like the systems in the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> games, and these vary depending on the strength of the move, as well as no doubt some other factors. Quick Attack, for example, is unsurprisingly fast to execute, and to recharge, making it a great way to dash in and swiftly poke an enemy without any real commitment.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the cooldowns, which is just as well, otherwise I’d be a fool for singing such praises. Toxic Spikes leaves <em>actual</em> toxic spikes on the ground, and the enemy Pokémon has to walk over them to be poisoned, so you not only have to use the attack, but lure them into the hazard’s hitbox, which adds another lovely extra layer to combat.</p>
<p>Similarly, some moves will leave a temporary area of effect in place, such as Whirlpool. These don't do major damage at first, but if you can corral the enemy into staying in place, that damage will creep up substantially. Protect-like moves have also changed and function more as a panic button than anything else; if you see an Alpha Houndoom charging up something massive, you can tactfully negate it with a single press of a button, which gives much more application to an otherwise one-note move.</p>

<p>Alpha Houndoom? Oh yes indeedy, Alpha Pokémon from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> are back, and bolder than ever. So bold, in fact, that it managed to hit my player character enough that I was whisked back to a Pokémon Centre in an area I wasn’t supposed to explore, and was told to fast travel back to the assigned locations <em>very quickly</em>.</p>
<p>I had an absolute blast taking this thing down, and had to rely on items a fair bit in order to eventually rase the sucker. I couldn’t just spam them though, oh no; if you use an item in combat, there’s a cooldown until you’re able to use another item from your bag, so you can’t just fully revive your entire party and cheese every encounter.</p>
<p>I also had a pop at a Rogue Mega Victreebel and its voluminous gullet. It was a fun fight, and definitely a nice change of pace, but I can’t help but feel it might have been a little more impactful if it hadn’t taken place entirely within a near-shapeless purple haze. I prefer to have some context for this stuff, and so to suddenly take the fight out of the usual playing field felt like a bit of a cheat.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m not mad keen on the usual playing field either. Lumiose City is big, but <em>sweet mercy</em> is it dull. The towering buildings end up providing what is, from my limited time with the game, a series of wide-ish corridors to explore, perhaps with the occasional, more-open area. It just feels very samey and lame. I'm hopeful that we get to see more interesting environs in the full game, but what I've seen thus far doesn’t fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>On that note, the game is also fairly uninspiring from a visual standpoint; it runs very smoothly at 60fps, but the price of that is seemingly buildings made of flat walls with balconies and the like being nothing more than part of the models’ textures. It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
<p>In fairness, the game doesn’t look <em>bad</em>, just dull and serviceable. This is probably due to the game also coming to Nintendo Switch, but the end result is, sadly, uninspiring. I’m hopeful that the combat will be enough to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but until we get our hands on Pokémon Legends: Z-A proper, hoping is all we’ve got.</p>

						<h5>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</h5><p><span>September 30, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite having been released almost thirty years ago, Final Fantasy Tactics is still remembered as one of the best tactical role-playing games ever released and one of the finest entries in the Square Enix series, thanks to its incredible story, deep gameplay, and the most refined iteration of the series’ Job system, which grants it excellent replayability. I played through the original and the War of the Lions PSP release dozens of times, testing countless strategies, experimenting with wild Job combinations, and finding unusual ways to play—all while continuing to enjoy Ramza's journey through a war-torn land and Delita's efforts to reshape their world, as if experiencing it for the first time.</p>



<p>Having played both the original and the War of the Lions release extensively, I welcomed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">announcement of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of rumors</a>. While nostalgia alone would have been enough to draw me, or any fan of the original back, Creative Studio III - the studio behind Final Fantasy XIV and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> - has delivered an enhanced version that meaningfully elevates the original with some excellent quality of life and presentation improvements.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The story of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is very compelling thanks to its amazing cast of characters.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In both Enhanced and Classic modes, the story remains faithful to the original PlayStation release, with only minor script differences in Enhanced mode based on the War of the Lion localization featured in Classic mode. The game stars Ramza Beoulve, the youngest scion of the House Beoulve that has served Ivalice with pride for centuries, often providing leaders for the Order of the Northern Sky, one of the most renowned knightly orders in the land. Young Ramza was expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and older brothers, but destiny had other plans. After a traumatic event during the campaign to take down the Corpse Brigade - a band of former soldiers and knights turned outlaws - Ramza cast aside his family name and became a mercenary in Goffard Gaffgarion's band. His values and convictions, so different from those of his older brothers, soon brought him into conflict with every man vying for power in Ivalice. In the process, he uncovered a terrible secret that would mark him in history as a despicable heretic.</p>



<p>Similarly, his childhood friend Delita Heiral’s life was forever altered during the campaign against the Corpse Brigade. Taken in by the Beoulve family after his parents’ deaths, he and his sister Tietra were raised among nobles who never hesitated to use them for their own ends. Vowing never to be used again, Delita became known as the hero who ended the War of the Lions that ravaged Ivalice. Yet, as history shows, heroes are rarely knights in shining armor, and Delita is no exception.</p>



<p>Narrated as a sort of essay on the Durai Papers (which outline Ramza's role in the War of the Lions by a fictional historian who wrote about it after the war), FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles does not shy away from showing the grim realities of war and politics, providing thought-provoking moments that feel as relevant as they did in 1997. Written by Yasumi Matsuno, the mind behind the Ogre Battle series, including Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, which shares much with Final Fantasy Tactics in gameplay and narrative, the story delivers from beginning to end. It masterfully intertwines Ramza’s “secret” history with Delita’s role in the War of the Lions, the plotting of every player in the war, and the overarching manipulations that influenced the conflict. The narrative is so rich that I think it wouldn’t be out of place to compare it to George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novels, though in a more compact and complete form.</p>



<p>Although the story is thoroughly enjoyable in Classic mode thanks to the War of the Lions script, Enhanced mode elevates it further with subtle script tweaks and some of the best voice acting I’ve experienced in years. Not only are Ramza and Delita masterfully voiced, but every other character is as well, no matter their importance. The performances add emotional weight to memorable sequences. Without giving spoilers, the spiteful remarks on the roles of nobles and lowborns delivered by a certain character at the end of Chapter 1 were unexpectedly striking, performed with incredible nuance. Other scenes later in the game are equally memorable. With performances like these, the War of the Lions never felt more real.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The improved English script and superb voice acting are some of the most notable improvements of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Experiencing the War of the Lions, and the secret war Ramza waged as the White and Black Lions clashed, would be reason enough to play The Ivalice Chronicles. But its gameplay makes it even more worthwhile. None of the game’s features were particularly innovative compared to contemporary titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</a> and the first few entries in the Shining Force and Fire Emblem series, but the way they combine still makes it a standout among tactical RPGs.</p>



<p>At its core, regardless of mode, The Ivalice Chronicles is a turn-based tactical role-playing game where players pit up to five units against the enemy, who generally outnumber them. Player and enemy AI take turns moving units, attacking with equipped weapons, and unleashing abilities depending on the Job command to complete a map's objective, often involving defeating all enemies, a specific enemy, or protecting a guest unit. Basic Jobs like Squire and Chemist provide simple skills, while advanced Jobs - unlocked after improving others - offer specialized abilities. Knights can use Art of War to reduce stats and destroy equipment; White and Black Mages handle healing and offensive elemental magic; Thieves excel at stealing; and hybrid Jobs like the Samurai offer balance between physical and magical attacks.</p>



<p>Using a Job "as-is", however, is not the way to go in FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. The game's Job System is one of the most versatile variants of the system still today, allowing players to create units that can equip every Job command, alongside Reactive (counterattacks based on Bravery), Support (passive boosts), and Movement abilities (mobility enhancers). This system, and some of its quirks, such as the stat growths of each Job and how certain abilities scale, allow for the creation of so many different units, and some rather unusual ones that no one would ever try to combine. For example, the infamous White Mage/ Lancer combination is still as effective as ever. With the White Priest's surprisingly good speed stat growth and the Lancer's Jump requiring high speed to be more viable, it's possible to create a healer that can strike enemies from anywhere on the map. Another example is the Black Mage/ Samurai combo, which can make the Iaido Job command devastating at high magic power.</p>



<p>Even sticking specific abilities to certain Jobs can make them way more effective. For example, a Knight with the Ninja's Dual Wield skill not only can deal massive damage with weapons equipped in both hands, but can attempt the Art of War abilities twice per turn, making it easier to break equipment and lower stats. A Chemist, an Orator, and an Archer also make for great equipment-breaking units with the Art of War command, as the Knight Job command works with ranged weapons like guns, bows, and crossbows. The great synergy between different Job abilities is further enhanced by Job synergy as well. For example, a powerful Monk works great as a support for any magic-based units, as the Chakra ability restores HP and MP depending on physical attack. Add in the special jobs of story characters like Mustadio the Machinist and Agrias the Holy Knight and recruitable monsters, and you get a customization system so deep that any combination of Job and abilities can work well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Decades after its first release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS</em> - <em>The Ivalice Chronicles' gameplay continues to be highly engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, having such a deep customization system opens up some balancing challenges. The original PlayStation release is known for being a game that is very easy to break, and the same applies to FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. Although Enhanced mode features multiple difficulty settings, including a hard difficulty mode called Tactician Mode, if you have already played the original or the War of the Lions release, you will have no trouble winning every story battle with ease. Knowing enemy positions and abilities is a massive boon in a game where you are often outnumbered, as proper preparation is the key to victory, especially in a certain infamous multi-stage battle in Chapter 3. Thankfully, the high difficulty of these battles has been toned down by a quality-of-life improvement that allows the player to return to the world map between battles. Enemy levels also do not scale with the player, unlike random battles, where enemies are at the level of your most powerful units, so in a few cases, it's possible to brute force your way through by grinding even without having a solid customization plan for your units.</p>



<p>Those who never played the game before, however, will find FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles to be rather challenging even at regular difficulty, especially at the beginning of the game with limited knowledge of the game's main mechanics. In this regard, the new version of the game does an excellent job bringing the player up to speed, providing all the information needed with some thorough explanation of the battle mechanics and the Job system. This can overwhelm newcomers and be tricky to apply at first. Thankfully, it doesn't take long for everything to click, and by the time you reach some of the game's infamous challenges, you should be well-versed in the game's intricacies to properly set up your characters. Just make sure to have multiple save files if you are playing in Classic mode, or you risk having to restart the game from the beginning, as one of these battles requires specific abilities to win. </p>



<p>This challenge will also be the last hurdle you will need to overcome, as soon after, an extremely powerful character will join your party, one who can clear maps all by himself due to his job command and overpowered equipment, further highlighting some of the game's balancing issues. This character feels slightly toned down over the original, but he is still extremely powerful and embodies a sort of hidden Very Easy mode that, thankfully, can be easily avoided by not using him in every battle.</p>



<p>Classic mode being a recreation of the original with some minor tweaks lifted from the War of the Lions release, but without any of its additional content, such as extra characters and Jobs, only Enhanced mode features the wealth of quality of life improvements outlined before release. These improvements may sound minor on paper, but they improve the experience greatly. The new menu keeps the spirit of the original, but it's way more usable, featuring a new Job Tree that provides a clear look at upgrade paths. The in-battle interface provides a clear turns timeline that makes it easier to use abilities that require charging, like magic and the Archer's Aim Job command. The ability to cancel units' movement and the option of speeding up combat are also great additions that make battles snappier and more enjoyable. </p>



<p>Rounding up the new features is the ability to see the map while deploying units, and enemy units in random battles as well, and the extremely welcome option of fleeing from random battles, which makes traveling around the map hassle-free. A State of the Realm summary has also been added, making it very easy to follow events and learn more about characters in conjunction with the Encyclopedia that provides detailed information on characters, locations, and terms.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The compact yet varied map design is one of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles' most notable features.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most noticeable change Enhanced mode introduces over Classic mode is a visual overhaul, including a few new cutscenes that look significantly better than those in Classic mode, alongside generally enhanced graphics. The visual overhaul, however, is only a modest improvement. While locations and sprites display at higher resolution and have lost the pixelated look of the original, some visual noise remains noticeable throughout, so much so that I wish there were an option to combine all of Enhanced mode's new features and superb voice acting with Classic mode's visuals. In this regard, the soundtrack fares similarly: both Enhanced and Classic modes feature the original score, which still sounds fantastic, though it would have benefited from a remastering.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Speaking about the PC version specifically, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is a competent, if not a little barebones, port. With undemanding visuals in both Enhanced and Classic Modes, my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) had no trouble running the game at locked 60 FPS at 4K resolution. In terms of options, the game doesn't feature much, only including a Display Mode selection for Borderless, Windowed, Fullscreen, a resolution selection, a brightness slider, and toggles for a focal effect and VSync. While having a forced 60 FPS cap and the lack of graphics settings can disappoint some, with its undemanding visuals, even dated system configurations should have no trouble running the game smoothly at any resolution. The option to rebind keyboard controls is also a welcome option that too often is missing in modern PC ports.</p>

<p>Despite minor visual inconsistencies and some missing content, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is an outstanding reimagining of a classic tactical RPG. With meaningful quality-of-life improvements, superb voice acting, and its rich, immersive story, it’s a must-play for both returning fans and newcomers.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-bonus-spinoff-dark-ties-revealed-during-rgg-summit.1306590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, confirming long-swirling rumors, but the game won't launch alone; it'll also come with a bonus prequel-slash-spinoff focusing on prominent character Yoshitaka Mine.</p>

<p>The game was announced during today's Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, but its existence was actually all but confirmed earlier this month, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">accidentally leaked via the official RGG website</a>. Still, now it's official!</p>

<p>As you'd imagine from the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>name, <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>will serve as a full ground-up remake of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, complete with revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and extra scenes that promise to "deliver more depth and emotion" to the game's "beloved story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=TrAi3anl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=OuqtjZc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having been leaked earlier this month,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>is now official.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you can also expect "new and enhanced side experiences", and if previous&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remakes are anything to go by, that means we'll be getting new substories, as well as expanded versions of the game's existing side content.</p>

<p>As if all of this wasn't enough (and believe me, given the average length of <i>Yakuza</i>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>experiences, it almost certainly will be), RGG has thrown in a new prequel-slash-spinoff as part of the experience as well.</p>

<p><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>tells the story of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he endeavors to find "true bonds" after leaping into the "dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything". The prequel will offer new side experiences and "exhilarating boxing-based combat", according to RGG.</p>

<p>You can check out an announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of some of the changes that have been made to the game.</p>




<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9N2370NCNW1M/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2, and they'll come as a full package, so you won't need to buy&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>separately.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Crucial X10 portable SSD is available in up to 8TB. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">A couple of them are listed as being one sale, but there sale prices are proportional to where the others not on sale are just set at by default.</a> So to avoid any confusion, let’s just break down where each is selling for now.&nbsp;The 1TB model is set at an even $100. $165 will get you 2TB. For $240, you can get the 4TB model. The 6TB model is going for $320. Then we have the 8TB model for just $440. Essentially, you’ll only paying $55 per terabyte when you go with the largest capacity SSD available.</p>
<p>Whether you are a creator, student, or PC gamer, you’re going to need a massive amount of storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>For gamers in particular, video game files sizes keep creeping up higher and higher with every new release. Some games like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>reach gigabyte counts upwards of the triple digits. Some modern PCs come with just a1TB of storage or even less. You have to constantly delete and redownload games if you want to play more than just a handful. Expanding to up to 8TB will eliminate this data storage maintenance nightmare for you.</p>
<p>Same goes for creators. If you’re working with video and photo editing, that raw footage and pictures can add up pretty fast on your internal drive. The Crucial external SSD will allow you to expand to a workable amount of storage, plus take it with you when you need it on the go. The Crucial drive is compact. It’s kind of crazy that you can fit a full 8,000GB in your pocket, but here we are. Plus, its IP65 dust and water resistant, keeping it safe from the elements. It’s been test to be able to handle drops of up to 9.8 feet.</p>



<h2>All That Data on the Go</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">The Crucial X10 portable SSD is much faster than an HDD.</a> It’s working with read and write speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s. You’ll have no issue editing big video files or loading up AAA games on your PC. And the external drive is widely compatible with other devices besides PC. In addition to Windows, you can also use it with Mac, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, Android, Linux, as well as PS4, PS5, and Xbox via USB-C and USB-A.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get the Crucial X10 portable SSD for as low as $100 for 1TB or splurge for the full 8TB option for just $440 for a limited time.</p>

              <p><span>If you asked the average person to imagine the perfect video game, it probably wouldn’t be something limited by the original PlayStation’s R3000 processor and 2MB of RAM. The majority of it probably wouldn’t take place in crude, polygonal 3D dioramas floating in empty space, brought to life by 32-bit sprites that look like archaic cloth dolls whose faces have no noses. If there were dramatic action, it definitely wouldn’t all be ploddingly turn-based, confined to grids, and governed by opaque math that’s viscerally felt rather than clearly understood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I feel confident they wouldn’t think up anything close to </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, but nearly three decades later, Square Enix’s 1997 spin-off remains a shockingly clever, intimate, and effective masterpiece. It tells an existential tale of conspiracy and betrayal using Shakespearean puppets who are as defined by their morality and ambition as they are by their ever-evolving </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> stat sheets. There are no villains or heroes in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, just people corrupted by power and those unwilling, even in the face of bitter death, to trade their humanity for it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>How do you improve on that? What would you add to </span><i><span>Pet Sounds</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Apocalypse Now</span></i><span> in the year 2025 to make them better? This is the impossible task laid at the feet of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, a ground-up remaster that tries to stay faithful to the original while softening its harder edges for modern audiences and smoothing over its classic pixel art for HD displays. It succeeds more often than not, with a raft of small tweaks I now can’t live without and a new hard mode that has been kicking my ass and making my latest playthrough feel nearly as urgent as my first.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Still the best</span><i><span> Final Fantasy </span></i><span>story&nbsp;</span></h2> <p><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> begins with the kidnapping of a princess and ends with a showdown in hell. The end of one war turns into the start of another as a succession fight in Ivalice plunges an already broken nation into civil war. At the center of it is the nobleman-turned-mercenary Ramza Beoulve, whose winning mix of naive idealism and an unshakable sense of justice make him a formidable foil for Machiavellian plots plunging the kingdom into chaos. But </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is a game about history, not fairy tales, and there are no happy endings awaiting Ramza or anyone else in Ivalice. There is only the peace they make for themselves by deciding what’s right and accepting no substitutes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When the game starts, Ramza is fresh out of the military academy and ready to crack some peasant heads for rising up against the aristocracy. Along with lowborn pal Delita, he’s tasked with putting down a local rebellion by veterans returning home from a foreign war who now demand a voice in governance the same way they had one on the battlefield. </span><span>Cast as thieves and kidnappers, the members of the budding revolutionary movement find themselves being mercilessly cut down by the spoiled youngest child of one of Ivalice’s most powerful families.</span></p>

 <p><span>Only after a series of chance encounters with the leaders of that movement does Ramza experience the slow-dawning realization that those in power are more concerned with maintaining it than with using it to benefit others. The end of his first military campaign proves a tragic awakening as he and Delita are sent spinning off along inverted and irreconcilable trajectories. The ideological wool clipped from his eyes, Ramza must try to save Ivalice from ruin with no army at his back and no clear beliefs to guide him.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><i><span>D&amp;D</span></i><span> chess at its peak</span></h2> <p><span>It’s against this grim but hopeful medieval backdrop that</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> has you tinkering with one of the best class customization systems of any RPG, deployed across one of the best combat systems of any turn-based strategy game. Your burgeoning squad of misfits can train to become everything from armor-breaking knights and potion-dispensing chemists to master mimics or warriors wielding literal math to bring their enemies to heel.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of these jobs has innate strengths and weaknesses as well as underlying stat growth bonuses that accrue as you level up. You can also mix and match different abilities from different jobs after you’ve acquired enough points during combat to unlock them. This includes not just active abilities but also passives, counters, and movement bonuses. Want a White Mage who steals weapons, walks on lava, and carries a gun? You can do that. Want a Samurai who teleports around the map, dual-wields magical staves, and can summon Bahamut? You can do that, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628145">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these combos are a mess. Others are completely OP. Exploring the contours delineating those two is one of the big pleasures of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, the rare strategy RPG that is happy for you to leverage any trick available to not just survive the battle but completely dominate it. By the time you’ve unlocked and mastered the game’s final handful of jobs, enemies can be disabled or completely wiped out from across the map before they ever reach you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While unit positioning, loadouts, and turn order play defining roles in the game’s early battles (I’m looking at you, Dorter Slums), these familiar rhythms begin to shift and are eventually upended across the game’s four chapters. Early wars of attrition give way to brawls that quickly turn in your favor as you one-shot enemies with clever buildcrafting. Where some strategy games try to recreate the grand scale of big armies colliding, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> recreates the operatic pageantry of an epic turn-based RPG fight instead, and all of the chaotic peaks and valleys that comes with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Giving an all-time classic a fresh voice</span></h2> <p><span>Original director Yasumi Matsuno has re-edited the script, based on the</span><i><span> War of the Lions</span></i><span> PSP port, and it’s fully voiced now. The result is a much clearer and more natural-sounding localization in which each character’s personality comes through in more nuanced ways. One-note villains like the Fell Knight Goffard Gaffgarion and the Grand Duke Gerrith Barrington are given slightly more room to explain themselves and convey their motivations. Fan-favorite comrades like Agrias Oaks and Cidolfus Orlandeau get the opportunity to shed more light on their backstories before being abruptly shuffled offstage.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                      <p>             Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles           </p>                                       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Still one of the best to ever do it"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Strategy RPG</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Grim but heartfelt story, intricate job system, all-time soundtrack, and tons of welcome improvements </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Some of the visual trade-offs, occasional voice acting misses, and the lack of new content</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5 (played), PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 29, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>Beat the main campaign and completed some side quests. About 25 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>I’m not a fan of all of the new writing. There are some scenes in the back half of the game that start to feel like slightly verbose retreads of points characters have already made in the past but feel compelled to rehash before locking swords. There was also an uncluttered directness to some of the lines in the original English version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>that has been sanded off in the remaster. It does include the “original” version of the game, but only with the Elizabethan-inspired script of the </span><i><span>War of the Lions</span></i><span> rewrite. As mangled and confusing as it was in spots, that original version, complete with “blame yourself or god,” deserves a place in the remaster as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628146"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628146">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are some hitches in the visual overhaul as well. While most of </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles </span></i><span>does an excellent job of recreating the original aesthetic in HD, and I eventually came around to the more modern font and UI styles, there are some scenes in which the new textures look unimpressively flat without the depth of their original pixel art. Animation-wise, the remaster is almost completely free of slowdown. If there’s one area in which the new version arguably looks worse than the original, it’s the summons. Shiva, Titan, Bahumut and others feel a bit abridged and washed out. These are the definition of nitpicks, however, and unless you’ve played hundreds of hours of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> too, you’ll probably have no idea what I’m talking about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even if there were bigger issues that felt like deal-breakers, many of them would be worth the trade-off for the other improvements </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> makes. Amid myriad minute tweaks, the most obvious is the fact that you can now reset your character’s movement before they act and you can fast-forward through any part of the game. In addition, random encounters on the world map are now optional when traveling between locations and you can set custom loadouts for characters that you swap between on the fly. Complete with a new lore recap page and map markers that make it easier to track side quests, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is more new-player-friendly than ever, without compromising any of its core virtues.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span>The new hard mode is no joke</span></h2> <p><span>Much has been made of Square Enix’s decision not to add any new jobs or meaningful additional side content to the remaster. In lieu of any of that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by just how challenging the game’s new hard mode is. While easy mode is very forgiving and even normal has been tuned in players’ favor, the highest difficulty setting has seen me get my teeth kicked in, even during throwaway battles I never used to worry about.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the battles appear the same, complete with the same exact enemy builds and layouts, opposing units hit much harder and don’t go down easily. I thought this would keep me on my toes mostly in the earlier part of the game when my party was still growing into their best jobs and acquiring their strongest skills. Instead it’s been dogging me throughout the entire game, forcing me to grind, be mindful of the team I’m fielding, and play conservatively once the battle has started.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628147"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628147">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One big factor is a change to how long certain skills take to charge during combat. Archer attacks and powerful spells can now be cast in only a handful of turns when they used to be so slow they were borderline useless. It’s great for players who want to experiment with some of the game’s more overlooked abilities, but it’s also a gift to enemies who can now wreck you twice as quickly. Gameplay remains beautifully broken in all the right places, but the hard mode pushes players to work a little harder to find those pressure points and exploit them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I thought I was ready for the worst in the game’s infamous battle at Riovanes Castle only for it to punish me in new and unexpected ways. Some of these skill checks are cheap and arbitrary, but that feels right for a game that’s all about looking at spreadsheets of stats and abilities and finding ways to cheat the system. A well-known exploit for the battle in question remains active in the game, despite being derived from a coding error decades ago. These aren’t messy wrinkles to be ironed out. They’re unique blemishes that remind you</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>was built by people for people.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> isn’t the perfect version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> I can imagine in my head, but it’s unquestionably the best version of the one that actually exists. </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, like its protagonist Ramza Beoulve, stands athwart history a flawed but uncompromising messenger with one simple plea: “Go back and play one of the best games ever made.”&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>I love Pokemon's turn-based battle mechanics. For nearly 30 years, Game Freak has tuned its rock-paper-scissors style combat to near perfection. Different generations have added new mechanics and gimmicks to keep things fresh, but Pokemon's battles have always been built around turn-based combat. With Pokemon Legends: Z-A, however, Game Freak aims to redefine what a Pokemon battle is, a fact which, naturally, gave me some pause. Yet after over an hour with the game, I'm convinced they might have pulled it off.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends: Z-A opens with your character arriving in Lumiose City by train. Unlike Arceus, there is no time travel; Z-A takes place in the present after the events of Pokemon X and Y. Outside of the train station you meet a trainer, either Taunie or Urbain depending on who you pick, who will give you a starter Pokemon: Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. Before I was able to pick the Totodile, the clear winner of the three, we were thrown into a Wild Zone a few hours later in the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Zones are scattered throughout Lumiose City and are home to wild Pokemon waiting to be caught. The zone I explored was crawling with Houndours and Bunearys. The Wild Zone covered a few blocks of Lumiose City, and was much smaller than the expansive areas we saw in Arceus. Based on a few quick glances at the map, this zone seems like one of the smaller ones, but even the larger Wild Zones appeared to be much smaller than any of the regions from Arceus. However, these Wild Zones appear to use Lumiose City's density and verticality to their advantage. I found some back alleys and rooftops that hid items and special encounters, including a level 40 Alpha Pikachu that sent me flying off a multi-story building and electrocuted its way through most of my party. Fortunately, there are cafes dotted throughout Wild Zones that can heal your Pokemon for a small fee. If you or all your Pokemon get knocked out, you're sent back to a Pokemon Center outside of the Wild Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who played Legends Arceus should feel at home with Z-A's catching mechanics as, fundamentally, not much has changed: sneak up on an unsuspecting Pokemon, line up your throw, and chuck a Poke Ball. If you're spotted, you can send out a Pokemon of your own and weaken it before tossing another Poke Ball. It's just as intuitive as it was before, albeit with fewer tools at your disposal. In Arceus you could craft Smoke Bombs to hide, throw berries to distract, and hurl balls of mud to stun Pokemon yet I didn't have access to any of these tools in my session. It's unclear if these have been removed from Z-A, or if they simply weren't available in this demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717"></a><figcaption>The main character and Urbain in front of the three starters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">During this portion of the demo, I was also encouraged to experiment with Z-A's character creator. Like Scarlet and Violet, you can bring up the character screen in the menu and tweak your character's hair and facial features on the fly. Z-A has a lot more clothing customization options than both Scarlet and Violet, too. I didn't spend too much time tweaking my character because of time constraints, but there seems to be plenty of fashion accessories to mix and match.</p><p dir="ltr">After a stint in the Wild Zone, I dipped my toes into the Z-A Royale, a city-wide tournament that tasks contestants with battling through the ranks in order to challenge tougher and tougher opponents. Each night, trainers gather around the city and you'll need to defeat them to earn a Challenger Ticket. Once you've collected enough points, you can participate in a Promotion Match to increase your rank.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Positioning plays a key role. When you issue an attack, your Pokemon automatically moves to a spot where its attack can connect and locks in place, leaving them open for a counter attack.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">During the Z-A Royale, trainers prowl the streets at night with a Pokemon by their side. If you manage to sneak up on them, you'll do some free damage before the battle starts. At the outset, combat feels much more frantic than a traditional Pokemon battle. Attacks are on a cooldown, and you can throw out as many as you'd like regardless of what your opponent is doing. This doesn't mean you can ignore the opposing Pokemon, though. Each move has a speed rating that determines how long the wind-up is, and some moves could leave your Pokemon vulnerable for an extended period of time while others could fire off right away. Moves like Quick Attack, for example, have priority over moves like Flame Wheel, which traditionally requires a bit of a wind-up.</p><p dir="ltr">Other moves, like Whirlwind, Double Team, and Toxic Spikes, have also been redesigned to fit this format. In previous entries, Whirlwind forces a player to switch Pokemon, but in Z-A, it knocks the opposing Pokemon back to free up some space. Double Team, like Protect, appeared to make your Pokemon invulnerable for a period of time. Meanwhile, Toxic Spike, a move that normally punishes switch-ins, now leaves physical traps on the battlefield that will poison an opposing Pokemon that makes contact with them. Seeing how different moves translate to Z-A's combat style was a highlight for me, and I can already think of so many opportunities to use Pokemon's vast moveset to its full potential here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718"></a><figcaption>Tepig facing off against a Simisage for a Promotion Match</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you're exploring these cordoned off Z-A Royale areas, you'll come across Battle Tickets. These offer challenges that, when completed, net you extra points. In the segment I played, these challenges ranged from landing sneak attacks to hitting weaknesses. They were all fairly simple, and most could be completed in one battle with a little extra forethought. That said, I do hope these Battle Tickets get tougher as you progress, as I can see them becoming a chore if the challenges never evolve beyond what I saw. Checking off these challenges while defeating trainers was the most efficient way to rank up in the Z-A Royale, and within 15 minutes or so, I was prepping for my Promotion Match.</p><p dir="ltr">Promotion Matches feel like Z-A's take on gym battles. These battles take place in an arena rather than the streets of Lumiose City, and you can't sneak up on your opponent for an advantage. The trainer I fought was a cook packing Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear. While I didn't have much trouble dispatching his Pokemon, his play style did seem a little more defensive than the rank-and-file I challenged beforehand. Most notably, he was quick to throw up Protects against my super effective attacks. By his third and final Pokemon, I was a little more deliberate when I'd fire off an attack to account for his Protect and its cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo ended with a frantic battle against Mega Victreebell that played out similarly to the Mega Absol fight from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">my first preview</a>. Mega Victreebell was launching attacks left and right, and I had to find openings with my Houndoom to land super effective hits. As I dealt damage, glowing orbs scattered around the arena that eventually let me activate a Mega of my own. Mega Evolved Pokemon can only stay like that for so long, though. Once the meter on the bottom left runs out, they return to their standard form. Collecting more orbs can extend its Mega Evolution, but not by much. Despite having a few Pokemon that could Mega Evolve, I opted to go with Houndoom because of the clear fire type advantage. However, even with the type advantage, Mega Victreebell did manage to knock out my Houndoom, forcing me to send out a different Pokemon while I tended to Houndoom's wounds with items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716"></a><figcaption>A Rogue Mega battle against a Victreebell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These fights are reminiscent of the Frenzied Pokemon battles from Pokemon Legends: Arceus The difference is that you don't need to quell the boss with balms before you battle it. Instead, you are calling out attacks and dodging hazards from the beginning. These battles are much more dynamic, requiring you to split your attention between positioning, attack cooldowns, and HP bars. It wasn't particularly difficult, but there is some depth here that could lead to challenging fights later in the game.</p><p>Throughout every section of my demo, Pokemon Legends: Z-A ran flawlessly on a docked Nintendo Switch 2. It's hard to gauge an exact frame rate without extensive testing, but it looked to be 60 frames per second without any noticeable hitches. Of course, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also coming to the Nintendo Switch, and we have no idea how it runs on Nintendo's last-gen hardware. Hopefully its performance is smoother than Arceus and Scarlet and Violet, but we'll have to wait until next month to see.As promising as Z-A looks, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. I've played around two hours, but I still haven't been able to explore Lumiose City at my own pace. What else does the city have to offer? Does it tie in to Pokemon X and Y in any meaningful way? Are there new regional forms like we saw in Arceus? How does multiplayer work? We'll get answers to these questions very soon when Pokemon Legends: Z-A drops on October 16, 2025.</p>

			<p>Silent Hill f locks every cutscene to 30 FPS on all formats, but on PC, this limitation can be easily lifted with Special K, delivering a smoother experience, although with some caveats.</p>



<p>Yesterday, BenchmarKing reported on <a href="https://x.com/BMKing23">their X profile</a> that the 30 FPS lock can be lifted by using the Framerate Limiter function of what is commonly known as the Swiss Army Knife of PC gaming, delivering smoother transitions between cutscenes and gameplay and an overall better experience. If you have never heard of this tool, more information and a download link can be found on the <a href="https://www.special-k.info/">Special K official website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After testing this out, I can say that removing the lock with Special K improves the experience, but with some caveats. In the opening cutscenes, for example, some sequences benefit more than others from a higher framerate. The sequence where Hinako and her sister have a brief talk, and the following family argument between Hinako and her parents, benefit the most thanks to there being more action on screen and quick camera cuts. The sequence showing Ebisugaoka under the rain, on the other hand, shows less noticeable improvements due to slower camera cuts and a lack of action, limited to the falling rain.</p>



<p>Although I didn't find the Silent Hill f 30 FPS lock for cutscenes particularly impactful, it is definitely surprising that it has been implemented, as it makes transitions from cutscenes to gameplay clunky and somewhat unpleasant. While this stopgap solution is welcome, an official removal of the lock would be preferable, as every cutscene would benefit from running at higher framerates.</p>



<p>Not counting some weird design choices like this cutscene framerate lock, Silent Hill f is a thououghly enjoyable game, thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">engaging and memorable story and gameplay that masterfully blends familiar mechanics with some new features</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S to all those who purchased the Deluxe Edition. It will launch for everyone else tomorrow, September 25.</p>

Players can expect re-recorded voice lines as well as brand new ones, and "overhauled" animations, with some scenes "changed drastically with different developments and outcomes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In order to greatly outdo ourselves and make a game that everyone will love, we didn't take the safe, defensive route by glorifying the past with a simple remake, but instead took a more aggressive approach to make Yakuza Kiwami 3," Horii said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🐉A LEGEND IS REBORN AND A NEW LEGACY BEGINS🐉<br>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases Feb 12, 2026 on PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Nintendo Switch™ 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam).<br>👉Digital pre-orders now live (link in bio)!

            <p>Embracer's new CEO Phil Rogers has discussed the company's use of AI in its latest Annual General Meeting, praising the technology but insisting "human authorship is final".</p>
<p>Previous CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">Lars Wingefors left Embracer earlier this summer</a>, with Rogers taking over in August. AI tools can be a "power multiplier" he said, though insisted this isn't "corporate speak" but "words we're hearing from studio heads and heads of production".</p>
<p>"In an industry defined by escalating development costs and limitless player expectations, the question is no longer if a company will adopt a technology like AI, but how it leads with it? How we take Embracer forward across Fellowship? Our answer is a smart implementation of generative AI in ethical and sustainable ways," he said.</p>
<p>"We really do view AI as a strategic catalyst," he continued. "It's the most powerful technology or tool of our generation for driving efficiency, amplifying creativity, and ultimately delivering the high-quality, memorable games that players demand more effectively, more predictably, and more profitably than before."</p>
<p>AI tools are being used across multiple departments by animators, designers, engineers and more, though Rogers emphasised the need for "tuning by human hand" so developers can "add their unique authorship".</p>
<p>For instance, Rogers claimed AI advancements allow for in-game animations that are "indistinguishable" from motion capture, which can see "a seven day mocap shoot cut in half".</p>
<p>"This isn't a theoretical future," said Rogers. "It's happening now and the results are quite compelling. Many of our studios have been experimenting with AI in the past couple of years and are now starting to really leverage it to eliminate bottlenecks and empower our development teams. We're beginning to see measurable increases in productivity."</p>
<p>His view is that AI can reduce busywork and repetitive tasks, though he acknowledged criticism of AI tools within the industry and the need to protect workers. As such, the company's core principle is "empower, never replace".</p>
<p>"We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike, but we believe the greatest risk is not in using AI, but in using it without a strong ethical framework," said Rogers. "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices. Developers want creative freedom to innovate and experiment and reduce iteration time so they can make more content. Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism. Intellectual properties need to be nurtured and respected."</p><p>He continued: "For us, ethics and good business are one and the same. They really do go hand in hand. Our position is clear: human authorship is final. Our developers will always have the final creative control and authorship. After all, AI is a co-pilot. It is not the pilot."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-ceo-acknowledges-ai-concerns-but-says-the-tech-can-become-a-creative-catalyst-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Game Developer</a> pointed out, Rogers' comments ironically come days after Embracer subsidiary Aspyr <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">issued a hotfix</a> for its latest Tomb Raider Remastered collection to remove "unauthorised AI generated content" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-lara-croft-taking-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-ai-generated-voice-use-in-tomb-raider-remasters">criticism from French Lara Croft actress Françoise Cadol</a>, who claimed her performance had been replicated without consent.</p>
<p>Further, Rogers' comments mirror those of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">Blizzard developers interviewed by Eurogamer</a>, who claimed AI can be used for "menial" areas but they always retain a "handcrafted" feel.</p>
<p>Indeed, AI was a common theme at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-was-everywhere-at-gamescom-2025">as Eurogamer reported</a>, with some indie teams claiming AI tools are invaluable.</p>
<p>AI tools are also being used for remasters and remakes, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gaming-ai-remasters-can-they-be-any-good">Keywords in particular experimenting with AI at every stage</a> - but can they ever be good?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Developer LilliLandia Games (which sits under Tencent Games) has revealed its first trailer for an upcoming Switch 2 life sim called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animula-nook">Animula Nook</a>. Yeah, we're not too keen on the name either, don't worry.</p>
<p>There's no release date for this one yet, but it'll be making an appearance at this week's Tokyo Game Show. The 4-minute long trailer does, however, give us quite a bit to work with, showcasing a whole bunch of CGI cutscenes along with a smattering of <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>-inspired gameplay. Visually at least, it looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p>What we're not quite to sold on right now is the actual gameplay. It looks a little slow, a little clinical, and there's a lot of information missing from the trailer. Where's the UI, for example? We can see scenes in which the main protagonist is decorating their home and garden, but how exactly is this being translated into gameplay?</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now, because there's a lot that we like about this. Hopefully its appearance at TGS will shed some more light on how the gameplay will actually function.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Discover a tiny yet immense world:</strong> Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>- Collect beyond the ordinary:</strong> In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</p>
<p>-<strong>Build with everyday objects:</strong> Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Befriend the world’s tiny folk:</strong> This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</p>
<p><strong>- Define yourself in every detail:</strong> Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</p>
<p><strong>- Convenient creative tools:</strong> Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

From there, you can click the plus sign to add users in your friends list to your group. Once you’ve finalized adding the people you want to invite, click or tap the Join button to send the invitation. After everyone arrives, you have the option to pick an experience for you all to play and send invites for them within the Party screen to join your game. Even when you’re offline, the party will still be available for the next time you play.</p><p>If you want to add a user to a party you’ve already created, go to the group you wish to edit and click the three dots on the top right of your screen. You can then select “Add Connections” and search for the player’s username, finally clicking “Add” to include them in the group.</p><p>Those who are waiting to join a party should first ensure that they’re on the host’s friends list. If so, you’ll receive a notification either through the app or via mobile push notifications. You can also open the Party tab to see any active parties. Tap on the host’s party or notification and click “Join” to get into the group.</p><p>There are a few limitations for you to keep in mind. The first is that only players over the age of 13, or a parent or caregiver, can create a party. Those using parental controls can restrict party access entirely or limit it to one-on-one access only, such as you playing a game with your child or having one friend join them at a time. If you are over 13, you can also only chat via text, but voice chat is coming soon. Finally, the maximum party size is six players, including the host.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083"></a><figcaption>As the host, you'll have control over the games you play with your friends, as well as the ability to moderate the party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_keep_your_Roblox_Party_safe_"><span>How to keep your Roblox Party safe</span></h2><p>As the host of the party, you should absolutely be able to trust the players you game with. Should anyone need a time out, you can navigate to the group they are in, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, then the three dots next to the user in question. You can then “Report” or “Remove from group,” depending on how serious it is. Remember that if the user breached the Roblox Community Standards and Terms of Use, you can report the user first, then remove them to ensure that Roblox moderators are aware of the infractions.</p><p>If anyone breaches that trust, either by scamming your friends or other questionable behavior, then it may be time to cut ties with them. Unfriending someone isn’t a nice thing to have to do, but it’s at least a simple process if you need to do it. If they’re an active user, go to the player’s profile on the Roblox website or app, then click the “Remove Connection” button. If you are following that player, you can also click the three-dot menu on the user’s page and select “Unfollow”.</p><p>Suppose the user is banned, temporarily or permanently? In that case, you can find their profile by navigating to the Following or Followers tab on your <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/following" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Connections page</a>, which we’ve provided a link to here for your convenience. From here, you can find the user whose profile box will be deactivated if banned.

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en">annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, Square Enix released two new trailers for Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, providing new looks at the two HD-2D games launching this December and next year, respectively.</p>



<p>The Octopath Traveler 0 trailer, which can be watched below, provides a quick look at the game's story and setting, highlighting how players will return to the continent of Orsterra and witness a tale of beginnings. This tale will be made more engaging to experience with some new gameplay features never seen before in the series, like the ability to customize the main playable character, new town building mechanics, and enhanced turn-based combat where players will be able to bring eight characters at the same time, over the four that could be brought in the first two entries in the series.</p>

<p>While much different from Octopath Traveler 0, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales will have plenty to offer to fans of classic role-playing games besides the gorgeous HD-2D visuals. The new Tokyo Game Show trailer shared today provides a solid overview of the action-focused experience, which looks like a modern take on the classic top-down ARPG formula seen in older entries in The Legend of Zelda series.</p>

<p>Scheduled for release sometime in 2026, and with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">playable demo publicly available on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, I wasn't surprised that a more recent build of The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales wasn't available during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>. My disappointment, however, was made easier to bear by having the chance of testing out Octopath Traveler 0 before its launch on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch. Although my time with the game was short, preventing me from getting deeper into the town building mechanics, it was more than enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved/">appreciate some of the enhancements to the series formula</a>, especially the bigger combat party,. which are set to open a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p>
