		<p>Thank you to everyone who said hello at PAX East. Once again, we had a wonderful meetup over the weekend, even if we discovered the hours for the bar had changed since last year. Oops! Then again, who <em>doesn't</em> like hanging around a hotel bar that won't serve you a beer? (I'm sorry, I will double check next year.) It was also a delight to be in the audience to hear <em>Giant Bomb</em>, at one point an independent gaming publication, will once again be an independent gaming publication. Difference this time, of course, is that it's worker-owned. In last week's weekend newsletter, I said my piece about that prior to knowing what would unfold and I stick by it: I don't care if "your" <em>Giant Bomb </em>died years ago, be happy <em>Giant Bomb</em> is still alive<em> </em>for those who want it.</p><p>-pk, who is getting excited to set up the pool in the backyard soon</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>HOP. SHOT. FROG. COSTUME. LET'S. DO. THIS.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – My wife and I needed a long minuteafter the passing of our longtime dog, Pixel. She'd been with us for nearly as long as we'd been together, and the closing months of having her were...well, unpleasant. It was a rough stretch for everyone. But enough time has passed that we're considering moving into the getting-a-family-dog phase, which prompted a discussion between Rob and I about what goes into picking out a dog.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Hopshot [The Finale?]</em> – I said I'd buy a frog costume if I didn't finish Hopshot last week, and by god, I have stood by that promise. If you'd like to see what it's like to play a super hard platformer about a gay frog with a gun while wearing a costume that barely lets you see, join us tomorrow morning.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends </em>– We were at PAX East last week, so it seemed like a good time to chime in with some cool stuff we saw <em>at</em> the show.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll get Janet back into the mix, try not to talk about <em>Clair Obscur</em> for another two hours, pick up on some loose threads from PAX (i.e. <em>Giant Bomb</em>), and more. My interviews from PAX will hit next week.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Civilization VII</em> – War is over. Unless we want more, as a treat?</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – Topic TBD, as per usual. Maybe I'll debate Rob further on the merits of the crab cake. </li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

This optional battery preservation option will instead see the device max out at around 90 percent. This means that if you have the setting on, your battery will rarely, if ever, be fully charged, costing you some playtime when out and about. So why would anybody choose to use it? </p><p>Well, because its really good for the Switch 2's rechargeable lithium battery. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gridx.ai/knowledge/what-is-battery-degradation-and-how-to-prevent-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gridx.ai/knowledge/what-is-battery-degradation-and-how-to-prevent-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">These types of batteries can degrade over time</a></span> if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://You should let the battery get all the way down to 0 percent before recharging False  Strangely enough, batteries are under the most strain when they’re fully charged or completely empty. The real sweet spot for a battery is 50 percent charge as that means that half of its moveable lithium ions are in the lithium cobalt oxide layer and the other half are in the graphite layer. This equilibrium puts the least amount of strain on the battery, and extends the number of charge cycles it can withstand before degrading.  So really, if you were super-keen on keeping your battery living as long as possible, you should keep its charge between 20 and 80 per cent. This means that it spends as little time as possible with lots of lithium ions crammed into either layer, a situation which causes the layers to expand, putting physical strain on them. “But if you did that you’d only be getting about half as much charge every time you used it,” Griffith says. Maybe not, then.  Charging past 100 percent will damage your battery True (but not for the reason you think)  This one is closely linked to the above myth. Charging your phone so it stays at 100 percent overnight isn’t great news for the battery, but that’s not because you’re cramming in more charge than it can handle. A “trickle charge” mechanism cuts off the charger after the phone has reached 100 per cent charge, and only tops up the battery when it drops down a little.  The problem is that you’re keeping the charge level at 100 per cent which, as we know from the previous myth, puts the battery under a certain amount of strain. “It’s not good,” Griffith says, “but the battery manufacturer has set [the battery’s limits] it so it shouldn’t be harmful.”&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://You should let the battery get all the way down to 0 percent before recharging False  Strangely enough, batteries are under the most strain when they’re fully charged or completely empty.

This is why you shouldn’t leave a phone or tablet plugged in overnight to charge while you sleep, as it can quickly ruin your battery and make it die faster.</p><p>Sacrificing 30 minutes to an hour or so of Switch 2 battery time in exchange for a device that will last longer and hold a charge better for years to come seems like a smart trade.

Dbrand has plenty to choose from, including options for most models from Apple, Samsung, and Google. If you own the iPhone 16 Pro Max, you can’t go wrong with Dbrand’s popular Grip Case. Along with support for MagSafe and Camera Control, it features clicky buttons and military-grade impact resistance. The same case is also available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can customize the appearance of most Dbrand cases with additional patterns, though these typically increase the price. The company is known for producing ultra-thin cases and skins--so if you're looking for a bit of added protection that doesn't add bulk to your smartphone, there's bound to be something that catches your eye.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Dbrand+Sale+-+Save+Up+To+50%25+On+Cases+For+Steam+Deck%2C+iPhone%2C+PS5%2C+And+Other+Gadgets&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-12+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-12+15%3A32%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6531467&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fiphone-16-pro-max-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrand-sale-save-up-to-50-on-cases-for-steam-deck-iphone-ps5-and-other-gadgets%2F1100-6531467%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iPhone 16 Pro Max: Grip Case (Matte Black)</a> -- $48.85 ($55)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Dbrand+Sale+-+Save+Up+To+50%25+On+Cases+For+Steam+Deck%2C+iPhone%2C+PS5%2C+And+Other+Gadgets&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-12+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-12+15%3A32%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6531467&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fgalaxy-s25-ultra-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrand-sale-save-up-to-50-on-cases-for-steam-deck-iphone-ps5-and-other-gadgets%2F1100-6531467%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Grip Case</a> -- $48.85 ($55)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Dbrand+Sale+-+Save+Up+To+50%25+On+Cases+For+Steam+Deck%2C+iPhone%2C+PS5%2C+And+Other+Gadgets&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-12+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-12+15%3A32%3A36&amp;fnarticle_id=6531467&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrand-sale-save-up-to-50-on-cases-for-steam-deck-iphone-ps5-and-other-gadgets%2F1100-6531467%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Grip Case</a> -- $48.85 ($55)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-ghibli-movies-limited-edition-steelbook-blu-ray-best-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530746/">Studio Ghibli Movies With Collectible Steelbooks Are Available For Cheap</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/8bitdo-best-controllers-amazon-restocks-tariffs/2900-6514/">8BitDo Halts US Shipments Due To Tariffs, But You Can Get Great Controller Deals (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/">You Won't Find Switch 2 Consoles On Amazon, But You Can Get Games &amp; Gear</a></li>   </ul> </div>

It’s in some ways fitting, then, that the 2025 GOTY contender includes optional challenges inspired by <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s most infuriating minigames, like chocobo racing and lightning dodging in <em>Final Fantasy X</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Throughout players’ journeys in <em>Expedition 33</em>, they’ll encounter Gestral Beaches which are home to unique minigames from playing volleyball to climbing massive skyborne towers. Completing them rewards you with swimsuits, which offer no tangible benefits beyond having more outfits to choose from. Some of the challenges are now infamous, in part because they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/gameonysus.bsky.social/post/3lokou7d7ac2s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/gameonysus.bsky.social/post/3lokou7d7ac2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lean into some of the worst parts of the game</a></span>, focusing on movement and demanding platforming precision when the controls aren’t really designed for it, and also because they are often ridiculous and require an absurd amount of dedication for no real gain. </p><p>Sandfall Interactive game director Guillaume Broche explained the inspiration behind them in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent podcast interview</a></span> with YouTuber Xavier “MisterMV” Dang (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>). It’s in French, but the gist is that he liked how certain minigames of the past were so bad, they live rent free in our memories forever. He referenced the chocobo race and lightning dodging in <em>Final Fantasy X</em> specifically. The final race requires players to get a time of 0:00 by collecting only blue blitz balls, which in turn requires using the least responsive steering controls of any PlayStation 2 game in existence. The lightning minigame, meanwhile, requires successfully dodging bolts of electricity 200 times in a row without missing. </p><p>Both are notoriously infuriating tasks, though unlike in<em> Expedition 33</em>, they are necessary to unlock two of the strongest weapons in the game. Is that better or worse? “There’s a kind of hatred but love that can be felt,” Broche said (via a Google translation of the interview). He added, “If you make a rotten game that you have rotten minigames [in],  well, it doesn’t work too well, but if you have a game that you were attached to and you have this kind of challenge, a little bit extra on the side...it’s funny.”</p><p>He admitted the Gestral Beaches were his idea—“I personally insisted on putting them in the game and so yes, Gestral volleyball, if you want to insult me, ​​it’s me, I’ll take it”—but some fans are praising the development team for achieving the desired effect with the annoying challenges in an otherwise excellent game. “Spent an hour climbing the vertical tower one, and got Monoco’s swimsuit at the top,” one player wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kiohbe/game_director_guillaume_broche_when_asked_who/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a></span>. “There is no better possible reward for all of that pain than something as hilariously asinine as Monoco in a speedo. It is just absolute perfection, totally carries the spirit of those old stupid FF minigames. I love that they’re there. I love that they’re stupid. I love that I have the music stuck in my head forever now. THIS is quality and love from the developer.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-roles-daggerheart-age-of-umbra-mini-series-debuts-at-end-of-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role's Darrington Press has released new details on <em>Daggerheart</em> Age of Umbra. The anticipated actual play mini-series will showcase the tabletop publisher's in-development fantasy TTRPG, spotlighting its dark fantasy setting.</p>

<h2><em>Daggerheart</em> Age of Umbra Details Revealed</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Darrington Press reveals what fans can expect from the <em>Daggerheart</em> Age of Umbra mini-series. As part of its original announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in February</a>, the campaign will be set in a dark fantasy world contained in the <em>Daggerheart</em> core rulebook.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-core-rulebook-promo-image.jpg?itok=WKumsJGI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-core-rulebook-promo-image.jpg?itok=17c-14G6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That land is the Halcyon Domain. It is a place where the souls of the dead are cursed to return in twisted, nightmarish forms. Alongside these horrors are the Umbra, an ethereal force that corrupts all it touches. The only ways people survive in this land are from Sacred Pyres staving off corruption, and tightly knit cooperation. But there are whispers of ancient secrets and power to be found by the brave few.</p>

<p>The world of <em>Daggerheart</em> Age of Umbra will be brought to life by GM <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer</a> and will feature Critical Role co-founders Ashley Johnson, Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fed64e82-f78a-4671-979b-0de0f235fb5e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers" rel="nofollow">Sam Riegel</a>, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc0a217-e28f-4919-887d-2ef0511e836a" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/taliesin-jaffe-talks-asha-of-critical-role-downfall-monk-builds-and-what-ashton" rel="nofollow">Taliesin Jaffe</a> as players. The game will be a high-stakes story, exploring themes of hope and survival in a world where death is only the beginning.</p>

<p>There are several dates for the <em>Daggerheart</em> Age of Umbra mini-series. The series will debut on Critical Role's official Twitch and YouTube channels as well as their dedicated streaming platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-beacon-fall-line-up-including-new-season-of-rooster-teeth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beacon</a>.</p>

I love the song, both on its own, and as a companion to Gotye and Kimbra's 2011 bop "Somebody That I Used To Know.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gotye - Somebody That I Used To Know (feat. Kimbra) [Official Music Video]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UVNT4wvIGY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Gotye's "Somebody That I Used To Know" was a angsty teenage anthem at my high school lunch table. The four-minute song — equal parts alternative rock, indie pop, and bossa nova — is a bitter reminiscing of a romantic relationship's messy end. In it, Gotye's lyrics, taking on the role of a spurned male ex, highlight every wrong done to him, painting his former partner in the corner as the bad guy. This is a point conveyed starkly in its music video which sees him facing the camera butt ass naked, indignantly laying every hard feeling out on the table while facing an unseen audience like a breathing tapestry in the Louvre. At the same time, Kimbra stands with her back turned to an unseen audience.&nbsp;</p><p>For many of the guys in my friend group, myself included, Gotye's verse hit a little too close to home. We saw ourselves in his heartbreak, convinced we had no hand in how our week-to-month-long romantic relationships fell apart. We fashioned ourselves as Scott Pilgrim paragons, making the same mistake Scott Pilgrim does in the comic. Our exes were at fault for everything — end of story.<br></p><p>When Kimbra's verse came, it was as if we collectively plugged our fingers in our ears and went "lalalala," unwilling to hear her side. She might as well have been Charlie Brown's teacher trumpeting in the background of the song's chorus. Meanwhile, the girls in our friend group, desperate for us to have a come to Jesus moment, patiently remarked about the song's narrative shift beyond Gotye's self-righteous lament — usually in the middle of our roundtable lunchroom chats or when we passed the aux cord around en route to whatever fastfood spot won the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to their Buddha-like patience, we eventually recognized that the song’s timelessness lay in the beauty of its dialogue — lyrics depicting a breakup where Gotye clung to his manpain while avoiding reckoning with his shortcomings. It also didn't help Gotye's case when my friends pointed to the song's music video as proof of his narrative crumbling when Kimbra steps out of the confines of the tapestry he's painted them into, faces him head-on, and verbally lays out the receipts of their mutual break up from her perspective.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over<br>But had me believing it was always something that I'd done<br>But I don't wanna live that way<br>Reading into every word you say<br>You said that you could let it go<br>And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>His immediate, reflexive flinch and unwillingness to meet her gaze only pushes him further into his self-made illusions about how their relationship unraveled. With time, our debate over who was <em>right</em> subsided, overshadowed by the raw emotional divide. A divide made more prominent when Gotye cuts Kimbra off with the song's aggrieved chorus, ironically chastising her for cutting him off.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams and Sumney's "I Like It I Like It" echoes its <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/moses-sumney-and-paramore-hayley-williams-come-together-for-new-song-i-like-it-i-like-it-listen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">angsty thematic core</a>, acting as an emotional successor.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Moses Sumney &amp; Hayley Williams - I Like It I Like It [Lyric Video]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5OB461GCD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the song's deceptively affectionate title, "I Like It I Like It" isn't a celebration of blossoming love. It's the red flags of its slow unraveling.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike "Somebody That I Used To Know," this song's protagonists recognize their fading interests in real-time, realizing that their premature and performative displays of affection are more for the camera than for each other. This is visually reinforced through their matching hairstyles and restrictive leather outfits posing in a barren desert, manufacturing intimacy in glossy editorial style photographs. As camera flashes go off, they pose like Vogue models, yet their empty expressions reveal the truth behind their facade. The poetry behind their initially emphatic romantic declaration is a cry for help with how draining their connection has already become.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Its chorus—a simple, infectious refrain—repeats its declaration like a mantra: "I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it / I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it / I like it too much." But beneath its harmonic charm, there's a sharp contradiction. A harbinger lies in plain sight, signposting their affection as one so intense it becomes suffocating. The relationship in "I Like It I Like It" is one where every unspoken discomfort between its singers lingers unchecked, to the point of festering, transforming from fleeting icks into palpable resentment. Rather than mere red flags, these misgivings turn into evidence, pushing them toward the realization that maybe, just maybe, they fell too hard, too fast.</p><p>Its lyrics capture the emotional whiplash of a romance that burns too bright, too fast, where passion mutates into hesitation and attraction into suffocating doubt with individual lyrics where Sumney states "A kiss on the cheek every time that we meet / I turn cactus when we touch, touch" prompting WIlliams replying in kind, singing, "And no matter what you're doing to me, I keep it to me / 'Cause honesty is a boner killer." Unlike the argumentative prattling in "Somebody That I Used To Know", "I Like It I Like It" dovetails into a duet where both parties mutually agree that they're on the outs.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I don't wanna sing if it's all a dream<br>That means nothing to you<br>And my lips clutch when you open up<br>'Cause I don't know what to do</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Much like André 3000 calling listeners out, saying "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgvGjAhvIw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Y’all don’t want to hear me, you just want to dance</a>" in OutKast’s "Hey Ya," both "Somebody That I Used to Know" and "I Like It I Like It" mask the emotional baggage of their uncomfy lyrics beneath an irresistibly catchy song. Like a pop song Trojan horse, the volatile lyrics of "I Like It I Like It" wave the same red flags from an obsessive, emotionally charged relationship, charting the course for the same indignant falling out of Gotye’s 2011 breakup song. “I Like it I Like It” could be a pre-breakup song, even. In between musing over how angelic Williams and Sumney's voices are, I hope the youngins will wise up to the telltale signs of their angsty romances being too similar to these songs quicker than I was when I was a lad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron"><h3>We’re In The Era Of The Business Idiot</h3></a><p>"We’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We found out <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/">earlier this year</a> that Stellar Blade would be arriving on PC this June, but we didn't have a specific release date at the time.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to someone at PlayStation hitting the 'publish' button a tad early on the company's official YouTube account, we know that Stellar Blade will be available on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store on <strong>June 11, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The trailer was posted to the official PlayStation YouTube account and removed shortly after, but not before it could be downloaded and posted to the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">Reddit page</a>, where you can still check it out.</p>
<p>Besides the release date, the trailer shows off Stellar Blade running on PC, and confirms that it will support NVIDIA's DLSS 4 AI upscaling and AMD's FSR 3. It also confirms that the PC version will support ultra-wide displays and that you'll be able to play it with full DualSense haptics and adaptive trigger support.</p>
<p>We also get a quick look at a new boss battle players will be able to tackle, 25 new outfits added for the game's protagonist Eve, and some shots of the better textures and graphical features PC players will be able to enjoy, assuming, of course, they have the hardware to do so. Also, while the trailer doesn't explicitly confirm it, PS5 players should expect the new boss fight and outfits to come to the console version when the PC version releases in June.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the most anticipated action games of 2024, impressing players with its intense combat and stunning visuals. When it debuted on console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Wccftech's reviewer Kai Tatsumoto called Stellar Blade</a> "<em>a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-demo-coming-soon-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blades of Fire is due to arrive next week at the time of writing, launching on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 22, 2025. But if you wanted to give Blades of Fire a go ahead of that launch, developer MercurySteam and publisher 505 Games have announced that a demo will be made available "<em>soon</em>" on all platforms ahead of next week's launch.</p>
<p>The studio posted <a href="https://x.com/Blades_of_Fire/status/1921943453123899660">a short video on X</a> featuring clips of players commenting that they want a demo to try the game out before jumping into the full release, and MercurySteam is making it happen. The studio hasn't said when the demo will be available, though with the game releasing towards the end of next week, it's likely it'll arrive a few days prior to help build excitement towards the game's full launch.</p>
<p>Revealed just months ago, the narrative-driven fantasy action game puts all its focus on the weapons you use and how well you know how to use them, meaning you won't be able to rely on stat upgrades and endgame-strength weaponry to make it through even late-game encounters in Blades of Fire. Your <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/">skills and knowledge of the weapons</a> in the game will get you through to the credits more than anything else.</p>
<p>Even though we've only known about Blades of Fire for a short time, the game is catching plenty of eyes. It was a pleasant and unexpected surprise during this year's GDC, where we got to go hands-on with the game about a month after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/">spending an hour with Blades of Fire at the conference</a>, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote, "It's<em> just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven't seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I'd still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd</em>."</p>

In the long run, which upgrade paths you prioritize will be based on which guns and abilities you vibe with the most. But the game’s opening hours throw a lot of options at you with limited upgrade resources, so I figured I’d fill you in on the upgrade paths that I found offered the most value as I acclimated to the game’s pacing and expectations. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196742,195579" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#shotty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#shotty">Combat Shotgun upgrades</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#pulv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#pulv">Pulverizer upgrades</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#flail&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#flail">Flail upgrades</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h115674"><a id="shotty"></a>Combat Shotgun: Incendiary, Smelt, and Tune Up</h2><figure id="" data-id="f43742c1033930e3117228e899749148" data-recommend-id="image://f43742c1033930e3117228e899749148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Combat Shotgun upgrade path." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Combat Shotgun upgrade path." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->id Software / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f43742c1033930e3117228e899749148" data-recommend-id="image://f43742c1033930e3117228e899749148" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Combat Shotgun upgrade path." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Combat Shotgun upgrade path will be one of your first available options, so you’ll probably be eyeing it either way.

This will keep you in the fight longer.</p><p><strong>But it’s really the Tune Up upgrade you’re aiming for, as it turns your Combat Shotgun into a tri-burst weapon</strong>. You’ll eventually get even more powerful weapons, but those three-round bursts from the Combat Shotgun can make very quick work of mid-tier demons you’ll encounter during the game’s first few hours. </p><h2 id="h115675"><a id="pulv"></a>Pulverizer: Runic Skull and Runic Strike</h2><figure id="" data-id="952b283162c0debe02bc7e4cbbfd52b0" data-recommend-id="image://952b283162c0debe02bc7e4cbbfd52b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1043" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pulverizer upgrade options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pulverizer upgrade options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->id Software / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="952b283162c0debe02bc7e4cbbfd52b0" data-recommend-id="image://952b283162c0debe02bc7e4cbbfd52b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1043" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Pulverizer upgrade options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll obtain the Pulverizer relatively early in the game, and it’s a hell of a gun to keep around. It’s designed to function as a crowd control weapon that can clear out groups of smaller enemies due to its wide spread, but you’d be shocked at how much damage it can do to large demons when you get close enough to unload all of those shots into them.</p><p>With its high damage potential and versatility, you’ll want to grab upgrades for the Pulverizer as soon as possible. The two you’ll have available early on include Runic Skull and Runic Strike. The former makes it so that your gun’s Charge increases after killing an enemy with the Pulverizer or melee, which in turn provides you with faster movement and a higher rate of fire so that you can mow through foes even quicker. The latter makes it so that melee attacks build and maintain your Charge, making you an unstoppable force with this powerful gun.</p><h2 id="h115676"><a id="flail"></a>Flail: Conditioning, Ignite, and Resonant</h2><figure id="" data-id="8be5defc004a429b3250738fd183c391" data-recommend-id="image://8be5defc004a429b3250738fd183c391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the melee upgrade options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the melee upgrade options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->id Software / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8be5defc004a429b3250738fd183c391" data-recommend-id="image://8be5defc004a429b3250738fd183c391" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the melee upgrade options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Flail makes an appearance a few hours into the game, and it’s a very strong melee option to keep equipped. While it charges slower than your Power Gauntlet, it makes up for it with increased utility. As soon as possible, go ahead and grab its first three upgrades: Conditioning, Ignite, and Resonant.</p><p>Conditioning reduces the charge time of the Flail, while Ignite scorches enemies and causes them to drop ever-important armor to increase your survivability. But the Resonant upgrade is the star of the show, increasing the damage your Flail attacks do to metal shields and armor, which both stand in your way of dealing flesh damage to demons. Oh, yeah, and it also drops armor for you with each hit. If you can’t tell, I’m all about that survivability, baby!</p><hr><p><br><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/football-heroes-league-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newest title from Run Games, <em>Football Heroes League</em>, is a fun and fast-paced 2 vs. 2 co-op experience where you go up against friends in a match of soccer (football for our international readers). We got to go hands-on with this at PAX East, so read on to check out our <em>Football Heroes League</em> preview!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League </em>Preview - A Love Letter to Soccer&nbsp;</h2>

<p>What sets <em>Footballl Heroes League </em>apart from other soccer games is its sense of on-the-field presence and the special abilities that each hero has. Where a game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fifa-21" rel="nofollow"><em>FIFA</em></a> gives you a bird's-eye view of the field, the <em>Football Heroes League </em>developers wanted to capture that feeling of being on the field yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My background is, I'm a soccer player," Run Games Creative Director Michael Marzola told me. "I've been playing it my whole life, it's a giant part of my life. I wanted to bring something to gamers where it feels more like playing real soccer, when you're running down the field and you have that tunnel vision."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A game of&nbsp;<em>Football Heroes League</em>&nbsp;starts as a routine soccer match, but each of the current five heroes (with more on the way) has special abilities that the player can unleash at any time. The current slate of heroes includes Kenzo, Frostine, Beckers, Bun-E, and Leo.</p>

<p>During my preview, I first played as Leo, a hulking lion man with abilities that allow him to leap great distances and charge, and then as Frostine, gliding around the field on an iceflow.</p>



<p>Adapting to the opposing team kept me constantly changing direction and redirecting my offensive and defensive strategies, especially when an enemy Frostine would surge forward with her Glacier Glide, creating a path of ice through the air that she slides on to get ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marzola still plays in a soccer league, but his inspiration to make <em>Football Heroes League </em>comes from the inescapable fact of getting older.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My wife keeps asking me to quit, saying I'm going to tear my ACL," Marzola said. "I realized I don't have that many years left to play, so this is a love letter to soccer fans and also to myself to say, 'This is something when I'm old and gray, when I'm 80 years old, I can still play this when I can't play the real thing.'"&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League </em>&amp; Global Influence&nbsp;</h2>

<p>With how ubiquitous soccer is around the world, Run Games was able to leverage its international team to put everything they had into <em>Football Heroes League</em>. The team initially unveiled <em>Football Heroes League</em> at Gamescom Latam in Brazil and were thrilled to see the fan feedback they were receiving from a part of the world where soccer is so huge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marzola brought up a photo the team took with a young boy at Gamescom Latam and told me how he would play <em>Football Heroes League</em> again and again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He played probably 30 times," Marzola said. "Every time he'd play, he'd go to the back of the line to play again. We had these trophy matches, and when he won his trophy his dad had us all autograph it for him. It was honestly one of the best moments in my game-development career, and I've been making games since 2000."</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League</em>&nbsp;Preview - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Football Heroes League</em> was an unexpected delight on the PAX East show floor, one that I went back to multiple times even after my initial preview appointment was finished. The matches are quick, and it's easy to jump into<em> Football Heroes League t</em>o play a quick session if you don't have much time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The abilities of each hero make <em>Football Heroes League </em>feel more like a battle royale than a soccer game, while still showcasing crisp and reactive soccer gameplay that makes this experience stand out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Football Heroes League </em>is currently in early access and free to play on Steam with a promise of more heroes to be released over time. For the dev team, this was a total dream to be able to work on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This game for me is a dream project, a passion project," Marzola said. "It's something that I feel so lucky that I'm able to share with the world. It's genuine. It's not just business; it's business and art."</p>

But even though the latest entry in the long-running franchise is not even out yet, fans are already looking beyond it to the series’ future. Specifically, many want to know if <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> <em>Underground </em>and <em>Underground 2 </em>will get fancy remakes one day. According to Tony Hawk, he wants those remakes, too, and will “campaign” to make them real. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195752,195618" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654"><em>THPS 3+4 </em>is  an upcoming remake</a></span> of the third and fourth entries in the <em>THPS</em> franchise, which were released in 2001 and 2002 respectively on PS2. The games are incredibly popular and received rave reviews back in the day. But for many fans, the best game in the series is the one that followed those two: 2003's <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> <em>Underground</em>.

I’ll campaign all I can, but I’m working with a much bigger company that’s a lot smarter than me.” </p><p>When <em>ScreenRant </em>pushed again, asking if Activision has hinted that it wants to do a <em>THUG </em>remake after <em>THPS 3+4</em>, Hawk responded: “Yeah, we haven’t even released this game.” Which is...totally fair. </p><p>Still, I do hope that Hawk is able to convince Activision to remake <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766/slides/13?_gl=1*1ykfm13*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766/slides/13?_gl=1*1ykfm13*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw"><em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em></a></span> and its sequel at some point.

Sure, you can argue that they also marked the end of the series’ classic era and likely set the franchise on a course that would lead to worse sequels, but that doesn’t change the fact that <em>THUG</em> is a fantastic skateboarding game that would likely be a hit these days. The kids love open-world games and zany antics. They’d likely dig <em>THUG</em>. But I’m not holding my breath, as it took Activision five years to finally give us more <em>Tony Hawk</em> after the success of <em>THPS 1+2</em> in 2020. </p><p>In other <em>Tony Hawk </em>news:<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/598275/tony-hawk-pro-skate-3-4-remaster-bam-margera&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/598275/tony-hawk-pro-skate-3-4-remaster-bam-margera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bam Margera is going to be a secret skater in <em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span><em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">This follows reports that Hawk pressured and demanded Activision</a></span> and the devs to include the skater in the game after he had cleaned up his life. </p><p>You’ll be able to play as Bam, Hawk, and a bunch of other skaters when T<em>ony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> launches on July 11 on Xbox, Game Pass, PlayStation, Switch, Switch 2, and PC.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Loyalty and member drops, "X" amount per household, invitation-based preorders and re-stocks are all solid way's to control Pokémania.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is only a few retailers are doing this, making it easy for scalpers and bot groups to snap up stock. Retailers such as Costco seem quite happy to let chaos ensue as human beings fight each other for bits of cardboard. Common sense doesn't float with these kinds of people, so restraints and control need to be put into place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If retailers started implimenting these measures and TPC begin to flood the market with enough product for everyone to enjoy, it would make a more accessible hobby for everyone. For collectors, values of legacy chase cards would eventually climb as sealed stock goes out of print anyway, everyone wins. Well, bar the scalpers, but screw 'em.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Enjoy the moments of Remembrance.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is a game steeped with lore. Story details are everywhere, from traditional cutscenes, environmental details, conversations with NPCs, and yes the FromSoft classic: even buried within item descriptions. But Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different type of FromSoft game: It’s an online-driven co-op PVE game with roguelite elements. That makes it a bit difficult to deliver the usual kind of FromSoft narrative. So how is the story in Nightreign conveyed? Well, let’s talk a little bit about Remembrances. Read on and/or watch the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So to start, let’s break down what the story of Nightreign even is. And who better to break that down than game director Junya Ishizaki:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention – it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition. It needs something to oppose it, and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s the setup that brings together our eight different character classes who are gathered from all across Elden RIng’s world. Nightreign’s story is more about filling in the details of who these eight characters are, what are their motivations, what was their past before having this responsibility thrust upon them to defeat the Nightlords. And to learn that, we have the Remembrances. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the stops the player can make at the Roundtable Hold in between matches of Nightreign is a journal in the library where you can view your current character’s Remembrances. Some of these are just journal entries that reveal a little bit of information about the character’s backstory. However, some of them are playable snippets of a moment from the character’s past. When you launch into a playable Remembrance, there will be a hazy dreamlike border around the screen, and you’ll be transported to the location of the memory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After talking with an NPC within a Remembrance, you’ll gain a personal objective. These will differ from character to character and Remembrance to Remembrance. For some, like the Ironeye for example, your personal objective might be to launch into a match, travel to a specific marked location, and then defeat a miniboss that will only appear there if the Remembrance objective is active. Once you do, you’ll gain an item that you can bring back into the flashback, return to the NPC, and then you’ll be able to move forward to the next chapter of that character’s story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The objectives themselves vary between classes and Remembrances. Wylder, for instance, instead of having to fight a boss, might have to find a specific item located in a cavern, which is a location you might not generally go due to the risk of being stuck there when the ring starts closing in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Raider, who has a completely different style of Remembrance. He gets transported away from the Roundtable Hold and must participate in gladiatorial-like 1-on-1 battles against a variety of bosses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting and very unique departure when it comes to storytelling for a FromSoft game. I personally have only gotten a small taste of these individual character storylines, but what I’ve seen and played through so far has me eager to see more once I get my hands on the full game. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
