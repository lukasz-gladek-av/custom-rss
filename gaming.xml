<p>Now that most of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have been released, it's clear that they give AMD and Intel their best opportunity this decade to claw back some market share and make the dedicated graphics card business a little less lopsided.</p>
<p>It's not that the 50-series GPUs have been&nbsp;<em>bad</em> cards, but a focus on sometimes-useful, sometimes-not AI-generated frames and a lack of major manufacturing advancements relative to the 40-series have eroded Nvidia's usual lead in performance and power efficiency.</p>
<p>That's the advantage AMD is trying to press with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/amds-299-radeon-rx-9060-xt-brings-8gb-or-16gb-of-ram-to-fight-the-rtx-5060/">the new Radeon RX 9060 XT graphics cards</a>, which at $299 and $349 for 8GB and 16GB are both priced and configured to comprehensively undercut Nvidia's RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti. As with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/">RX 9070 series</a> earlier this year, the RDNA 4 architecture goes a long way toward addressing the RX 6000 and RX 7000-series' lackluster ray-tracing performance and mediocre power efficiency, and a relatively affordable 16GB version will help insulate buyers from the RAM limitations that are slowly but surely becoming more of a problem for 8GB cards.</p>
<p>With the usual 2025 GPU caveat—the difference between a "good" GPU and a "bad" one is whether you can actually find one and buy it for anything close to the list price—let's dive into one of the few genuinely exciting midrange GPUs we've gotten in a while.</p>

<p>On paper, the 9060 XT series looks a lot like last generation's RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT. All of those GPUs have 32 of AMD's compute units, and all are connected to either 8GB or 16GB of GDDR6 via a 128-bit memory interface.</p>
<p>But AMD says that each RDNA4 CU is much more capable than in previous architectures—when the 9070 series was introduced, AMD said that an RDNA4 CU could render roughly twice as fast as an RDNA2 CU or 2.5 times faster for ray-tracing workloads. The RX 7600 and 7600 XT only improved over the RX 6650 XT by a few percentage points, but the 9060 XT should be a bigger upgrade.</p>

<p>The 9060 XT's Navi 44 silicon is also manufactured using a 4 nm TSMC process rather than the 6 nm process used for the 7600 series. You can already see that in the lower total board power (TBP) figures for both cards: The 16GB 9060 XT starts 30 W lower than the RX 7600 XT, and the 8GB 9060 XT starts 15 W lower than the vanilla RX 7600.</p>
<p>The cards' power consumption will vary slightly based on the settings your GPU's manufacturer uses and what settings you select in the Tuning section of the Adrenalin software. Officially, AMD publishes a range of TBP figures for the 9060 series rather than a single default number. For the 8GB card, that range runs from 150 W to 182 W; for the 16GB card, it ranges from 160 W to 182 W.</p>
<p>AMD says the 150 and 160 W baselines should represent the ideal spot on the efficiency curve, where performance-per-Watt is greatest. But OEMs can choose a higher default to try to squeeze out a bit more performance, and users will generally be able to set their own GPUs to operate at the bottom or top of that TBP range using "favor efficiency" or "favor performance" buttons in the Adrenalin app.</p>
<p>As long as your card is being adequately cooled, a card with a higher TBP should be able to maintain higher clock speeds for a bit longer, boosting performance. Presumably, using a higher TBP setting will also improve the cards' overclocking headroom somewhat, but you'll also be at the mercy of the silicon lottery.</p>

      The 9070 and 9060 cards both have "tuning presets" that change the maximum TBP level of the card.

<p>Our ASRock review unit shipped with a default TBP of 170 W, and all of our testing reflects that slightly higher-than-baseline TBP. It only has a single 8-pin power connector, and we'd bet that most GPUs from most of AMD's partners ship the same way.</p>
<p>One nice thing for users of slightly older systems is that the 9060 XT uses a full 16-lane PCI Express 5.0 interface. The GPU does not <em>need</em> 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 bandwidth, but older PCs that only support PCIe 4.0 or even 3.0 should still have sufficient bandwidth for it, something that has occasionally been an issue for midrange cards that have shifted to eight-lane PCIe interfaces.</p>

<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>Our gaming testbed uses the same configuration we've been using since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/review-nvidias-geforce-rtx-5090-is-the-first-gpu-that-can-beat-the-rtx-4090/">the RTX 5090 review</a> earlier this year. It's powered by an eight-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which is way, way more CPU than you need for any of these midrange GPUs. They will generally perform just as well with any relatively recent Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor. But it ensures that the CPU is never limiting the GPU, eliminating one important variable when we see slow or otherwise weird results in our benchmarks.</p>
<p>We tested the 9060 XT mostly at 1080p and 1440p resolutions and compared it primarily to the last-generation Radeon RX 7600, 7600 XT, 7700 XT, and 9070; Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060, 5060, and 5060 Ti; and Intel's Arc B580. Where available, we've also included some results for older cards—the the GeForce RTX 3060 and 3070 and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT—to give people a sense of what they can expect if they haven't upgraded their GPU in a few years.</p>
<h2>Performance and power consumption</h2>


<p>The 8GB and 16GB versions of the 9060 XT are basically drop-in replacements for last generation's RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT, which, despite the "XT" in the name, were mostly the same GPU with 16GB of RAM instead of 8 GB. We only had the 16GB version of the card available to test, but we can make some broad assumptions by comparing the 8GB and 16GB versions of the 7600 and seeing which games seem to struggle disproportionately with less RAM.</p>
<p>At 1440p, the 9060 XT usually runs between 22 and 62 percent faster than the RX 7600 XT in games without ray-tracing effects enabled. That's a solid generational jump that makes a strong case for the 9060 XT as an entry-level 1440p GPU. These $300-to-$400 GPUs have been marketed primarily as 1080p cards for a long time, and the 9060 XT will also pair well with a high-refresh-rate 1080p monitor, but people looking to play games at 1440p for less than $400 have a good option here if they can find this card at or near its list price. The 9060 XT isn't quite as fast as a last-generation RX 7700 XT (originally $449) or RX 6800 (originally $580, in 2020 dollars), but it comes pretty close.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          



<p>In games with ray-tracing effects enabled, the 9060 XT soundly beats the 7700 XT and 6800 and runs some games like <em>Cyberpunk</em> around twice as fast as the old 7600 XT. Nvidia still has a small edge here—the 9060 XT is slightly faster than the RTX 5060 but slower than the 5060 Ti. But AMD has narrowed the gap quite a bit, to the extent that ray-tracing isn't nearly the liability for AMD that it once was. You may or may not care about these fancy lighting effects, but some games are already beginning to require ray-tracing support, and it's likely to become more common over the next few years.</p>


<p>Compared to Nvidia's offerings, the 9060 XT sits right in between the $299 8GB RTX 5060 and the supposed-to-be-$429 16GB 5060 Ti. It generally outperforms the 5060 by a small but consistent margin across the board (the one exception being in <em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, where Nvidia cards still generally do better than AMD's), and it generally loses to the 5060 Ti by 10 or 15 percent. Given that 16GB 5060 Ti cards are actually going for closer to $500 right now, the 9060 XT at $349 is still a more economical choice if you can find one.</p>
<p>One important win for AMD here: The 16GB 9060 XT is usually 40 to 60 percent faster than 2021's RTX 3060. If you have one of those cards, you're probably still getting decent performance out of it. But AMD is offering&nbsp; a relatively affordable upgrade path that bumps you up from 12GB of RAM to 16GB rather than making you step down to 8GB, as both the RTX 4060 and 5060 do. If you have a 3060 and you're looking for a relatively affordable way to play more games at 1440p or at higher settings, AMD's new card might get you there.</p>


<p>As for power efficiency, the 9060 XT is a huge improvement, consuming roughly the same amount of power as the 8GB RX 7600 or Nvidia's RTX 3060 but performing considerably faster than either. The 5060 Ti still has a tiny edge here—power consumption is similar, and performance is a tiny bit better—but as with ray-tracing performance, the gap has closed enough that it's no longer a strong selling point in favor of Nvidia.</p>

<h3>Is 8GB enough?</h3>
<p>If you frequent any of the tech YouTube channels that traffic in GPU reviews, you'd think that 8GB cards are pointless trash, junk you'd throw in a hole before you'd sully your gaming PC with it. A lot of that complaining—not all, but a lot of it—involves turning a game's resolution up to 4K and all the textures up to Ultra and then pointing out that things don't run, which is a bit like buying a Zippo lighter and complaining that it isn't a flamethrower.</p>
<p>Sure, 8GB of RAM is insufficient in these scenarios, but you're also talking about settings and resolutions that the GPUs themselves would struggle with even with unlimited video RAM.</p>
<p>With all of that said, we are noticing a handful of cases where Ultra settings at 1440p or even 1080p were occasionally challenging for our 8GB cards. Sometimes these issues were on-and-off; cards like the 8GB RTX 4060 would perform fine in a test like <em>Black Myth Wukong </em>on some runs but abruptly turn into a flipbook on other runs. The 8GB version of the 7060 wouldn't run the <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> benchmark at high settings in 1440p at all, and running it at 1080p eventually resulted in either slowdown or crashing midway through. <em>Cyberpunk</em> and even the somewhat less-demanding <em>Returnal</em>&nbsp;struggle more on the 8GB RX 7600 than they do on the 16GB RX 7600 XT.</p>

<p>These are edge cases in individual games, and lowering resolutions or settings resolves the issues. But if you're spending $350 to $400 or more on a GPU in 2025, you should try to avoid 8GB cards if you can. It used to be the case that these low-end-to-midrange GPUs weren't good for much above 1080p anyway, but the 5060 Ti and 9060 XT are both fast enough to be decent 1440p graphics cards when they're equipped with the right amount of RAM. Are the 8GB versions totally pointless? No. But they do leave performance on the table, and the problem will get worse over time.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>The current state of the GPU market</h2>
<p>At this point in 2025's graphics card market, the issue isn't so much that mainstream cards like the 5060, 5070, or 9070 aren't available but that they are rarely available for their stated retail price. This has always been an issue with AMD, Nvidia, and Intel's board partners, who try to add things like fancy cooling, lighting, or marginal overclocks to justify raising the price. But MSRP cards are currently vanishingly rare, and it's hard to know where the 9060 XT's price will <em>actually</em>&nbsp;fall.</p>
<p>Using Newegg listings for cards that are in stock, Intel's "$249" Arc B580 is available for $299 at best. There <em>is</em> one $299 RTX 5060 from Gigabyte available, but the rest of them cost at least $320. The $349 8GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti actually starts at $390, and the $429 version starts closer to $490 new. The $549 RTX 5070 is more like $600 or $610. The $549 RX 9070 starts at $650 instead, and the $599 RX 9070 XT at $720 or more.</p>
<p>You get the picture—you can buy a lot of graphics cards, but the actual prices are somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 to $100 more than they ought to be.</p>
<p>If you're in the market for a GPU and you can actually get the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT at $349, you should do it because it's clearly better and more future-proof than anything else available at that price, and the 5060 Ti's advantages are totally moot when it costs almost $150 more. But be aware of your other options and their actual costs if you can't find anything at the advertised list price.</p>
<h2>Conditionally great</h2>
<p>Imagine a better world with me: Companies that design and manufacture graphics cards announce new products and reveal pricing for those products, and then it's possible to go into a brick-and-mortar or online store and buy those products for the price that was originally announced. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>
<p>But that's not the world we live in, due to many factors: the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">death of Moore's Law</a>, inflation, tariffs and general economic uncertainty, and the fact that companies can make much more money selling GPUs as AI accelerators than they can selling similar silicon to people who play video games.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I feel like a broken record because I've had to devote some portion of <em>every</em> GPU review I've done in the last six months to the Pricing And Availability Situation, but it's just unavoidable at this point. I can review this GPU and its probably-pretend retail price against a bunch of other GPUs and their pretend retail prices, but the actual pricing and availability are a mystery to me.</p>
<p>Take this for whatever it's worth: If all current-generation graphics cards were available at their advertised MSRPs, I'd say the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT is the midrange graphics card to beat right now, a card that most people should buy instead of an RTX 5060 or RTX 5060 Ti. The $299 version with 8GB of memory is also probably fine, but it's worth the extra money to future-proof it—leave the 8GB cards to the pre-built PCs at this point.</p>
<p>What will the RX 9060 XT actually cost when the dust settles? Who knows. But at a baseline, the RTX 50-series is underwhelming, and the RX 90-series is more attractive than AMD's last couple of GPU generations have been. You're no longer accepting a big dip in power efficiency or ray-tracing performance just because you're picking an AMD card. Nvidia can still count benefits like DLSS upscaling and frame generation as advantages, but they're not <em>so</em> invaluable compared to the modern FSR equivalents that they're worth paying a ton of money for.</p>
<p>For the first time in years, AMD feels like it has a midrange GPU offering that I could recommend without caveats—with the caveat that it actually needs to be available at the price AMD is advertising.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great 1080p and solid 1440p gaming performance, at least for the 16GB version.</li>
<li>Fewer trade-offs than past generations of Radeon GPUs, including much-improved power efficiency and ray-tracing performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>8GB version will be held back by its RAM even at 1440p, and those problems will get worse rather than better over time.</li>
<li>FSR 3.1/FSR 4 and FSR frame generation are still not as widely supported as Nvidia's DLSS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RAM limitations of the 8GB version.</li>
<li>The current state of the GPU market.</li>
</ul>

Doom has hijacked the Fantastic Four’s ship multiple times in the comic books, so it’s not far-fetched to believe he might do the same in the MCU. </p><p>We’ll have to wait until July 25 to see if these theories are anything more than just fanboy fantasies. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Neightreign </em>came out last week, and the response was thunderous “it’s OK.” For the first time in a while, FromSoftware has produced a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9racin%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VR game</a> that has been perceived as somewhat mid. And on some level, thank god; <em>Nightreign </em>is healthier and more interesting because it actively does not feel like <em>Elden Ring </em>and is instead a freakish experiment that succeeds more than it doesn’t. It is a game that I liked far more than I expected, one that is slightly confusing, and one that is surprisingly unlike <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>The elevator pitch for <em>Nightreign </em>is “Battle Royale <em>Elden Ring,</em>” which is both disorienting and also sort of quaint in 2025. Aping <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Fortnite </em>was huge for a few years, in a time that seems like an eternity ago. Not only does the game feel charmingly late to the trend, it’s a bizarre fit. Who looks at <em>Elden Ring </em>and thinks “yeah, let’s turn that into <em>Apex Legends</em>?” Had something like this been pitched years ago I would have assumed it was crass, but pulling this now feels like it comes from an earnest place.</p><p>While <em>Elden Ring</em> and its DLC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, are primarily single player games with optional multiplayer co-op and PVP hooks, <em>Nightreign </em>is almost exclusively a three person PvE experience. The option to start as a duo does not currently exist, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers say they’re working on it</a>, and while you can sorta play the game single player, it is clearly not optimized for this experience at all (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-first-major-patch-sees-fromsoft-belatedly-admit-singleplayer-is-all-sorts-of-unfair-adds-an-auto-resurrect-and-buffs-the-levelling-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although they did tweak it</a>). <em>Nightreign </em>is a prequel that takes place in a hyper-condensed version of Limgrave known as Limveld. Three players are dropped Battle Bus style into the world on ethereal birds, although you do not have much of a choice of where you drop. Each round follows a three night structure: Your team must progress through the world as a shrinking ring of fire (known as Night’s Tide) closes in, quickly defeating hyper condensed versions of bosses and foes mostly recycled from<em> Elden Ring </em>and even the <em>Souls</em> games (although many have been retuned for this game). You do this with two rings over two nights, and on the final night you face off against a new and grandiose boss.</p><figure><figcaption>Yeah sure, just throw The Nameless King from <em>Dark Souls 3</em> in there. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>In an attempt to make this game structure coherent and expedient, <em>Nightreign </em>makes several radical changes. The pace is blisteringly fast. You do not need to get on and off of a mount in the game because you are constantly booking it. Fall damage is eliminated entirely, and you can jump up several sheer cliff faces faster than a goat. Additionally, leveling is simplified by the addition of eight distinct characters, known as Nightfarers, that live in a radically different version of the Roundtable Hold from the original <em>Elden Ring</em>. These characters not only have specific affinities based on how weapons scale, they also have three distinct abilities: a passive ability, a regular skill, and an ultimate.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I play Ironeye, an archer, who plays entirely differently than an archer in <em>Elden Ring</em>. For starters, arrows are unlimited now and do not need crafting. Ironeye also has the ability to close distances and tag an enemy with a weak point. This completely changes the pace of a ranged character and encourages you to remain at medium distances to be able to reapply the mark. Ironeye’s ranged weapons, counterintuitively, also give him a cleric-like utility as downed allies can be revived by doing them damage, a system that radically speeds up the pace of co-op.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ironeye, who is the best character, can mark targets or do a sick AoE move where he takes a big ass bow out. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>There are several parts of <em>Nightreign </em>that are either actively abrasive or in conflict with each other. For starters, the game (currently) works best if you are playing with two friends you know, and if you do not have two friends, who you get matched with is the luck of the draw. I have played 24 hours of this game entirely queued with randos, and the experience can be charitably described as “mixed.” Some of this is not their fault: there’s a lot to learn in <em>Nightreign </em>and, like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>before it, it’s not particularly good at onboarding you to the experience. For example, did you know that the weapons in your inventory often have passive abilities even when they are not directly equipped? I didn’t for longer than I care to admit.</p><figure><figcaption>The door to a nightlord. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>If you’re lucky, you get queued up with players who know exactly what they are doing and know the quirks of every zone inside and out. Other times you get a couple of people who think they’re solo gods and just go off into the woods and die (as friend and Aftermath contributor Joshua Rivera called them, “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/elden-ring-nightreign-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of Yahoos</a>”). Thankfully, I have found the general skill floor of players increased quite a bit after defeating the first boss. But even in ideal conditions, the complexity of what you need to accomplish with randos in the game is limited by the communication the game gives you. Pinging points and items on the map <em>Apex Legends</em> style can never match being on voice chat with all your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another point of tension is that while the game pace itself is very fast, the rounds themselves are not short. The combo can feel both exhausting and exhilarating, although that also means that, when you get to the end, if you eat shit at any of the bosses of the three days, you have to start from scratch. This is not entirely a bad thing, because when you do finally take a boss out, the rush is fantastic.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fort....night... Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>There are a lot of things that don’t work all the time in <em>Nightreign</em>. It is a confusing game, in part because it goes against much of the original appeal of <em>Elden Ring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> was thoughtful and sprawling, a game about exploration and discovery. <em>Nightreign </em>feels like five mods stacked on top of each other. “I would describe the <em>Elden Ring</em> experience as more of a journey, while <em>Nightreign</em>'s experience is more of that on the battlefield," <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">director Junya Ishizaki</a> stated in an interview with CNET. Though it uses the same essential combat and enemies, the experience is paced so differently and the moment to moment goals are so alien that it’s hard to call it the same game. It feels less like <em>Elden Ring </em>and more like a game that is wearing <em>Elden Ring</em> like a skin suit.&nbsp;</p><p>It is fair to ask, “who is <em>Nightreign </em>for?,” and I’m shocked to report that it’s a game for me. I’m happy that <em>Nightreign </em>is a lumpy but interesting game, because FromSoftware was built on those. The FromSoft that existed before Miyazaki started hitting it out of the park was a lot of fun; that’s a history that’s often invisible to a lot of people who got on board around <em>Demon’s Souls </em>or <em>Dark Souls</em>. I am old enough to remember these games outside of the context of a YouTube video essay. Games like <em>Chromehounds, </em>both <em>Otogi</em> games and <em>Metal Wolf Chaos</em> were all genuinely fun<em>.</em> Some obviously did not hit, like <em>Ninja Blade </em>and <em>Eternal Ring</em>. One of my fondest memories of Kotaku was trying to get the Kinect-only <em>Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor </em>to work with Evan Narcisse, and that remains one of the most interesting games that sucks that I’ve ever played.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>We did it lads. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>For all its faults, <em>Nightreign </em>feels like FromSoft is having fun. Its lukewarm reception lets the air out of the room just a tiny bit. Like <em>Dark Souls II, </em>it feels like an excuse to let someone else take the reins on a proven franchise and try to do something new with it; in this case, first-time director Junya Ishizaki. And though the result is a little mixed, the experiments conducted here feel like a wonderful training ground for building talent that will inevitably bear fruit (like how <em>Dark Souls II</em> co-director Yui Tanimura would go on to co-direct <em>Elden Ring</em>). <em>Nightreign </em>is a little lopsided, a tiny bit confusing, alienating to much of its player base, and far more interesting than I expected it to be. In it, you can see the seeds of something beautiful germinating.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling"><h3>Finally, A Letterboxd For Wrestling</h3></a><p>Dropkickd puts criticism and community back in the hands of fans at whatever point of their wrestling journey

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"With the original Switch, we were pushing right at the edge of what was possible," explains Hello Games co-founder Sean Murray in the video. "No Man's Sky on Switch 2 is just a huge leap forward. The extra horsepower, it allows us to add full multiplayer for the first time on Switch 2. Cross save and cross play are there from day one, allowing players a seamless experience across devices."</p><p>The Switch 2 Edition is launching at the same time as No Man's Sky's latest free update, Beacon. One of the new additions in Beacon is the creation of robot cities, which Murray notes would have been impossible with the original Switch. He also noted that the Switch 2 version is launching with nine years of No Man's Sky updates and support.</p><p>Players who already have No Man's Sky for Switch can get the Switch 2 upgrade for free. That's unusual because every other Switch 2 Edition has been a paid upgrade. However, some games are getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-switch-games-and-updates-from-todays-nintendo-direct-available-now/1100-6524364/" data-ref-id="1100-6524364">free Switch 2 updates</a>.</p><p>No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition will be released on June 5 as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch titles for Nintendo's new system</a>. The previous No Man's Sky update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-relics-update-lets-you-build-skeletons-from-ancient-bones-however-you-wish/1100-6530383/" data-ref-id="1100-6530383">Relics</a>, allows players to reconstruct skeletons and create unique species from archeological fossil beds. Hello Games added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-finally-has-a-cross-save-feature-with-latest-patch/1100-6527633/" data-ref-id="1100-6527633">cross-save functionality</a> to the game late last year.</p>

                <p>The original Nintendo Switch has long been a popular way to play Fortnite, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2's beefier specs</a> will bring the battle royale experience more in line with how it looks and feels on other platforms, with a frame rate and resolution boost at launch, and the promise of mouse controls coming in a later update.</p><p>Epic Games shared details about the Switch 2 version on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Fortnite blog</a>, detailing the major improvements that players will experience after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">upgrading to the new console</a>. Unsurprisingly, the most significant enhancement is to the game's frame rate--Fortnite will run at 60fps on Switch 2, whereas the game was stuck at 30fps on the original Switch.</p><p>Resolution will also get a major boost, going to 2176x1224 docked and 1600x900 undocked. The Switch 1 version of Fortnite ran at 1560x880 docked and 1170x660 in handheld mode after a 2021 update. Additionally, the Switch 2 iteration of the game will sport "greater view distances," along with higher-quality textures, shadows, and water rendering.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873"></a><figcaption>Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2 boasts 60fps gameplay, better draw distance, and increased resolution.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Unlike the Switch 1 version, this release supports the game's Replay system and the console's Capture button. Like many multiplayer titles that will be on Switch 2, Fortnite will support the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-feels-better-than-it-looks/1100-6532016/" data-ref-id="1100-6532016">GameChat feature</a>, allowing players to stream their gameplay to three other friends.</p><p>After a patch drops on June 7, players can use one or both of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">Joy-Con 2 controllers as a mouse</a> in menus and battle royale gameplay--Epic did not list Lego Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, or other non-BR game modes as supporting mouse controls. The only glaring omission on Switch 2 is the Save the World game mode, which was also not purchasable on the original Switch version of Fortnite.</p><p>If Switch 1 owners transfer their data to a Switch 2, they'll have to delete the original "Fortnite for Nintendo Switch" from their console and download the Switch 2 version on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">the reportedly more responsive Nintendo eShop</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> might still be lacking an early access release date beyond a vague "2025" window, but that hasn't stopped Unknown Worlds from cranking the hype handling a little harder, with the studio having now shared a few additional details as part of a new video Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
Last time around, Unknown Worlds offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">first, fleeting look at Subnautica 2 gameplay</a>, but for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">latest video update</a>, creative producer Scott MacDonald and community manager Donya Abramo tackled a couple of burning fan questions. Admittedly, most of them ended with 'not yet', 'maybe at some point', and 'no', but there were still a couple of facts to glean.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most notable tidbit came in form of confirmation that Subnautica 2 will ditch the controversially chatty protagonist of 2021's standalone expansion Below Zero and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game, although that doesn't mean other characters won't be voiced. The decision accompanies the introduction of customisable characters, with players able to select from a handful of pre-designed protagonists before diving in. Unknown Worlds notes there'll potentially be some further "freedom to express yourself as your character", but whatever that means, it won't be util after early access launch.

<p>
As for the world of Subnautica 2, it's set on a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", and Unknown Worlds says it's aiming for the game to be the "biggest and most exciting" series entry "ever" when it hits 1.0 in a few years time. It isn't, however, exactly sure "how big and how deep [players will] be able to go over the course of early access", but says the initial early access launch map will be more sizeable than those of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and Below Zero at a comparative time.
</p>
<p>
And a vast new underwater world to explore means vehicles. Unfortunately for fans of the Cyclops, Seamoth, and even the Sea Truck seen in earlier games, none of those are returning for the sequel. However, Unknown Worlds says new vehicles are coming - including a big sub scheduled to arrive later in early access - that'll be "designed in the same spirit [as their predecessors], just more suited to the brand-new environment they need to navigate". Additionally, "some of your favourite tools [will return], but improved", and base building is set to offer "more customisation than ever before".
</p>
<p>
What else? The studio stresses that, despite supporting co-op for up to four players, Subnautica 2 is being designed as a solo experience first. That means it should retain the sense of "isolation and terror" that made the original such a winner, although the studio readily admits it "won't really be able to protect" that atmosphere if players opt to bring friends along for the ride. Sadly, there's no local split-screen option for those wanting to cuddlefish up on the couch, but cross-play is supported between Xbox and PC platforms, and as for proximity chat, that's currently being 'investigated'. VR support isn't on the cards at present, however.
</p>
<p>
And all of that brings us back to the big question of a release date, but Unknown Words says it's "not quite ready to share one just yet". Nor is it talking platforms beyond PC and Xbox, only teasing Subnautica 2 will hit other machines "when the time is right". It is, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">still scheduled for a 2025 release</a>, and will be available as part of Game Pass on day one.

			<p>Another video game to film adaptation has been announced, and this time it's horror movie powerhouse production company Blumhouse announcing that it is collaborating with Kinetic Games to make a Phasmophobia movie.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-film-adaptation-blumhouse"> blog post from Kinetic Games</a>, with the studio's director Daniel Knight saying he is "<em>thrilled</em>" for Kinetic Games to be working with Blumhouse and James Wan's production company, Atomic Monster, on this project.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasomphobia film adaptation is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting</em>," said Knight.</p>
<p>"<em>We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops</em>."</p>
<p>No directors, writers, or cast members have been attached to the film so far, but in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game is a match made in heaven</a>, so is Blumhouse and Atomic Monster taking on any film adaptation of a horror video game, including Phasmophobia. Hopefully, we'll hear more about the film soon.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p>And on the newer side of things, <em>Fortnite </em>is also launching support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature</a> as well as support for the console’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls. While Epic has already pushed the <em>Fortnite </em>update for folks who have gotten their hands on the Switch, support for mouse controls — which work in Battle Royale, Zero Build, Team Rumble, Reload, and Fortnite OG — isn’t set to launch until June 7th. June 7th also just so happens to be the day when <em>Fortnite</em>’s ongoing <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season comes to an end with the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle">Death Star Sabotage live</a> event, which is probably going to look at lot better on the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor.</p><p>All of this might not seem too special to people who have been playing <em>Fortnite </em>on other consoles, but it truly cannot be stressed enough how <em>not great </em>the game has looked on the Switch in the past. Mouse controls aside, these updates might not change gameplay all that much, but they’re going to make squadding up a much, much more enjoyable experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't forget — beware of spoilers!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>, the multi-chapter sequel to 2015's indie smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, is currently blowing up on Steam thanks to the release of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 this morning after years of anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/31/undertale-creator-announces-and-releases-mysterious-new-project">out in some format since 2018</a>, when creator Toby Fox posted a series of cryptic tweets before dropping an innocuous download entitled "SURVEY PROGRAM." That download turned out to be the first chapter of a new game, Deltarune, the name of which is an anagram for Undertale. After a cryptic introduction, the player controls a teenager named Kris who, with their school bully Susie, is dropped into a mysterious Dark World and tasked with saving its citizens by a goat-child named Ralsei.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">second chapter manifested in 2021</a>, revealing something like an adventure-of-the-week format where Kris and Susie repeatedly visit the Dark World in each chapter, meet a new villain, defeat them alongside Ralsei, and return home. In total, the game is expected to have at least seven total chapters, and we've known three and four were coming today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june">since Fox announced it in April.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune, like Undertale, is a turn-based RPG with bullet hell mechanics, and features a cast of both new and returning characters from its predecessor. However, its connection to Undertale itself is mysterious — the characters themselves have key differences from their Undertale versions, no one seems aware of the events of Undertale, and yet the game frequently winks and nods to Undertale's events in a way that players of both will recognize, even if its in-universe cast doesn't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is beloved for its zany humor, lovable characters, unique combat, and fantastic soundtrack, much of what fuels the nearly-rabid online interest is related to the mystery of what, precisely, Deltarune <em>is</em>, and how it will ultimately connect with or solve some of the latent mysteries of Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this writing, Deltarune already has over 100,000 players on Steam and is the 10th most-played game on Valve's platform. It's already surpassed the peak Steam player count of the free Deltarune Chapter 1 and 2 demo, despite costing $25. It's the top-selling game on Steam right now by revenue, ahead of the likes of Counter-Strike 2, Elden Ring: Nightreign, and Dune: Awakening. But its true popularity will be much bigger, given Deltarune is also out on PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series consoles now, and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions launch tonight at midnight when the Switch 2 officially releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>The not-E3 week is about to begin as Sony readies a PlayStation State of Play broadcast for 10pm UK time (11pm CEST / 2pm PT / 5pm ET) tonight. We'll cover the broadcast live right here, reporting the major talking points in case you're out walking the dog or stuck somewhere else, and you can also - hi regulars! - assemble in the comments to watch along and chat with us.</p>
<p>What do we expect to see? Sony hasn't said much. We know the broadcast will be an enigmatic "40+" minutes long, but Sony hasn't mentioned anything about content beyond "the show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe", which isn't very helpful. But it does leave us free to speculate.</p>
<p>Fairly safe bets include seeing gameplay for the October-bound samurai sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as well as something from Kojima's baby-powered walking game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, although note that there will be a separate Death Stranding 2 showcase this Sunday, 8th June.</p>
<p>We're hopeful of seeing more of the Wolverine game made by Spider-Man dev Insomniac, we've seen some rumours swirling about a possible 2.5D God of War game, and there are the perennial calls for a remake of Bloodborne. Will our dreams finally come true?</p>
<p>Also, Donlan would like a new Ape Escape game. Thanks.</p>
<p>Summer Games Fest gets into full swing as we approach the weekend. The opening broadcast will happen on Friday night and there's a busy weekend of shows to follow. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest 2025 hub</a> has all the times and dates you'll need.</p><figure>

Oh dear, the full conference running order appears to have been leaked. I suppose there's no point watching now.
