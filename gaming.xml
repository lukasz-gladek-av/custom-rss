            <p>
Grotesque and surreal 'farming simulation' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> has been banned from the Epic Games Store on the eve of release, a couple of years after a work-in-progress version of the game was rejected by Valve. In an alleged statement to developers Santa Ragione, the Fortnite makers explain that they've found the game to be in contravention of policies against "Inappropriate Content" and "Hateful or Abusive Content". Given that, according to Santa Ragione, Epic have had access to a build for two months and had already approved the game for publication on their store 18 days before launch, the whole thing feels like a frantic response to Valve's claims about the unfinished build, which Epic presumably haven't seen. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the statement attributed to them, Epic's content reviewers also say that when they piped their findings about Horses through a questionnaire supplied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Age_Rating_Coalition">an international age rating NGO</a>, it told them the game should be rated Adult Only. Horses has already been rated 18 by the Pan-European Game Information system and M for Mature by the Electronic Software Ratings Board, as displayed on the EGS <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Coming Soon page</a>, which is still live as of writing. 
</p>
<p>
AO games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store unless - as the attributed statement reminds us - they've only been rated Adult Only because they have blockchain, NFT or cryptocurrency technology. This is totally fine, because none of those things are reprehensible or controversial, and besides, they probably make more money for Epic than bizarre and disturbing artworks about people dressed as horses.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2iW4SW03F3OfnoXn4E3f4Uf9HXrImI0PqKlr_Syqk8/edit?tab=t.0">According to Santa Ragione</a>, Epic informed the developers that they won't distribute Horses about 24 hours before release, and denied a subsequent appeal 12 hours later. Here's the full reported statement about the ban from Epic, which was sent to RPS over email.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"We are unable to distribute HORSES on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. The 'Inappropriate Content' policy prohibits content which "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated." The 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology)."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The developers say they don't know for sure what pushed Epic to act, but offer a bit of speculation. "Following the announcement of Steam's ban, HORSES became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition," they write. "It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself." Regarding Epic's attributed comments about policy infringement, they write that "no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines".
</p><p>
If you're catching up with all this, Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">went public about Valve banning Horses from Steam around a week ago</a>. According to the developers - with partial confirmation from Valve - Steam's reviewers rejected the game after submission of an unfinished build they felt featured "content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor". 
</p>
<p>
While Valve have offered no further details in public, Santa Ragione speculate that this statement refers to a scene of a farm supplier's daughter riding the shoulders of an enslaved naked woman in a horse mask. They have both rebutted Valve's initial suggestion that the game might contain child sexual abuse material, and changed the scene following Valve's review to make the character a twenty-something woman. They note in general that the scene "deals with the societal structure" of the game's world, and that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." 
</p>
<p>
I've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">reviewed the finished game</a> (at possibly indulgent length - maybe have a toilet break before you dive in) and as regards the final version of that scene, I don't consider this to be any kind of child pornography. I've included screens of it below to give you an idea. To give some broad context, Horses is about violent structural repression and the punishing of sexuality. The "horses" are people deemed to be so immoral they deserve to be treated like livestock. The game is not an endorsement of anything it depicts.
</p>



<p>
As with their response to Valve's rejection of the game, Santa Ragione argue that all of this is just modern-day puritanism in action. "We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists," they write. "Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. These bans passively shape which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship."
</p><p>As with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">payment processor crackdown on "adult" or "NSFW" games</a> from earlier this year, my takeaway is that another large corporate institution is reluctantly pantomiming the role of public guardian. As their on-going support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/oct/24/surge-uk-savings-lost-investment-scams-fake-crypto-fraud">scam-ridden technologies</a> with a considerable <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/static/documents/Emerging_Digital_Assets_Forrest.pdf">environmental cost</a> suggests, Epic aren't really interested in safeguarding morality - it's just a role thrust on them by their control of distribution. I imagine the key equation here is one of reputation management vs likelihood of a CSAM lawsuit vs opportunity for profit.</p>
<p>

Anyway, we'll mail Epic a request for comment. In the meantime, Horses can still be found on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?srsltid=AfmBOoqFrez0g8LRFGKzFB7RvQFaECoPNhRBncRp9ZNhk8_QHZtZ2HQ9">Humble</a>, <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TheBurntPeanut has been on a monumental glow-up this year. His escapades on games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders have propelled him to superstar status, and during a recent ‘streamer battle’ on the latter title, he secured a concurrent viewer count of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 100,000 people</a>, a number seldom secured by <strong>any </strong>streamer.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, TheBurntPeanut, who literally streams as an animated peanut, slammed Dr Disrespect and his followers after a slew of comments arose about him ‘moving in’ on Dr Disrespect’s territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-and-dr-disrespect-beef-explained">TheBurntPeanut and Dr Disrespect Beef Explained</h2>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has, in his words, been ‘making jokes’ about Dr Disrespect since ‘day one’. This all goes back to Dr Disrespect’s immense controversy in 2024, which saw him <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admit to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from the platform.</p>



<p>In the months that have followed, Dr Disrespect, who has since returned to streaming and maintains a solid following, has preached his innocence on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut is at times a scandalous creator who has had to bite his tongue to avoid making ‘cancel-worthy’ statements, but where Dr Disrespect is concerned, it’s <strong>open season </strong>for the vtuber.</p>



<p>The most recent comment from TheBurntPeanut wasn’t at all veiled and was borderline inflammatory:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been making jokes since day one about Dr Disrespect, I think they think since I’m big now I’m encroaching on his territory.</p>



<p>I’m on ARC Raiders not<strong> the playground</strong>, you got nothing to worry about!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip:</p>

<p>TheBurntPeanut is up for streamer awards after a year of immense success that has pushed him to the forefront of the industry. He’s incredibly entertaining and has already gained a cult following, which means comments like this <strong>do not </strong>go unwitnessed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Season 01 Battle Pass To Have ‘Improvements’ For The First Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-01-battle-pass-improvements/</link>
            <guid>1371274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 4, Season 01 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone (like the fifth time it has had a ‘Season 01’) will be released worldwide, granting players an all-new Battle Pass to experience across two tiers. As always, there’s the standard Battle Pass and the BlackCell Battle Pass, both of which include dozens of rewards, boosts, and bonuses.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post, the Activision team uncovered fresh changes coming to the Battle Pass system, which have been dubbed the first ‘improvements’ ever to be introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-are-coming-to-the-call-of-duty-battle-pass">What Changes Are Coming to the Call of Duty Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>It was revealed recently in a Call of Duty blog post that when the Season 01 Battle Pass drops on December 4, it’ll land with improvements, the likes of which have <strong>never been seen </strong>before.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spiel from the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-battle-pass-blackcell-bundles#Improvements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock Timing:&nbsp;</strong>The team has taken learnings from&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey. The result: each season’s Battle Pass in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Shorter Initial Pages:&nbsp;</strong>Earlier pages in the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content at the end of the page, while later pages in the Battle Pass will contain more rewards. This means players will earn more high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Pass Tokens via Daily Challenges:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, players will have the ability to earn Battle Pass Tokens through completing Daily Challenges, which are now available not only in Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, but also Co-Op Campaign and Endgame (another first!) On certain days in the season, completion of your bonus Daily Challenge will grant you a Battle Pass Token, which can be used right away.</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that the first few pages in the Battle Pass will be shorter and will have a faster completion rate, which means you’ll feel like you’re getting more rewards right off the bat. The further along the Battle Pass you get, the longer the pages will become, which kind of makes perfect sense.</p>



<p>Additionally, for the first time, Battle Pass Tokens will be unlockable via daily challenges that are completable across all game platforms, including the campaign and ‘Endgame’ modes. This will make it easier to get those all-important tokens to grind through the Battle Pass tiers.</p>



<p>The full patch notes for the Season 01 update should be available later today, so stay tuned.</p>

Of course, many stores have been setting up the Christmas cheer for months now (this writer was seeing bedecked trees in shop windows back in October), but, as of today, the Nintendo Museum is finally following suit.</p>
<p>As shared in a post on the museum's official <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1996112175342195124">X</a> account, the lights will be on every night from 4pm JST until close (7pm), and they'll be sticking around in the grounds until the not particularly festive date of 27th April 2026.</p>
<p>While it is far from the kind of display we might expect from Disney Land — or, perhaps more accurately, Super Nintendo World — there's enough Mushroom Kingdom flair here that our nerdy Christmas spirits are sufficiently warmed.</p>
<p>Nintendo has only revealed the two photos of the display at the time of writing (one above and one below), but look! It's cute!</p>

<p>Alongside the lights, the Nintendo Museum has also plonked a Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary plaque next to the warp pipe photo op, which feels like... a very Nintendo way of marking the occasion.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pcjsy3/eidos_montreals_current_state_cancelling_several/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> on Reddit's r/gamingleaksandrumors channel, renowned developer Eidos Montréal appears to have laid off more employees for the third time in less than two years.</p>



<p>The first time was in January 2024, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the new Deus Ex project they had been working on got canceled by parent company Embracer Group. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the project was then shopped around to other publishers, but none picked it up because they felt it was too niche.</p>



<p>At the end of March 2025, Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost another 75 employees</a> after its work on Playground's Fable reboot ended. Now, the number of people who just lost their jobs is unclear, but their CVs reveal that the Canadian studio had been working on a now-canceled dark fantasy action roleplaying game focused on melee combat and parkour, based on the revival of an established vampire franchise. Needless to say, this appears to be a fairly obvious reference to Legacy of Kain.</p>



<p>The IP originally created by Silicon Knights and later developed by Crystal Dynamics has been dormant for a long time, following the unsuccessful multiplayer action game, Nosgoth, developed by Psyonix and published by Square Enix. Three years ago, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-confirms-taking-control-of-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain-and-other-ips-from-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained the rights</a> to Legacy of Kain (as well as Tomb Raider and other IPs) from Square Enix. Shortly after that, Phil Rogers, then CEO of both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-fans-rejoice-eidos-heard-you-loud-and-clear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major tease to fans</a> that the vampire IP would not be left to waste.</p>



<p>It seems that an attempt was indeed made, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remastered release of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2</a> was likely part of a broader strategy to revive interest in the IP; however, the project was ultimately scrapped. According to the unearthed information, the studio also canceled a 'modern point and click game with turn-based combat', while the status of another project, a 3v3 competitive eSports game taking place in a futuristic setting, is unknown.</p>



<p>Eidos Montréal hasn't released a game of its own since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, which debuted in October 2021. They did, however, co-develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounded 2</a> with Obsidian Games, and apparently, that part of their outsourcing work is still active. </p>



<p>Still, it's a shame they are unable to make a new game in once high-profile franchises like Deus Ex and Legacy of Kain. This inevitably casts a shadow on the storied studio's future.</p>

            <guid>1371259</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warhammer 40,000 setting contains some pretty advanced technology. Blackstone Fortresses can destroy entire solar systems. The Aeonic Orb contains the power of an entire sun. And — get this — the Speranza, a massive vessel the size of a continent, can actually manipulate a black hole and fire it. Ouch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, the Warhammer 40,000 setting has galaxy crushing might under its belt. But, it seems, the various races of the 41st millennium still don’t know what’s going on <em>inside</em> a black hole. And that’s not just the Imperium of Man letting the side down, either. It seems no-one — not even the incredibly advanced Necrons — have managed to work it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from one of the latest Warhammer 40,000 novels, Guy Hayley’s Archmagos. It stars the much-loved 10,000 year-old dominus of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Belisarius Cawl, who travels to a Necron tomb world trapped on the event horizon of a black hole. And so, Belisarius Cawl ends up talking about black holes in general, and it’s this bit that surprised me as I was reading the book.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/archmagos-1764702308241.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Archmagos, by Guy Hayley.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Warhammer 40,000 novel Archmagos follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on in the book, Belisarius Cawl ruminates on the big knowledge gap the races of the Warhammer 40,000 universe have when it comes to black holes. During this metaphysical ponder, he speculates that humanity, even during what’s called the Dark Age of Technology (the largely unexplored time period in which humanity was at its technological zenith), had no idea how they work. And, most surprising of all, neither do the Necrons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Necrons, for the uninitiated, are terrifying mechanical warriors who wiped out an entire race of star gods long before the Emperor was even conceived (if he was, indeed, conceived). They’re meant to be the most technologically advanced of all the xenos, and use weapons far beyond our understanding. And so I was somewhat surprised to learn that the physics at play inside a black hole are a mystery to the Necrons, as they are to us in the real world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what Belisarius Cawl, "the galaxy's pre-eminent mind," as he puts it, has to say about black holes:</p><blockquote>Nobody really knows what these things are, even me. If we were to fall within, would we be destroyed, or would we emerge in some other place? I have never come across a satisfactory answer from any species. I doubt our ancestors at the height of their technology understood them. Some ancient Necrontyr records I... came into posession of by completely legitimate means, say they believe them to be the graves of their mightiest star gods. Maybe that is true. Why not? If a star can birth something with the power of a god, then why wouldn't an astronomical body like this harbor similar secrets?</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There was something grounding about reading this section of the book, something that made the often bizarre and unknowable Warhammer 40,000 universe ever so slightly relatable. The human race today does not know what goes on inside a black hole. I mean, we have theories, but we're largely stumped. A black hole could lead to a new universe. Some think a black hole could lead to a white hole. Personally, I love the black hole leads to a 4D representation of a magical bookshelf idea. The point is we just don't know. And it felt comforting somehow to learn that even 40,000 years in the future, we still haven’t worked it out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A glance online at my usual 40k hideouts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1pbuvii/in_the_grim_darkness_of_the_far_future_you_still/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threw up a debate over this</a>. I know — shock horror! — Warhammer 40,000 fans have something to say about the realism of the sci-fi universe they love so much. Some are pointing out that the C’Tan — those star gods I mentioned earlier — are said to have been able to call black holes into being. So if the Necrons defeated the C'Tan and ripped off their tech, shouldn't they have black holes all figured out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And others are pointing out that the Necrons, as they've been described to us in prior Warhammer 40,000 novels, are able to use black holes pretty effortlessly. "But... we have literally entire cryptek branch of black hole science called Voidmancers, they can just make black hole with wave of a hand... wear them as capes... it's just author who didn't know anything about it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1pbuvii/comment/nruczou/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared Mastercio</a> before quoting from a book. "So we have entire group of them being able to just channel black holes, but this book just say that they can't... bullshit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Belisarius Cawl is not saying that the races of the 41st millennium are unable to use a black hole or interact with one in various ways, just that they don’t really understand their inner workings — literally what’s going on <em>inside</em> of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/gettyimages-1237093074-1764702472748.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">What's inside a Warhammer 40,000 black hole? No-one knows, not even the Necrons. Illustration by Nicholas Forder/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me onto the next thought: in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, what <em>is </em>going on inside a black hole? Having a bit of fun here, perhaps Warhammer 40,000 black holes have something to do with the warp, the alternate dimension hellscape in which the Chaos gods rile each other up and demons plot to tear into realspace and end all life as we know it. Maybe if you were to actually venture into a Warhammer 40,000 black hole, you’d end up in Grandfather Nurgle’s garden for a spot of (probably very bad for you) tea. Or perhaps you’d find yourself the inadvertent star of a Slaaneshi sex show. The mind boggles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with most things Warhammer 40,000, not knowing the truth of a thing is all part of the fun. Belisarius Cawl's drive-by lecture on the nature of black holes should be considered as reliable as 90% of the lore fans like me fuss over on a daily basis. That is to say, not very reliable at all. And Games Workshop, as is its want, could one day decide to contradict everything Cawl says here and show us that someone somewhere in the Warhammer 40,000 universe knows exactly how black holes work inside and out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Trazyn the Infinite has had a peek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>According to new filings, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is set to own the vast majority of EA if the proposed record-breaking acquisition goes through.</p>
<p>These filings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">discovered by the Wall Street Journal</a>, have been made to Brazilian antitrust regulators. These filings suggest that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would own 93.4 percent of the video game publisher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is making this attempt to acquire EA alongside private equity funds Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump.  Silver Lake would own 5.5 percent, while Affinity Partners would own 1.1 percent.</p>

The acquisition itself is record breaking due to the absurd $55bn cost attached to taking the video game giant private.

The Public Investment Fund will still need to put up billions of dollars to actually take ownership of EA once it is approved over the next year or so.</p>
<p>CEO of EA Andrew Wilson spoke on the deal, stating: "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games is at a "make-or-break" moment in the studio's history, and needs Mina the Hollower to do well.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a game I have had my eye on since I started at Eurogamer. In fact, I think its announcement was one of the very first articles I wrote for the site. In a first for the company, Mina the Hollower has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of adorable but feisty mouse Mina as she sets out to save a cursed island from the perils that have befallen it.</p>
<p>The game features a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world. And, a lot rides on its success when it comes out next year.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As detailed in a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), in the time since Shovel Knight, Yacht Club divided its team in two (with one team set to work on an unannounced 3D version of Shovel Knight which it had "been fantasizing about for years", and one to work on the "less ambitious" Mina the Hollower). Yacht Club also moved into a new office in Los Angeles. However, then the pandemic hit in 2020, and Yacht Club like the rest of us had to adjust to a different way of doing things.</p><p>Work on Mina the Hollower didn't progress as quickly as the studio had hoped, and in 2024, Yacht Club acknowledged that the two-team structure wasn't working, and after laying off some staff and cutting back on other expenses, merged back into one team. The studio's focus was now solely on Mina the Hollower, and work on the Shovel Knight sequel was paused. The project also had a change in leadership, with studio founder Sean Velasco taking over as director from Mina the Hollower's brain child Alec Faulkner, who is said to have clashed with some of his team.</p>
<p>And now, it is "make-or-break for sure," Velasco has admitted. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," he said of Mina the Hollower. "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great."</p>
<p>However, if the studio only sells around  100,000 copies of Mina the Hollower, "that's not so good". The studio founder did say that if Mina the Hollower were to "flop", then Yacht Club Games would still exist, but it would require some kind of cash injection fast. The studio is already taking steps to keep the studio afloat, and will be moving to fully remote at the end of the year. It will also be shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>"What we're doing in the future is try to figure out ways to have a game come out every couple of years, instead of every five or six," said Nick Wozniak, another Yacht Club founder.</p>
<p>"We haven't released a game in so long."</p>

<p>Mina the Hollower was intended to debut on 31st October, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-developers-zelda-like-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed">was pushed back without a new release date earlier this year</a>. At this time, Yacht Club stated it wasn't "a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p><p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">played the demo for Mina the Hollower on Switch 2 earlier this year</a>, and loved it. "I collected Bonestone, I popped off various goblins and bats, I burrowed my way underneath enemies to spring up excitingly from behind and I negotiated perilous pits, all while bopping along to a gloriously retro-infused soundtrack… Oh yes, I am certainly looking forward to Mina the Hollower's full release," I wrote back in August. This feeling hasn't changed.</p>

                <p>It may come as no surprise that Valve has invested in emulation tech for Arm-based hardware, having just announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-frame-release-date-price-specs-everything-we-know/1100-6536287/" data-ref-id="1100-6536287">first device running an Arm chip</a>.

As it turns out, Valve has had more of a hand in FEX's development than it initially appeared.

      </div>
<p>"We were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts," Griffais explained. "We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since."</p><p>This is backed up by FEX's Ryan Houdek, who thanked Valve in a recent <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">anniversary post</a> for "being here from the start" on the seven-year project. "They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases."</p><p>While Valve has only just revealed its first Arm-based device, the company started thinking about developing for Arm as early as 2016. "We knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries," Griffais said.</p><p>As an open-source tool, FEX is already being used alongside other Valve-supported tech like Proton to power some of the leading PC emulators for Arm-based mobile devices--meaning Valve is quietly leading the push to bring Windows games to your phone without the need for a port. Whether the company has its own ambitions in the mobile space is yet to be seen, with Griffais saying Valve's current focus remains on "living room, handheld, and desktop."</p><p>Valve's support of emulation comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/" data-ref-id="1100-6536209">hard lessons learned</a> when its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine </a>flopped, partially due to its limited library. By investing in technology like Proton and FEX, Valve aims to save developers from having to put in time and resources on ports. "We would way rather have those game developers invest their time and energy into making their games better, or working on their next game," Griffais says. "We think that porting work is essentially wasted work when it comes to the value of the library."</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, the development team behind the free-to-play third-person looter shooter game The First Descendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNh7vwqYdvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in an official livestream</a> to outline the December update and the roadmap for the first half of next year.</p>



<p>The December update adds the new Descendant Ultimate Yujin, who's revealed through Yujin's Descendant Story. Ultimate Yujin features a hybrid playstyle with two Ultimate Skill Modules: </p>



<ul>
<li>Combat Protocol, which introduces a new combat-focused playstyle that lets him sustain his HP while dealing damage.</li>



<li>Battlefield Medic, which offers a support-oriented style that grows stronger the more he assists his allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Players can also explore the new Forbidden Sanctuary dungeon, an experimental facility in Axion that supports multiplayer co-op and features a challenging new boss. The Forbidden Sanctuary offers key rewards for acquiring Ultimate Yujin.</p>



<p>The December update will also introduce The Grim Reaper, a new Abyss Colossus and a mutated form of Death Stalker, which offers a poison-based challenge that requires The First Descendant players to master its mechanics through careful strategy and timing.</p>



<p>Some Descendants, including Ajax, Freyna, Valby, and Viessa, along with select weapons, will also receive balance adjustments to enhance playstyles and skill performance. Moreover, a new Bunny-exclusive External Component, Sprint Accelerator, will be added, and players will be able to trade Ancestors Modules via the Trade Market.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to next year's roadmap, the developers have decided to delay the debut of Season 4 from early 2026 to Summer so that they can perform an overhaul of the core experience and systems. The goal is to provide players with a clearer loop: set a goal, farm and experiment with builds, and then tackle structured endgame, especially on “Hard” and above difficulties. In the meantime, Season 3 will continue with Episodes 3 and 4. Even Episode 2 will get something in January with the addition of Breach Tracking, a gold‑oriented farming activity where fields and missions are selected at random and can also drop items like superconductive cooling units.</p>



<p>Season 3 Episode 3 will go live in February 2026, introducing the beta version of the new Onslaught Mode to The First Descendant. This is a four‑player endgame mode where parties of four players face waves of increasingly powerful enemies, strategically placing turrets and buffs using resources gained during battle. The full version is planned to go live with the May update.</p>



<p>Episode 3 also introduces regular Descendant Dia with a main story centered on her, while Episode 4 adds one new Ultimate Descendant. Late during Episode 4, the developers will revamp Hard-mode Void Intercept Battles, turning this activity into a multi‑tier endgame pillar; until the new variant arrives, deep‑Void bosses will rotate monthly so older skins, cosmetics, and previously unobtainable deep‑Void Descendant skins can be farmed again.</p>



<p>Farming at Hard difficulty and above will be restructured around an Operation Command/Directive system, where players first choose the item they want to farm and then clear assigned missions for rewards, with the entire high‑level farming experience being rebuilt.</p>



<p>The Arche Tuning/Mutant Cell system is also being redesigned from fragmented A/B/C item drops into selectable nodes, making it easier to understand what benefits a Descendant and where to get it. Moreover, Stat display will be overhauled so final damage and contributions from modules, reactions, tuning, and externals can be viewed and “simulated” in one menu, reducing reliance on the lab for testing.</p>



<p>Finally, the team revealed that Season 4, currently scheduled to hit live servers in Summer 2026, brings Karel's final battle arc plus a large‑scale Mega Dungeon that surpasses current infiltration operations and Void Vessels in scope and spectacle, alongside a complete weapon system overhaul and the introduction of Transcendent‑tier weapons with a more farming‑centric, less grindy progression model.</p>



<p>The First Descendant <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in July 2024</a> and immediately garnered the attention of many players who were looking for an alternative to existing looter shooters, such as Destiny 2 or The Division 2. NEXON soon boasted that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been played by ten million users just in its launch week</a>, although it didn't take long for it to start losing steam, which is why the studio is now trying to overhaul the game's foundation.</p>



<p>On a technical level, the game was pretty advanced. It was the first title to integrate Samsung's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Gaming feature</a>, and it was also the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution alongside AMD's FSR Frame Generation on the PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that the former alleges is a "slavish clone" of the Horizon franchise. Now, the two sides have apparently struck a temporary deal ahead of an important court hearing that may determine whether the case goes forward.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing in court acknowledges that Sony and Tencent have been "engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute." Most notably, Tencent asked for more time to respond to the motion for an injunction, and Sony agreed in exchange for certain concessions. The terms call for Tencent to pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram while also agreeing not to argue in court that Sony delayed its request for emergency relief by granting the extension.</p><p>The filing also notes an agreement between the two sides that Tencent won't ask for expedited discovery in connection with the preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram. It also calls for Tencent to hold the game to its Q4 2027 release window rather than moving it up. Finally, the court document revealed another area where Tencent and Sony see eye-to-eye. The two sides jointly requested that a hearing for Tencent's motion to dismiss and a second hearing held for Sony's injunction request be held on the same day: January 29, 2026.</p><p>At the heart of Sony's case is an accusation that Tencent intentionally tried to confuse players by passing Light of Motiram off as a Horizon-related game. Prior to the legal fireworks, Tencent apparently pitched Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">a Horizon game that was set in Asia</a>, which was ultimately turned down. Once the lawsuit was filed, Tencent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">pulled the Horizon-like imagery</a> from the game's Steam page. In court, Tencent claimed that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">get a monopoly on games similar to Horizon</a>.</p><p>Tencent also argued that it wasn't liable for any damages because any previous discussions about a Horizon game or even the development of Light of Motiram were done by subsidies owned or partially owned by Tencent. In response, Sony accused Tencent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-accuses-tencent-of-playing-a-shell-game-to-avoid-liability-in-horizon-lawsuit/1100-6535487/" data-ref-id="1100-6535487">playing a legal shell game</a> to avoid the repercussions of infringing on its intellectual property.</p><p>As these legal maneuvers played out, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-steel-frontiers/" data-ref-id="5000-702414">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, which will be coming to mobile platforms and PC. However, it's rumored that Sony is planning its own Horizon MMORPG for PS5.</p>

                <p>Stranger Things returned for Season 5 Vol. 1 last month, and the series is taking one last bow in the '80s before concluding later in December. Usually, the show is pretty sharp about not making major mistakes in the time period or anachronisms that shouldn't be there. But this time, the show made an apparent goof with an old-school Nintendo game.</p><p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Hawkins' latest home-grown bully, Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly), was playing the notoriously difficult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghosts-n-goblins/" data-ref-id="5000-9758">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a> on his NES. However, the version of the game playing on the screen was actually the original arcade game that was released by Capcom in 1985.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/myretrolifeshow/status/1994560916118278169" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin.

That said, it's also possible that this isn't a mistake and the arcade version of Ghosts 'n Goblins was used on-screen because it's simply a better looking version of the game.</p><p>To demonstrate, this is what the NES port looks like:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P7CdqiHHPpQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Nintendo was a good home console for its era, but it couldn't make the game look as good as it did in the arcade.

<p>Square Enix's new HD-2D RPG starring YOU</p>

Following on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</a> Remake in October, we've now got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which this time puts you in the shoes of your very own custom character.</p>
<p>This game is releasing on the Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December, and ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. It comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what did the critics at this outlet think?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067htquxo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>This new entry in the series, which sees you not only becoming the hero but also rebuilding your home, has received <strong>8/9/9/8</strong> from the four Famitsu critics, giving it a total of <strong>34/40</strong>. In the same week, this puts it two points ahead of Famitsu's score for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (sitting on 32/40) and two points <em>behind</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which leads with a score of 36/40.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> games on Switch, the first and second games both received scores of 36/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the first review for the latest Octopath Traveler game! Once again, you can find out more about it (and see our own score) when our review goes live here on Nintendo Life later today. In case you missed it, there is also a demo available for this title on the eShop, and your save data will carry over to the full game.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3b48478afafae"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b48478afafae/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've finally made it, folks! This week marks the long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. After years of development, delays, and even a restart, Samus Aran's next 3D outing is officially here for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The critic reviews have also gone live ahead of the big release, and admittedly, the aggregate score has got a lot of people talking online. Prime 4 is currently sitting on 81/100 based on 74 critic reviews. At the time of writing, it's got the same "top critic" score on OpenCritic.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194688 @ 1764758361 -->
<p>This score technically makes Metroid Prime 4 the lowest-rated "mainline" Metroid Prime release on Metacritic. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-remastered">Switch remaster</a> of Retro Studios' first game received an aggregate score of 94/100 when it was released in 2023, and every other "major" entry in the Prime series has received a score of 90 or more.</p>
<p>As harsh as all of this may sound, it's still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">an "excellent" adventure in our books</a>, and we're not alone here – with some sites even awarding it a perfect score. Of course, these scores are focused on the Switch 2 version of the game. As you might have seen, we're currently working on getting our Switch review out the door as soon as possible. So be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194682 @ 1764758361 -->
<p>So, with the scores and lengthy wait time for this anticipated release in mind, we want to know if you will still be getting Metroid Prime 4: Beyond this week? Has anything in the lead up to this big release swayed your decision, or will you still be diving in day one? <em>Vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

            <guid>1371190</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is taking a major step forward as it ages into the back half of the decade <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">with the release of its expansion, War Sails</a>. The action strategy game is finally adding naval combat in this expansion, and ahead of its release, I got to spend some time hearing about it from developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.</p>



<p>I also got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">speak with a couple members of the development team, senior producer Falk Engel and design lead Gökçen Karaağaç</a>, all about this expansion and how it changes Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II, and why TaleWorlds Entertainment is calling this its "<em>biggest expansion ever</em>."</p>



<p>I want to start by saying I'm very new to strategy games. I've previously avoided them because whenever I saw gameplay clips, no matter which specific strategy game it was, it all seemed like it moved too slowly for me. I was also concerned with not being able to really grasp the mechanics, and was overall concerned that I would just not be very good at the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_03-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But at the same time, I also knew these concerns were holding me back from an entire genre of video games I knew I might seriously enjoy, particularly when it comes to the strategy games that integrate historical elements into their gameplay. Wanting and willing to finally overcome those concerns is what drove me to Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails, and after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say: I was right to be concerned, I am not very good at these games.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was also wrong to be concerned, because I'm still having a great time. It helps that this feels like a fresh start, not just for me, but for Bannerlord as well. With the release of War Sails, old saves are getting wiped, and it's a fresh new Caladria to explore on land and on sea.</p>



<p>"<em>Mount and Blade has always been about freedom, it's meant to be a blank slate for you to write your own stories</em>," as TaleWorlds Entertainment's Antonio Santo said in the opening to the studio's presentation ahead of release. You can't get more 'blank slate' than new saves.</p>

<p>It feels understandable, then, that the cost of this expansion, which is $24.99 USD at regular price (currently $22.49 with its introductory 10% off sale), is half the price of the base game (when the base game isn't on sale like it is right now for half-price, which means with the base game at $24.99 and War Sails at $22.49, you get both for the price of Bannerlord not on sale). </p>



<p>I won't be going into detail about the War Sails storyline, purely to avoid spoilers and also because I'm not through all of it. What I can say is that while it does take a bit to get going since you need to scale your naval capabilities and party size to really get a feel for it, I now can't imagine playing Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord without War Sails and without naval combat. In a lot of ways, it really does feel like a whole new arm of the game has been added, and can now be improved upon.</p>



<p>Which is to say, there's incredible potential here, and while War Sails perhaps doesn't deliver on everything you'd want right away with the addition of naval combat, it sets a strong foundation for what could be next.</p>

<p>For one thing, the sailing is wonderfully intricate and fun to try to master. Mastering maneuverability with your own ship, and especially with a whole fleet of ships, creates an incredible spectacle in naval battles. Even if most of my battles did devolve into smash-and-board skirmishes mostly, the wonderful backdrops and learning how to navigate the conditions, paired with a strong soundtrack, strike at the core of what Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord does best.</p>



<p>And the battles where I employed more strategy than just a head-on assault were all the more rewarding because of how challenging it was to work against the wind and stormy conditions. Large-scale battles are where Mount and Blade is at its best, and that's true for its land battles, and now, naval battles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, combat isn't the only area of Mount and Blade that was changed with the addition of naval combat. In his presentation about War Sails, senior producer Falk Engel said, "<em>Even before the full release of the main title, we started receiving many community requests for a naval</em> <em>expansion. By the time we had finished our work on the core game, it was clear that this type of content would be one of the best additions that we could make. Why? Because the addition of the naval dimension allows us to build upon the wide range of gameplay and content, without taking from what people already know and love</em>."</p>



<p>Which is exactly what TaleWorlds Entertainment did, as the naval expansion not only introduced naval combat, but also changes to the game's economy, to trading, to the balance of importance between cities. Coastal cities like Chaikand are now even more important as a hub for trade. You even get a new port area you can walk around that's tuned to each nation.</p>



<p>Speaking of nations, War Sails also brings the Nords back into the equation, an inclusion that design lead Gökçen Karaağaç told me was introduced partly for nostalgia, partly because they were "<em>easy to justify"</em> introducing. "<em>Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here</em>," he said in our interview.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Nords_Screenshot_no_logo_01-2-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nords, an entire new area to explore, new campaigns, and an entire new frontier of combat are altogether a sizeable addition to Mount and Blade, though they're by no means perfect. Even with TaleWorlds Entertainment putting out several patches since launch, the odd bug feels bound to happen. Thankfully, it's not been anything too severe, like issues with the game crashing on me consistently; it's been more firmly in the funny, sometimes ruinous, freezes and hitches that, as I said, aren't too bad, but are consistent enough that I expect them.</p>



<p>Of course, they hurt far more when you are, as I did, going against the advice Karaağaç provided, which was "<em>do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose</em>." The stakes are already high enough with how much it means to lose a ship, or multiple ships, in a battle, and especially because most engagements, once you've boarded an enemy ship, can result in unwinnable situations if you're not careful with how you move across the deck of your ship. Losing your ship and the battle because of an untimely freeze doesn't feel great, no matter how you slice it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount-Blade-II-Bannerlord-Screenshot-2025.12.03-00.21.08.001.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But bugs can be patched, and at least in this case, they don't ruin the entire experience. War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers. Hopefully, now, it won't be another five years before the next major expansion.</p>

<figure data-uuid="53de7ecbc26e6"><a title="Starsand Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53de7ecbc26e6/starsand-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Seed Lab</em></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese dev Seed Lab has officially announced that its upcoming cosy life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starsand_island">Starsand Island</a>, is getting a Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release when it launches next year.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in the nebulous "early 2026" and coming to all the usual platforms, that list also now includes Nintendo's latest console, where the devs will be offering two modes depending on your preference: Quality Mode, "targeting 45FPS in 1080p", and Performance Mode, delivering "60FPS in 1080p" in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will also support mouse controls and GameChat during online multiplayer. You can check out the reveal trailer below if this one's passed you by thus far.</p>
<p>Now, it has to be said that we're hardly lacking for great <del>roguelike deckbuilders</del> <del>Metroidvanias</del> cosy life sims on Switch, but last year <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsandisland/starsand-island">a successful Kickstarter campaign</a> amassed over $300,000 for this one, so there's clearly an appetite for more chilled vibes and harvesting on a handheld hybrid near you.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo is bringing its island-based slow-life hit <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - NS2 Edition</a> to Switch 2 in January, so Starsand might want to avoid that <em>particular</em> part of 'early 2026'. (Then again, is there anyone reading this who doesn't already own New Horizons?)</p>
<p>If you're after an overview and the vibes aren't strong enough on their own, our friends over at Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/starsand-island-is-a-cosy-ps5-rpg-straight-out-of-a-studio-ghibli-daydream">recently previewed the game</a>:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193292 @ 1764757537 -->
<blockquote>
<p>"What really sets Starsand Island apart from the likes of, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, for example, is its complex build system.

<p>Following an update for NieR:Automata</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="61e87ca746c94"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61e87ca746c94/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After ongoing requests from players, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> finally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nierautomata-finally-lands-switch-2-compatibility-update">got a compatibility update</a> for the Switch 2 in November. With this game now functioning as it should on Nintendo's new hardware, another Square Enix title has now received a compatibility update.</p>
<p>This time it's for the role-playing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a>, which was originally released on the Switch eShop in 2022. While it might not be the <em>best</em> remaster in Square Enix's library, there are still fans out there who have been wanting to experience this title on the Switch 2 without any problems.</p>
<p>The good news is the issues associated with this game on Nintendo's hybrid system have now apparently been resolved. Since the arrival of the Switch 2, there were some start up issues, and while these didn't appear to be a massive problem for a lot of players, there were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronoCross/comments/1l7dtsz/comment/n0i7402/?share_id=l1E6CBXyyz7XxS7LSjCtZ&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">some graphical glitches reported</a>.</p>
<p>While nothing is specifically mentioned on Nintendo's compatibility search page, as of 2nd December 2025, the game is now "supported" and the "game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch" on the Switch 2. The notes attached to this mention how the "previously identified issues have been resolved with an update".</p>
<figure data-uuid="a2baf6b5624a0"><a title="Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2baf6b5624a0/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a handful of compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>. Apart from NieR, several other titles received compatibility updates including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>. If you haven't already played the Radical Dreamers Edition of Chrono Cross, we said it was the "best and most convenient way" to relive this classic, despite its shortcomings in the remaster department.</p>

There are 23 games on offer, ranging from the Dark Souls-inspired roguelike Tyrant's Realm to AAA shooters like Wolfenstein: The New Order and its sequel, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Fans of lo-fi indie horror games will also want to check out Faith, whil anyone who misses bygone gaming eras will want to check out the retro-inspired RPG 8-Bit Adventures 2--which evokes console-style RPGs of the NES, SNES, and PS1--and the adventure-platformer Lunark, which takes inspiration from classics like Out of this World and Flashback. Check out the full list of options below.</p><p>Like other Build-you-own bundle deal at Fanatical, this deal offers a sliding payscale, with the price per game dropping as you add more to your cart. The deal starts at three games for $9 ($3 per game). At five or more games, you'll pay just $2.80 for each game, and at seven or more, it's just $2.60 per key. You can add all 23 games to your bundle if you like, which will cost $59.80 (a $399.67 value).</p><ul><li>100% Orange Juice - Game of the Year Every Year Edition</li><li>8-Bit Adventures 2</li><li>Aura of Worlds</li><li>Beyond Galaxyland</li><li>Bore Blasters</li><li>Discopup</li><li>Faith</li><li>Heavy Rain &amp; Beyond: 2 Souls Collection</li><li>Kamikaze Lassplanes</li><li>Lunark</li><li>Maze Mice</li><li>Mr. Sun's Hatbox</li><li>Pinball Spire</li><li>Snowman Storm</li><li>Soda Crisis</li><li>South of the Circle</li><li>Sunrise's Order</li><li>Takara Cards</li><li>Tiny Life</li><li>Trackline Express</li><li>Tyrant's Realm</li><li>Wolfenstein: The New Order</li><li>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</li></ul><hr><h2>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4615502"></a><figcaption>Killer Bundle (Winter 2025 Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4615502-03e75a35-056a-4ae6-8339-22bf120ab1db.jpeg"></figure><p>This new <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+23+Steam+Deck-Ready+PC+Games+With+This+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-02+16%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-02+17%3A12%3A56&amp;fnarticle_id=6536656&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-killer-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-bundlefest-dec-2025%2F1100-6536656%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killer Bundle Winter 2025 edition</a> marks Fanatical's 1,500th PC game bundle deal, so appropriately enough, it has a long list of game from a variety of genres to choose from.

Pricing for this bundle starts at five games for $5.75 ($1.15 per game), and the price per key drops as you add more games. Pick 10 or more games and you pay just $1 per key, and at 20 or more games you'll pay just $0.95 for each. There's no limit to how many games you can pick, and if you add all 28 possible titles to your bundle, you'll pay just $26.59--that's a huge markdown from the bundle's full $682.79 value.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718</link>
            <guid>1371088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m one of the many <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreigns-bell-bearing-carion-draconic-tree-sentinel-2000649218"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> players</a> who’s been begging for DLC for months.<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"> Once it was finally revealed</a>, I was a bit disappointed at how small it seemed. Fortunately, three new pieces of information have convinced me that I have been underestimating FromSoftware’s upcoming <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC. According to a new interview, it’ll be harder than the main game, feature a bigger reworking of the map than previously thought, and include the introduction of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s signature poison swamps.</p> <p>Since the summer, it’s felt like the only way to really revitalize <em>Nightreign</em> was by <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">giving players a new map</a>. When <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> was finally announced, publisher Bandai Namco’s description suggested the Limveld sandbox everyone had become accustomed to would be tweaked but left pretty much intact by the new content. According to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">preview at <em>GameSpot</em></a>, Bandai Namco actually undersold their new content. The new Scholar and Undertaker classes aren’t the only big additions. There’s also the Great Hollows, which is technically still a Shifting Earth event, but is also a much more expansive one than players have previously encountered.</p>

 <p>Players will glide into a separate section of the map with its own fields, city ruins, and sprawling mines. There will even be side-quests where players have to visit side-objectives to alleviate a special new curse. The Great Hollows will apparently be much more vertically focused as well, with caves and tunnels and also points higher up that require light platforming. It definitely sounds like a bigger deal than any of the existing Shifting Earth events players usually just spend the last five minutes of a run zooming through.</p>

 <h2>No new map, but the next best thing</h2> <p>Also, there are swamps now. Not just in the Great Hollows, but the whole of Limveld. These new areas will slow movement and build up poison, scarlet rot, frenzy, and other ailments if you stay in them too long. It sounds simple, but <em>Nightreign</em> is all about navigation, time management, and risk assessment. I can already see many runs succeeding or failing based on players getting too greedy or overly cautious when it comes to traversing these new hazards.</p>

 <p>Director Junya Ishizaki told <em>GameSpot</em> he’s aware of the poison swamp meme, and while there’s no strict rule about every FromSoftware game needing a swamp, it just “always seems to be [that before you realize] someone’s come up with the idea, it’s already sort of in there, and it’s just sort of taken a life of its own.”</p>

 <p>All of these new elements, including new field bosses and some re-worked points of interest, seem aimed at giving seasoned Nightfarers the feeling of playing the game for the first time again, back when they were utterly confused by its mechanics and constantly getting punished for it. This is exactly what fans have been waiting for.</p>

 <h2>Hard enough to feel like you’re playing <em>Nightreign</em> for the first time again</h2> <p>“Obviously, we don’t want it to be so hard that new players can’t get into it, but I think the original idea is that when the game initially had come out, there were even players who are veterans of some of the other games trying to figure out the new systems, trying to figure out how the game works,” Ishizaki said. “I think [we want our] ideas when we’re working on the DLC content to be a reflection of that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out. [The Forsaken Hollows is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <p>I hope he’s lying and players get absolutely wrecked.

<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, boasting hundreds of thousands of active players. It’s a game centered around <strong>loot</strong>, and sometimes, you might need help securing that loot. That’s where Battlestate Games comes in, regularly publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that you can use to get free items.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve collated all the active Escape from Tarkov codes that you can redeem right now, either in the launcher or via the website. Read on to pick up the free items in Tarkov that you know you want.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-escape-from-tarkov-codes">All Active Escape from Tarkov Codes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has a habit of publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that expire quite quickly, with some only being available for 24 hours. With that in mind, I’ve written the most recent Tarkov codes that are working, and the ones that <strong>might work</strong> and are still worth a try.</p>

The patch notes for Burning Springs also highlight new Bounty features, more wildlife, and the introduction of The Ghoul character from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGPRrcnJ5Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9bGPRrcnJ5Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Although Fallout 76's main setting is the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Appalachia, players can now explore a brand-new bordering area with a setting in rural Ohio. Burning Springs is described as a region of southeastern Ohio affected by nuclear destruction and environmental poisoning from a chemical plant. This map expansion offers players a new questline that features a Super Mutant known as the Rust King.</p><p dir="ltr">Highway Town is a main point-of-interest for the new region, and it serves as a social hub for some of the game's new characters. A notable location to visit is the town's Last Resort saloon, which is where players can meet Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul, from the TV series.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features for the Burning Springs update is Bounty Hunting events. Players can collect "Grunt Hunt" bounties while in town, and these mark mutated targets to take down. There are also more challenging "Head Hunt" bounties, and these contracts offer unique rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Burning Springs adds new wildlife to the game. Players can add a new creature, the Radhog, as a Camp pet. The water sources in the region introduce new fish types to fish out and collect as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there are new Legendary mods, more public events, new items to craft, and other content available with the Burning Springs update.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the December 2 Burning Springs update can be found below, <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2tpInvSHR0w7C8GXqEEbrz/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Bethesda Studios</a>.</p><h2>Fallout 76: Burning Springs Release Notes</h2><h3>Update Highlights</h3><ul><li>Bounty Hunting – Grab your duster, cowboy hat, and your favorite weapon because it’s time for some Bounty Hunting!</li><li>Explore Burning Springs – Cross Point Pleasant Bridge to enter a new land of rust and blood.

It’s time for you to travel westward towards Burning Springs. Taking place in rural Ohio, this is our largest map expansion to Fallout 76 yet!</p><p>Become one of the meanest Bounty Hunters around, as the Burning Springs update introduces Bounty Hunting to your Fallout 76 experience. A major new piece of content here to give you the opportunity to find and eliminate some of the area’s largest threats.</p><p>We’re extremely excited to share that The Ghoul from the Fallout TV Show on Amazon Prime will be joining us in Burning Springs! Voiced by Walton Goggins himself, The Ghoul will be your guide in all things Bounty Hunting.</p><p>The main questline for Burning Springs is just the start of your story in this new region. Planned as the beginning chapter for a story that spans multiple updates, this quest works as an introduction to characters that you’ll end up spending more time with down the line.</p><p>With a new questline for you to complete, two new public events, the introduction of Bounty Hunting, plus a load of additional content (including new fish and a local legend to catch), Burning Springs is our largest update since Wastelanders back in 2020.</p><h3>Welcome to Ohio</h3><p>Burning Springs, a region of southeastern Ohio rocked not only by the nuclear destruction of the bombs dropping, but also the environmental poisoning from the local Abraxodyne Chemical plant. The area is now a desolate and barren wasteland with poisonous water, and a dust storm coating everything in a toxin known as Rust.</p><p>Who would ever want to call this land home? The Rust King is who would.</p><p>A Super Mutant with just as much brains as brawn, The Rust king is the unrelenting and unforgiving ruler of Burning Springs. He has twisted the land into his cruel kingdom, where the only rule is "might makes right."</p><p>Players will cross paths with this monstrous monarch during the new questline. He will task the player with proving their worth and braving the wilds of his wasteland.</p><p>While barren, Burning Springs still holds pockets of life. Highway Town serves as a pit stop for the last of humanity. Built on a section of elevated highway, players will be able to rest and resupply here.</p><p>Highway Town serves as the region's new social hub and a last resort for survivors-- speaking of which, The Last Resort saloon at the end of town also serves up Bounty Hunt contracts.</p><p>Once you unlock the location, you'll be able to fast travel directly to the saloon for maximum Bounty Hunt efficiency!</p><p>You can wander into Burning Springs by crossing the bridge in Point Pleasant. The questline can be started by tuning into the Ohio Distress Signal once they've reached level 30."</p><h3>Bounty Hunting</h3><p>Mosey down to the Last Resort saloon in Highway Town if you're looking to put your gun to work. The Ghoul has set up shop there, providing piles of bounties to plunder.</p><p>To start a Grunt Hunt, just pick up one of the posters off the table. There's plenty to go around, so you can repeat this activity to your heart's content.</p><p>Each time you start a Grunt Hunt, a random location in Burning Springs will be chosen, and a mutation will be applied to your target. Watch out, though, because these mutations are contagious: enemies near your target will also benefit from the effects of the mutation!</p><p>Plan accordingly to take out your target without getting overwhelmed. Adjust your build to counteract their mutation or just go for the classic stealth approach.</p><p>If you're lucky, a Grunt Hunt target might drop a premium Bounty Poster. These will allow you to start a Head Hunt-- an extra challenging bounty hunt in the form of a public event! (Note: these are granted through the Quest Rewards and not found on the body itself.)</p><p>Just place your poster on the bounty board outside of the saloon to send the word wide. All players on the server will be alerted to show up to your aid when you do. Only one Head Hunt can be active at a time, though, so be sure to join in any actives ones before trying to start your own.</p><p>There's dozens of unique Head Hunt targets across a handful of locations. Each has a unique loadout and posse protecting them-- some with pretty wild and weird skills, too!</p><p>If you've got an itchy trigger finger, and caps to spare, The Ghoul would be more than happy to part with a premium poster… for the right price.</p><p>Players will be able to track which Head Hunts they've completed from their Challenges and earn a variety of unique rewards for doing so.</p><p>Speaking of loot, Bounty Hunting is primed to be the premiere path for Legendary Item hunters. Grunt Hunt targets will initially appear as 1-star Legendary enemies. As you complete more, they will eventually make their way toward 2 and 3-star!</p><p>Head Hunt targets will always appear as 3-star legendaries and are flanked by a pair of 2-star posse members.</p><p>But, most importantly, Head Hunts have a chance to drop items with NEW 1-, 2-, and 3-star Legendary effects. Some of these will offer special bonuses for Ghoul or human players…</p><h4>New Legendary Mods</h4><p>As mentioned above, you’ll be able to earn items containing new and exclusive-to-Bounty-Hunting Legendary Mods.</p><ul><li>New 1-Star * Mods</li><li>Feral (Melee Weapon) - Kills make you more feral.</li><li>Sniper's (Ranged Weapon) – Gain 120% bonus damage to weak-points while aiming down sights.</li><li>Adrenal (Weapon) - +10% Damage per kill while on a kill streak.</li><li>Adrenal (Armor) - +10% Damage resistance while on a kill streak.</li><li>Lucid (Weapon) - Increase damage up to 40% based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>Lucid (Armor ) - Increase damage up to 6% resistance based on how full your feral sanity meter is.</li><li>New 2-Star** Mods</li><li>Pick Pocketer's (Melee Weapon) - Kills have a 50% chance to award a small amount of caps.</li><li>Pain Killer (Armor) - Gain HP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 HP per second)</li><li>Rushing (Armor) - Gain AP Regen based on your kill streak (up to 3 AP per second)</li><li>Elementalist's (Armor) - +5 All Resistances (up to +25)</li><li>Fierce (Armor only, not Power Armor) - Fortify limb resistance while on a skill streak (up to 10%, max 50%)</li><li>New 3-Star*** Mods</li><li>Glowing (Weapon) - Kills grant a small amount of Rads.</li><li>Healthy (Armor) - Max HP increased by 20 (up to 100)</li><li>Reflex (Armor) - 2% Evade (up to 10)</li><li>Active (Armor) - Max AP is increased by +20 (up to 100)</li><li>Barbarian (Melee) - +1 STR per kill while on a kill streak.</li></ul><h3>New Public Events</h3><p>Gearin’ Up</p><p>Have you ever wanted to help a Deathclaw prepare for its debut in an Arena deathmatch? Now’s your chance!</p><p>The Rust King requires a new combatant. Your job is to head over to the Junkyard and help The Beastmaster gather the scrap metal needed to armor up her latest tamed Deathclaw.</p><p>During this public event, you'll fight alongside your Deathclaw-in-training against the wastelands wildest foes. Just be sure to keep the beast alive! It can't die a glorious death in the arena if doesn't survive the junkyard first…</p><p>Remember: you can heal friendly NPCs using the Medic's Legendary Mod. Don't have one? Well luckily a new unique named weapon, the Stimpike, comes with this pre-installed! You'll have a chance to earn it-- alongside many other rewards-- by completing this event.</p><p>Sinkhole Solutions</p><p>Fires rage beneath the surface of Burning Springs and natural gas deposits occasionally breach the surface near places where the ground has broken.</p><p>Willow, a resident of Highway Town, needs your help culling Radscorpions and Stingwings that have gathered around a highly volatile sinkhole. These creatures are causing issues for the residents of Highway Town so you’ll need to head over to the aptly named Scorpion Lake to activate a “stomper” device to draw them out of their dens.</p><p>Your objective will be to destroy their dens, all while dodging pillars of fire and navigating a blinding sandstorm.</p><p>Also, stick around to the end to learn why Radscorpions aren't an apex predator…</p><h3>Additional Content</h3><p>More Fish</p><p>Assuming you can even find them, the watering holes around Burning Springs are poisonous and irradiated, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t new fish to catch. Explore this new zone and find new fish (including a Local Legend) to add to your collections.</p><p>Side Quest: Dirty Laundry</p><p>Keep a sharp eye out for mysterious Abraxodyne intel briefcases hidden all over Burning Springs. Return them to Bodhi in the city of Athens to take part in the Dirty Laundry side quest.</p><p>Unlike other collectibles, these brief cases appear in specific locations, once per player. You'll have to search every nook and cranny to find all 150.</p><p>(Schoolyard rumors say there's a 151st one hidden under a red truck, but we're pretty sure that's made-up.)</p><p>As you turn these cases in, you'll help Bodhi unravel the mystery of his missing daughter-- and earn unique Abraxodyne-themed rewards along the way.</p><p>You'll earn a unique Legendary weapon for completing the quest-- which only requires finding about half of the total cases-- but you'll get an even more powered-up version if you find every last one.</p><h3>Season 23: Blood X Rust</h3><p>Season 23: Blood X Rust is here to inspire you to unleash your inner raider spirit.</p><h3>Closing Milepost Zero</h3><p>The bandits roaming Skyline Valley looking for caravans to rob have proved themselves to be dastardly threats to the Blue Ridge Caravan Company. Scaring poor brahmin into going off track, leaving deliveries incomplete.</p><p>For now, Milepost Zero will be closing shop and moving their wares to other vendors across Highway Town. Awaiting a time in the future when things might be a bit safer for their operations.</p><p>The rewards from Milepost Zero are now spread across the Wasteland:</p><ul><li>Plans for the V63 Laser Carbin and mods have been moved to the Weapon Vendor Splint in Highway Town.</li><li>Mac in Highway Town will sell the following items:</li><li>Rolled Persian Rug</li><li>Persian Wall Rug</li><li>Makeshift Wine Rack</li><li>Noren Curtains</li><li>Park Ranger Supply Box</li><li>Persian Rug</li><li>Stargazer’s Telescope</li><li>Lightning Battery Lamp</li><li>Noren Awing</li><li>Snow Globes from the Milepost Zero vendors will now be sold by Windy in Highway Town (she is a Gold Bullion vendor).</li><li>Spooky Scorched will reward the Lederhosen Outfit &amp; Hat, Redcoat Outfit *Hat, and the Vault Girl/Vault Boy backpacks.</li><li>Holiday Scorched will reward all the Skyline Valley specific Snow Globes.</li></ul><p>All characters who completed the “A Bump In the Road” Caravan intro quest will receive the title “Caravan Investor” (immediately upon logging in).</p><p>We will also be granting a pennant that can be used account wide (any character on the account will have access to this pennant) and characters that have completed the quest will also receive 2K Gold Bullion. The Pennant will be granted during the first week of Burning Spring’s release while players should expect to see the 2K Gold Bullion upon logging into characters who have completed then quest.</p><p>We believe that Bounty Hunting delivers on the same promise of on-demand content, with Legendary enemies, and great rewards in a more succinct and satisfying way. We love the Skyline Valley region and have some fun things planned.</p><h3>New C.A.M.P. Pet - Radhog</h3><p>One of the new creatures you’ll find in Burning Springs is the Radhog. They’re tough and fiercely protective of their young, so if you get too close expect to be attacked.</p><p>What would happen if you brought one to your C.A.M.P.? You would probably have the most adorably disgusting pet this side of the Ohio River!</p><p>After purchasing the Radhog C.A.M.P. Pet from the Atomic Shop, the radhog bed item can be found in the “Dwellers” section of the Workshop menu and its Nose Ring is in the “Pet Clothing” section of the Armor Workbench.</p><h3>New Seasonal Weapon – Dom Pedro</h3><p>A new weapon is entering the fray.</p><p>The Dom Pedro is a Hand Cannon that can fire .50 rounds or be swapped to .308. It has an explosive effect and can pierce enemies too. Really sending a message to anyone foolish enough to stand in your way.</p><h3>Emote Wheel</h3><p>Whether you’re hitting your favorite emote at the wandering traveler passing by in the hulking Power Armor skin or trying to convince a level 30 Vault Dweller to pick up the loot you just dropped for them, emoting is core to the Appalachian way of living.</p><p>In the Burning Springs update we’re reorganizing emotes so that more emotes can be equipped at once.</p><p>We’re doing this by:</p><ul><li>introducing 2 new categories, “Social” and “Performance”</li><li>removing the “Follow Me” and “Team Up” categories and placing most of their emotes into “Help” and “Social”</li><li>reorganizing the emotes in the “Misc” so that more of them live in more appropriate categories like “Performance” and “Taunt”.</li></ul><p>With the work done here, you can now equip all your favorite emotes at once with little to no need to go into the Atomic Shop to swap them in and out.</p><h3>Gleaming Depths</h3><p>Almost a year after its introduction, Gleaming Depths has proved to be an excellent place for players looking for an endgame challenge to push themselves and their builds to the limit.</p><p>We’re introducing a new weekly challenge for Gleaming Depths that can be completed by working through all stages of the raid. Your reward for doing so will be a 4-Star Legendary cache that contains a 4-Star Armor, Power Armor, Melee Weapon, and a Ranged Weapon.</p><p>To go along with this new weekly challenge, we’re also redistributing the raid rewards so that the farther you progress in Gleaming Depths the more enticing the rewards will be. We know this may cause some disruption to your local EN06 farming group (and you can still farm him for XP), but it was never our intention to have one phase of the raiding experience be the source of some of the most coveted rewards in the game.</p><p>In this update we’re also fixing numerous bugs and introducing quality-of-life improvements to make the raiding experience smoother for everyone.</p><hr><h3>Combat</h3><p>Combat in Appalachia has experienced a lot of changes since the Skyline Valley update was released last year. For Burning Springs we’re slowing things down to see how it all settles.</p><p>We are making a few more adjustments to V.A.T.S. to address the feedback we’ve received after the Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp update. All in all, you should experience far less instance of V.A.T.S. chance to hit fluctuations and targeting issues.</p><ul><li>Fixed cryo slow being applied to players who aren't in PvP.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Hack and Slash could damage players outside of PvP.</li></ul><h3>C.A.M.P.</h3><ul><li>All items from the Mischief Night rewards now appear in the Build menu.</li><li>Build budgets of various items have been adjusted.</li><li>Fixed an issue which could cause the Store/Scrap button to not work when pressed by the player.</li><li>Straw Goat decoration plans are now known by default for all players.</li><li>Fixed issue where C.A.M.P.
