            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grit-and-valor-1949-is-strategy-gamers-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take the positional tactics of&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach, </em>the weapon triangle system of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>, and some roguelite elements for good measure, and you'll find that the concoction brewed from this unlikely combination makes for an absolute banger -- that game is&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949.</em></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of stumbling upon&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949&nbsp;</em>by happenstance during The Mix in LA, and as a lover of all things strategy and tactics, I am hooked.</p>

<p>The concept for&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949&nbsp;</em>is simple enough, but its complexity soon becomes apparent as you fight through alternate history Europe -- in a world where World War II never ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fights take place on charming, diorama-like battlefields and your squad of mechs are dropped into position. One of these mechs is technically your base that must be protected as you fight waves of enemies, dropping every 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>It's up to you to stop these waves of enemy soldiers and mechs, and I soon got addicted to the strategic element of positioning my units to properly counter the attacks.</p>

<p>There's a weapon triangle of sorts, akin to&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem</em>. Your units have certain damage types -- like one that spews fire -- and that counters enemies using explosives. Explosive units counter ballistic-using mechs, so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The layer of strategy deepens when you throw in pilot abilities. Pilots operate these mechs, and each operator comes with their own ability. You can mix and match the pilot and mech, so many combinations are possible and adds so much more depth.</p>
<p>Optional objectives in maps grant a permanent currency that can be used for upgrades that permeate throughout your runs, so failure does not mean total defeat. You can go back to base, upgrade your metal hulks and their abilities, and go at it again.</p>

<p>Outside of that, you'll unlock temporary upgrades exclusive to your current run, so after each victory, you're granted a reward that should aid in your liberation of&nbsp;Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll fight across Europe in&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949</em>, so there are individual zones with their own unique identity. Scandinavia, for instance, introduces elevation, so now players will have to fight for a height advantage on top of tackling waves of enemy units.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything about&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949</em>&nbsp;is hitting the right notes. TechRaptor Editor-in-Chief Andrew Otton says this has potential to be big among <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/strategy?page=0,4">strategy</a> and tactics gamers, and as I fall into that demographic -- I wholeheartedly agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer has confirmed that more Xbox games will be available on other platforms in the future.</p>



<p>It’s been a wild past few months for Xbox, with rumors of its first-party games coming to other platforms. First, rumors started to swirl that one, then two, and eventually, all of Xbox’s first-party games would be coming to other platforms. After weeks of rumors seemingly increasing the scope of this change in strategy, Xbox finally addressed the rumors in a business podcast. After confirming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-announces-four-xbox-games-coming-to-other-consoles-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four games would jump ship to other platforms</a>, Phil Spencer said this was “not a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy.” But just a few months later, that strategy has seemingly been flipped on its head.</p>



<p>During a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto&amp;ab_channel=IGN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First interview</a>, Spencer again addressed the neverending rumors, but with a completely different answer from the first time. “You are going to see more of our games on more platforms, and we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we’re building, and we see that from players, and the players love to be able to play,” Spencer said.</p>



<p>The answer was a complete 180 from the one from a few months back, and while company plans always change, Xbox’s strategy is still unclear in the grand scheme of things. Apparently, all of these decisions are part of Xbox’s “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Latitude</a>,” which, as far as the most recent rumors go, consists of games being “considered” for rival platforms. So, basically, Project Latitude doesn’t mean much to anyone until the green light has been given on said games, including the players and the developers behind the games.</p>



<div><p>This is where we’re at with the confusion around Xbox and the rumors surrounding it. It’s quite blatantly obvious that some people at Xbox are divided, too, and have resorted to feeding (often inaccurate or incomplete) information to journalists and content creators to stir the pot. It’s clear that Xbox has at least one unhappy bunny in the know of these decisions, and Xbox leadership needs to get a firm grip on what it wants to do.</p><p>Where this lands for Xbox is anyone’s guess. Personally, I don’t really care. But this first-party to other platforms sega needs to end with direct answers. What games will be available on other platforms? When will they be coming? And how much will they cost?</p><p>Fin.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-ign-live-interview-on-the-health-of-xbox-handhelds-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hot on the heels of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, CEO Phil Spencer sat down with IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey at IGN Live 2024 to run through what some have called the best video game showcase in years.</p><p>The reveal included fresh looks at upcoming big hitters in Xbox’s now enormous arsenal of franchises following its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Xbox mainstays Gears of War, Fable, and Perfect Dark were joined by the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Diablo... all these huge series got their time to shine. It was a blistering showcase focused squarely on the games, and based on initial feedback online, the games looked good.</p><p>But Microsoft's showcase has hit the headlines during one of the most troubling times for Xbox in recent memory. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">Microsoft announced 1,900 staff would lose their jobs across its gaming business</a>, and then came <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the shock closure of Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a> as part of devastating cuts at Bethesda. Is any studio, regardless of critical or commercial acclaim, safe?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft faces <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">difficult questions about the future of Xbox consoles</a>, which have seen sales plummet year-on-year, as well as an apparent struggle to grow subscription service Game Pass. Microsoft is bringing even more of its games to rival platforms with the announcement that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Doom: The Dark Ages will launch on PlayStation 5</a> alongside Xbox Series X and S and PC. When it comes to Xbox, the times certainly are changing.</p><p>During our interview, Spencer discussed all this and more. Read on for the complete IGN Live interview with Phil Spencer.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I think you just had the best showcase you've ever had. I said it before you got here.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Thank you, Ryan.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> It really was fantastic. Now I know you plan these things months and months in advance. For anybody that doesn't know, planning for this starts like the beginning of the year. So I'm curious, at what point do you, with this one this year, do you get a feeling that, oh, this one's looking pretty good?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Honestly, until our fans, the customers, you guys give us the feedback… Aaron Greenberg and I were talking about this two weeks ago. The thing that probably hit me the most was obviously just the passion of the teams of putting their amazing work on stage and seeing so many teams do great work. But it was, I'd say two months ago, when I just looked at the scale of the franchises, how much work the teams were doing to show up in the way they did and the partners that we had in the show. I was in awe of the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> There's a couple games I want to ask you about specifically before we'll talk about some other stuff too. For me, of all the great stuff from today, stole the show for me was something I wasn't expecting to see today again, which was Perfect Dark.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I knew you were going to say that! </p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Perfect Dark, a first-person spy espionage, some parkour, a little Mirror's Edge in there, which I love. </p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> All playable, all in-game.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And that game's been cooking for a long time.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It has. Our partners at Crystal [Dynamics] have been doing amazing work there.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> So what has it been like for you to follow the very long trajectory of that game from, that started with Darrell Gallagher starting a studio [The Initiative].</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Just down the street.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And now we're finally here. So how has it been getting to this point with Perfect Dark?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> In parallel, building a studio while you're building a game, and something that Perfect Dark back to N64 and obviously us with PDZ on 360, like there's just such anticipation for that game, and I really appreciate everybody's patience because we've been talking about this for a long time. And my team can verify this - when I saw it, I said, this is the one that Ryan's going to love. Because we know his love for spy and I said, this is the one. I’m just so proud of the team and it really just came together so well.</p><p>A cool little story: Darrell had our other studio heads down at the studio just yesterday and walked through that same section in-game to show them, this is a game being played. And I love seeing our community of creators coming together that way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> The one more thing, which we were all hoping for and got was a new Gears of War game, but it wasn't Gear 6!</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It was not!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You have a visibility into everything, but I'm curious, when you're in a meeting with, maybe it's Matt Booty, maybe it's Alan Hartman, but The Coalition folks, but when you learn they've gone down the E-Day road, the prequel road rather than Gears 6, what was your reaction when you found out that that was going to be the next direction for Gears of War?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well you know this, we've had some changes in leadership at the studio. Rod [Fergusson], who was there, is now leading Diablo for us. So I actually thought - a Diablo game I'm playing a ton of - I thought it was a nice opportunity for that team to establish their Gears. Following on Gears 5 just because of the numerical thing, I think it would just… this was an opportunity for them to take it back to an origin story that has a lot of real depth to it in terms of Emergence Day and tell that story through The Coalition as it is today. I thought, what a great opportunity. I was excited.</p><p>And then you probably saw, I know you heard it, the Mad World tune, for those of us who remember the 360 commercial, how iconic was that? So when they went back and sourced that and brought that through the piece, I think it just showed that they stayed true to what Gears is, but tell a new story, a new arc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Now you're wearing a very cool Xbox Pride shirt today, but a year ago at the Xbox Showcase, you freaked out people like me by wearing a Hexen shirt, which is a game that I have very near and dear to my heart. You had just acquired Hexen. You own that as a part of many other things. But then today I see the reveal for Doom: The Dark Ages, and I go, wait a second…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> How awesome was that?</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> … are you secretly making a Hexen game in the Doom universe? I know you and I share the love for this.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah. No, I would like to say I'm actually smart enough to predict anything like that. I wasn't. But definitely if you look at Doom: The Dark Ages, and thanks to Marty [Stratton] and the team they let me introduce that. I was going through all my old-school stories, for those as old as me who remember it's Doom 1 on a floppy. My only PC that could run it was my PC at Microsoft. So I would sneak in at night, put it in so I could play. So the opportunity to stand there and get to announce a Doom, and then Doom: The Dark Ages, which definitely has some Hexen in it, and I just thought, Hugo [Martin] and the team, fantastic work. I'm so proud.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Now I can't help but bring up something that's been a topic of conversation a lot recently, which is that Doom: The Dark Ages is also going to ship on PS5, something that you've done with some other games. So from a business level, can you walk me through… you paid $7.5 billion to acquire Bethesda / ZeniMax. So what's the calculus? What's the process there for deciding, okay, new Doom, let's keep it multi-platform as it has been rather than just put it on Xbox? So what's the thought process there?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well, on Doom, it's definitely one of those franchises that has a history on so many devices. I think they have Doom running on a lawnmower somewhere. It's a franchise that I think everybody deserves to play. And to be honest, I was in a meeting with Marty and the team a couple of years ago and I asked Marty what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to ship it on all platforms. I said, let's go do that. It was as simple as that.</p><p>Now I want to bring it back though, because I get a lot of questions about, hey, if I'm an Xbox owner, what does it mean? And what I want to say - and I thought it showed up so well in the show today - you saw an amazing collection of games that are coming to Xbox. They're going into Game Pass day one, and Game Pass showed up so well. If you buy the game on our console, you get to play it on PC. So the cross-entitlement stuff is all there.</p><p>And we're focused on future hardware with forward compatibility. Our commitment to our Xbox customers is you're going to get the opportunity to buy or subscribe to the game. We're going to support the game on other screens, and you are going to see more of our games on more platforms. And we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we're building. And we see that from players and the players love to be able to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You haven’t really commented publicly much in the last couple months, so I wanted to ask you about the studio closures and Tango Gameworks and some of the thoughts behind the decision-making there. I mean, you had a critical darling in Hi-Fi Rush. You had folks like Aaron Greenberg saying it checked all these boxes for us and did all the right things here. So walk me through the decision of why really Tango specifically, not to disrespect the other studios that were closed, but that was the one that really seemed to kind of stick in the community's craw a bit. I'm hoping here that you can take the opportunity to address that closure and some of the recent changes in Xbox.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah, the closure of any team is hard, obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team. And I try to spend all of my focus, as you said, I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is a time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR, it's about those teams.</p><p>In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow. And that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make. We will continue to go forward, we will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business that we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> On the Activision Blizzard saga…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> You call it a saga?</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Well, just from covering it and watching it it felt like it put five years on my life to somebody that covers Xbox. I can't imagine how it was for you. But as that came to a close and you started integrating Activision Blizzard King into Xbox Studios, has that changed the way that you think about running the business at all? Because the organization just got quite a bit larger almost overnight in a sense.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> No. I mean we're still, and I hope we showed this today, we're going to be about building great games for people to play, about giving them choice on Xbox to go play. We've got a broader library of games. The thing I'm starting to see, which I really love, is the organic collaboration between our teams that are coming out and trying to build that community of creators that, I mean, you and I will go back to the time of Xbox where we basically had four games: Fable, Forza, Gears, Halo. And we would just literally, every four years I would have to come to E3 and I'd somehow try to make those four games seem different every year for the community.</p><p>And now what we have in gaming is just an amazing collection of teams and franchises that are doing great work. I feel an added responsibility as somebody who loves this industry for the franchises that show up on our stage. But I still think in the end it's about putting amazing games out. I'm really proud of the work that Ninja Theory did with Hellblade and the response to that. And we have an amazing internal team now that's focused on us doing a bunch of Unreal games as an example. And then you see things like South of Midnight, which might've been my game of the show, I thought it looked so good, you got Perfect Dark, you have Gears.</p><p>So for us, as the organization gets bigger, I think it's just more important that we can take bets together and try to do innovative, creative things, and that will continue to drive us.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I'm really proud of the work that Ninja Theory did with Hellblade and the response to that.</p></div><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Phil, you and I in the past have talked a lot about the past of Xbox because there's a lot of great memories. But the present, as we saw today on the Xbox Game Showcase is great. The future looks super promising here, and the Xbox business has changed dramatically.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It has.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And so when you make an almost $70 billion acquisition, do you start hearing from your bosses more? Or are they still staying out of your way and letting you run the business? Because that's not an insignificant amount of money to spend on growing the business.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It's definitely not an insignificant amount of money! No. The support we get from the company, and my boss is the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella. Hey, Satya. We are given a ton of leeway to go and run and grow our business. But I'll say the thing that we challenge ourselves to do is to try to do new things. </p><p>If I go back eight years ago, we said, hey, we're going to go ship all of our games on PC and console, and if you buy one on one, you get it on the other. And I got some reaction from people of, this is the worst decision ever. This is going to be the end of Xbox. We announced Game Pass and we started doing Game Pass, and I know some people looked at that and said, oh, you're going to teach people that games are free and you're going to undermine the value in games.</p><p>And what I can say sitting here today from our decisions on cloud, on Game Pass, on console, right now we have more Xbox console users than we've ever had in the history of Xbox. And even when I look at things like the impact of Game Pass, because I watch that and I love Game Pass, how it showed up in the show today I think was fantastic. But we also want people to be able to buy games. So I go back and I look and I say, okay, over the last five years, what's happened to game sales on our platform? We're up double digits every year over the last five years on game sales, on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Doing a $70 billion acquisition will push us to try to do more. It'll push us on cloud, it'll push us to go find customers in new places, continue to think about access to amazing games, enabling creators to do great work. But I actually think for the team, that's just a self-motivation that the team has and it's fun to be a part of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Black Ops 6 day one Game Pass.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Some people said I wouldn't do that.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Most people in this room have probably been used to spending 60, 70 bucks on it every year. Now if they're already subscribing to Game Pass they’re good to go.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> But it's a choice. We didn't say to anybody, you have to subscribe to play. If you want to buy Black Ops, great. It's great for us, it's great for the developer. If you want to subscribe, it's also great. I want to give you the choice on how you play your games and who you play with and not try to do slimy platform things to force you to do what I want you to do. Give the players choice and what they want to do and who they play with.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/gettyimages-1259162567-1717983863325.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Phil Spencer: Photo by Loren Elliott/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> So the Activision Blizzard thing, we watched it play out in courtrooms.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> With my tie on!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I'm curious, what was the biggest unexpected challenge for you and the team at Xbox during the course of that?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> For the management team like Sarah Bond, Lori Wright, Linda Norman, who's our lead lawyer at Xbox, we all had our same job of running Xbox and doing the things that we needed to go do. Matt Booty. But then we actually added this second job in the time of having to work through regulatory.</p><p>It's my fault as the head of the business, I didn't really internalize that in the beginning of what a drain that would be on the team. And I think we saw that. I think we saw it in our execution on a couple things that we were doing multiple things at that time that we hadn't planned for. And I'll say it's really nice to be post the acquisition working with those amazing teams. I mean, how they showed up in our show today… fantastic. I just thought it was great. I mean, we had World of Warcraft in an Xbox show. It's just crazy.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Was there ever a point in the process, because it really, between the CMA and the FTC and all these places, was there ever a point where you thought, oh, this might not happen, this might get rejected?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well, we always have to plan for all contingencies. We consider everything. You have to in running the business. But we felt like we were on the side of right, meaning we weren't doing this so we could pull Call of Duty from PlayStation players. It was never in our plan. I mean, I think my whole inbox leaked on the internet, so if anybody wanted to find that that was the plan, you would find it somewhere and it wasn't there.</p><p>So we believed we were in the right on getting this deal done, so we stayed convicted. But there were dark days, like when the CMA came out and said, no, this isn't going to go through. And the drag on the teams, the teams at Activision, Blizzard and King, they're dealing with this uncertainty. So it's so nice to have it behind us, and now we can just focus on building great games together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We love that we have so many PC players, more than we've ever had. Our console's doing so well.</p></div><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> On that topic, we talk about all these huge changes to not just the industry, but again, specifically your business, the Xbox business over the last five or so years. What is today as we sit here now, what's the thesis statement? What's the modus operandi for Xbox today, and how has it changed over the last five years?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah, I see some of the feedback that our messaging from some people that maybe our messaging hasn't been consistent, and I always hear the feedback and I take it. Feedback is great. I will say from early on, we would say, when everybody plays, we all win. How do we get in a place where everybody can play video games? And we've made different progress on PC. Now PC is a huge business for us. We love that we have so many PC players, more than we've ever had. Our console's doing so well.</p><p>But I think if you sit back and you try to frame this industry through the lens of the tradition of who sold a console today, and that's the only solution to making gaming better, I think Xbox is doing something different than that. We love our consoles, we love our PC players, but really it's about creators and players and amazing games coming to them.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> It has, admittedly, for all of us, creators, players, it has been a weird generation because it started weird in this pandemic. And I'm curious, would you do anything differently in this Xbox Series generation if you could go back and tell yourself?</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I'm not really a regrets guy. There's a hundred decisions I made that, yeah, in hindsight, maybe I would make it different with all the data. But you got to just bet. You got to bet on yourself and bet on the teams, have a vision of what you're trying to do. When you get punched in the face, you get back up and you try to go do things. So I'm not really one who looks back and say, I wish I would've done this or that. If you're in a position like this, with the team that we have, you just have to believe and you have to keep pushing forward and take the feedback from amazing customers that talk to us every day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Has the calculus changed? You spoke to Game Pass and how much of the value proposition has increased after today even. But has the calculus changed on how much Game Pass subscriptions are valued at Microsoft versus direct sales? Because when Game Pass started, it was, wow, this sounds really cool, and you've pledged to put every first-party release in there. And at the beginning there weren't a lot of those, but now you're almost like you had a whole show full of them. So what is that metric for success? How does Game Pass influence the success of the business?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> The thing I look at every morning is how many people played on our platforms and how long did they play? If they played through the subscription or they paid for their games, or they're playing a free-to-play game, honestly, that's not the most important thing.</p><p>So Game Pass, I love it. The thing I really love about Game Pass in our show today, a game like Mixtape. Nathan Vella [co-head of Annapurna Interactive] and I can have a conversation and say, with a team that's been in Game Pass before, when you think about the studio behind it, they had great success, now we're going to do a second game. Or Winter Burrow, another just awesome game that we can go invest in.</p><p>And Game Pass gives us an ability... you can go invest in Call of Dutys and Diablos all day, and we love that, but you also get to invest in new things that come out, and we just think that's a really important part of the equation.</p><p>Game Pass is up double digits. PC is growing really well, cloud's growing really well. But if somebody decides they want to buy their games and build their library, peace. There’s no, we need to turn everybody into this or that. We just want people to play.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Events</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I want to talk about Fallout for a second. So you guys are currently having an awesome pop culture moment. But I can't help think about that a year or two ago I was sitting with Todd Howard with a camera rolling, and I asked him, well Fallout 5, you want to do that yourself? Or maybe now there's all these Xbox studios, you could maybe have some help with it. And he said, no, that's mine. I’m going to direct that.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Todd likes his things!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> But Fallout, I would argue, is Xbox's biggest cultural moment in quite a while.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Outside of gaming, yeah.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And so after the TV show blows up and there'll be a season two, and I'm sure it'll probably keep going past that, do you talk to Todd about like, you can't stop The Elder Scroll 6 and say go do Fallout 5, but you have all these studios. Do you have a conversation about, well, how can we do a big new Fallout while the iron's really hot here with the TV show?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah. I'll just say that Todd's recognized the success of the television show on his own. He doesn't need me to kind of go and… It is amazing to see how gaming is now playing such a role all up in pop culture. As an old comic nerd, I go back 10 years and it seemed like every Hollywood thing came from the comics. And now you see video games, and this art form that we've loved for so long, whether it's the Mario Movie, Last of Us, Fallout show, you see our creatives in our industry being recognized for the worlds and storytelling that they can go do.</p><p>For us specifically, Fallout's been amazing. And yeah, Todd's looking at the plans on what he's doing. I'm not going to get into it, but I'll say Todd has recognized the success on his own and is thinking through what that means.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I guess while we're on the subject, have you seen The Elder Scroll 6 lately? I know you get to take a look at a lot of stuff.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I'll refrain from comment!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I think we all know what you mean by that! Well ask Todd to, you know… We're waiting here, pal!</p><p>There's one other thing I wanted to ask you about that I thought we actually might hear something about from you - I mean, you had a great show, I'm not complaining - but I thought, well, there's something that's been rumored, that's been talked about. And that is an Xbox handheld. You've been building the business around this mantra of, go where the players are, whether it's on PC…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> So we should have handheld? I think we should have a handheld, too!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You want to say anything about that?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> No, I don't want to say anything! You'll have to have Sarah Bond on, our president of Xbox, who is awesome. But the future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it.</p><p>Today was about the games. We showed some of our gen nine console Series S, Series X, the work that we're doing. But we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring 'em to you.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Hypothetically, if Microsoft did an Xbox gaming handheld PC device, would it be a Steam Deck-like dedicated piece of hardware that I can play offline, or would it be something I would need a wifi connection to stream things from?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I’ll put it this way: I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go - fantastic - my Steam Deck. I think being able to play games locally is really important.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You can read between the lines on that as you will!</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

According to Activision’s support page: “To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes.” An Activision spokesperson subsequently verified the explanation to IGN. Here’s the statement in full:</p><p>“To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While PC gamers have had to maintain a constant internet connection to play Call of Duty campaigns for some years now, Black Ops 6 marks the first time on console.</p><p>Microsoft has signaled that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb">Black Ops 6 will weigh in at an eye-watering 309.85 GB on Xbox Series X and S</a>, although there are questions over exactly how that will be distributed within the COD HQ game launcher, which houses all the current Call of Duty games as well as battle royale Warzone. IGN has asked Activision for clarification.</p><p>The note about texture streaming in Activision’s explanation is also nothing new for Call of Duty, but in this case appears to reference the ability to stream from the cloud in order to keep the game’s install size down, rather than locally from an SSD. Perhaps Black Ops 6’s, or COD HQ’s enormous 309.85 GB install footprint will be mitigated somewhat through the use of this tech. On PC, Activision has said Black Ops 6 requires an SSD with 149 GB of available space at launch (78 GB if COD HQ and Warzone are already installed).</p><p>Meanwhile, Activision has confirmed that Modern Warfare 2 and 3 content will not carry forward into Black Ops 6.

It is a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage that has you chaining together thrown knives and solar plexus punches, headshots and tree-fu.

<p>As you can tell, the game overfloweth with Strange Scaffold flavour: subversive and a little ironic while still paying loving homage to the spent shell casings of yesteryear. The writing is great! There’s an odd poetry to the tutorial. The voiceover talks about how nice the bird I’m following is while I’m working out which side of the mouse does the punching. Soon, I’m introduced to Beast’s most tantalisingly ripe-for-nonsense feature: You can run up trees and perch on branches with a single key press. I tree-hop gracefully through the snowy woods, talking about this lovely bird, and it’s very freeing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the bird gets shot. I’m soon embroiled in a too-old-for-but-still-dangerously-good-at-this shit tale, which comes across a bit like the plot of spy thriller someone whispered rapidly in your ear in the dark corner of a techno club that smells way nicer than it has any right to. Also, it has great air conditioning. The game feels slick without being polished past the point of novelty. </p>
<p>Now,  sometimes, that polish would be welcome. Context commands like the aforementioned branch hop can feel a little stiff and evasive, but everything still comes together well enough to pull off some skull-denting Wickensian combos.</p>
<p>I foresee that people are going to get very good at this game. They’re going to perfect replays that make any cutscene you could imagine look cumbersome and soggy by comparison. They’re going to nibble delicately at its nuances like a tactical lizard at a plate of mealworms. Each short stage grades you on speed and side objectives like ‘throw three knives’, which is a paltry amount of knives in relation to how many knives you will want to throw naturally. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">This one’s out August 15th, 2024</a>, with a demo out now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-could-never-deliver-proper-8k-60-fps-with-hdr-output-but-the-xbox-series-x-could.896625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-never-deliver-8k-xbox-series-x/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite claims that were proudly displayed on the system's box, the PlayStation 5 could never deliver proper 8K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR output due to some technical reasons.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent removal of the 8K sticker from the console's packaging, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0RjcK63tqI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided a rather interesting explanation of how a proper 8K resolution output at 60 frames per second with HDR was never going to be a thing for the console. The system's HDMI output is limited to 32 gigabits per second, which is not enough for 8K resolution at 60 FPS unless some compromises are made, such as at 420 chroma subsampling. Chroma subsampling is used to reduce bandwidth costs by reducing the resolution of specific color channels, a reduction that is not really noticeable at high resolutions. In addition, HDR could never be enabled at 8K resolution, as it required 10 bit per channel, as opposed to the 8 bit per channel offered by the PlayStation 5. Interestingly enough, the Xbox Series X could deliver the 8K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR output, as the HDMI output of the Microsoft system has higher bandwidth, although chroma subsampling would still need to be used.</p>
<p>Ultimately, 8K output support for both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X was never enabled via a firmware update, and it's easy to understand why, as there's no gaming or video content available at 8K resolution, and the adoption of 8K displays is extremely limited at this point. The only reason Sony and Microsoft would have had to enable 8K output support was to let the consoles handle the scaling instead of the TV, but due to memory constraints, they wouldn't have been able to do a better job than TVs.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #166: Summer Games Fest, PS5 '8K' Labelling, AutoSR Microsoft Upscaling!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z0RjcK63tqI?start=3839&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The 8K output resolution support sticker shouldn't also be expected to return with the PlayStation 5 Pro rumored to release later this year. As 8K resolution has lost its marketing value in the past few years, we should expect Sony to focus on other features to entice players to upgrade to its new system.</p>

			<p>Eidos Montreal, the Square Enix-owned studio, is aiding Playground Games on the upcoming Fable reboot, it's been confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during Microsoft's Xbox showcase, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finally received a gorgeous new gameplay trailer for Fable</a>. As most of you will know, the reboot is being developed by Forza Horizon studio Playground Games, but as now confirmed, the British studio is being aided by Deux Ex studio Eidos Montreal. "Playground Games also confirmed its collaboration with Eidos Montreal, who will be supporting the ongoing development of&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, which will be coming to players in 2025", Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-games-showcase-2024-recap-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on the official Xbox Wire yesterday. In addition, the official Eidos Montreal X account <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1799870163191304253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> the following: "<span>We're so excited to be supporting the development of&nbsp;</span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/fable">Fable</a></span><span>! It's been a blast collaborating with the talented team at&nbsp;</span><span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://x.com/WeArePlayground">WeArePlayground&nbsp;</a></span><span>to craft an unforgettable adventure".</span></p>
<p>Back in November 2022 <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-new-ip-fable-support-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we already reported</a> on an article from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, which mentioned that the Deus Ex studio was doing support work on Playground's Fable. This rumor, however, wasn't officially confirmed - until now. Of course, another Square Enix studio - Crystal Dynamics - is aiding on The Initiative's<a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Perfect Dark</a>. As such, Eidos Montreal helping out on Fable does make sense.</p>
<p>Aside from the studio's work on the Deus Ex franchise, Eidos Montreal is known for developing 2014's splendid Thief, 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and the more recent Guardians of the Galaxy. Recent rumors suggest that, aside from aiding Playground on Fable, the studio is currently working on a new Deus Ex installment alongside a brand new IP.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about the Fable reboot (which is slated for a release on PC and Xbox next year), or the new projects from Eidos Montreal come in. For now, stay tuned and discuss what you think about the studio helping out on Fable below.</p>

<p>Avowed release date was unintentionally leaked by Obsidian, with the game slated to release this November.</p>



<p>Yesterday’s showcase had all players wondering, where is the release date for Avowed? Interestingly, the prayers were answered today as Obsidian accidentally posted the release date on their latest blog post for the game. </p>



<p>Spotted by The Verge’s <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1799950958354706555?t=rfJuJefqD990_awwYHSpyw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren</a>, Obsidian stated in a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now-altered blog post</a> that Avowed has been preparing for a “November 12, 2024” release date. The updated post has removed all mentions of a release date for the game.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>Following Warren’s post, Obsidian seemingly scrubbed the mention of the game’s release date from its blog.</p><p>Avowed is an open-world RPG title that was revealed in 2022, and we got to see more about the game during yesterday’s Xbox Game Showcase. Obsidian released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-confirmed-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new gameplay trailer </a>yesterday, showing off the title’s stunning visuals, detailed worlds and intriguing characters, but didn’t give us a release date. We got a glimpse of the combat, too, which included first-person melee and ranged combat with medieval weapons and enchanting spells. You can check out their latest trailer below.&nbsp;</p></div>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykgkdU1NJUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Talking more about the game, in Avowed, you play as an envoy of the Aedyran emperor, and all the excitement is set in Paradis, a city in the center of the Living Lands. This city has also become the spot of conflict between Aedryan forces and the locals. However, that is not all, as Paradis is also home to a mysterious plague of the soul, Dreamscourge. This plague affects the flora, fauna, the people and the land itself, with the worst turning into violent “Dreamthralls”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players will be communicating with three factions during this journey. The first is the Aedryan faction, where the emperor wants you to put an end to the Dreamscourge. The second faction’s leader is Inquisitor Lodwyn, the leader of the Steel Garrote. Lodwyn wishes to eliminate the plague and discipline the “unruly factions.” Lastly, your companion Giatta wants you to embrace the more significant, mysterious force at work. Players must make informed decisions and work ahead with these actions, as every choice they make could be suitable for some factions and bad for others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you think Obsidian will stick to the same release date for Avowed? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the Xbox Game Showcase 2024, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by Ryan McCaffrey on the IGN Live stream.</p>
<p>The executive went through a lot of topics, such as the long-rumored Xbox handheld, which, despite insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointing to the contrary</a>, was once again a no-show. That said, Spencer did not shy from commenting on the possibility, albeit in a vague way:</p>
<p><em>The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome and the work that the team is doing around different form factors and different ways to play is something I'm incredibly excited about. Today was about the games. We showed a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-digital Xbox Series X console</a>. We will have a time to come out and talk more about the platform. But I think we should have a handheld, too.</em></p>
<p>The Xbox handheld is likely being made, then, but it's simply not ready to be shown yet. When asked whether it would be a cloud-only device like the ones released by <a href="https://wccftech.com/logitech-g-cloud-streaming-portable-xbox-game-pass-geforce-now-google-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, Spencer said that would not be the case, as he believes being able to play games locally is 'really important'.</p>
<p>The Xbox executive also chimed on <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> coming to PlayStation 5, confirming that the same choice may be made for other first-party games at some point.</p>
<p><em>On Doom, it's definitely one of those franchises that has a history on so many devices. It's a franchise that I think everybody deserves to play. I was in a meeting with Marty (Stratton from id Software) and the team a couple of years ago, and I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to ship it on all platforms. I said let's go do that. It was as simple as that.</em></p>
<p><em>I get a lot of questions about, hey, if I'm an Xbox owner what does it mean? What I want to say, and I thought it showed up so well in the show today, you saw an amazing collection of games that are coming to Xbox that they're going into Game Pass day one. Game Pass showed up so well. If you buy the game on our console, you get to play it on PC as well with the cross-entitlement stuff. We're also focused on future hardware with forward compatibility. Our commitment to our Xbox customers is you're going to get the opportunity to buy or subscribe to the game. We're going to support the game on other screens and you are going to see more of our games on more platforms and we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we're building.</em></p>
<p>Spencer also shared some data on Xbox engagement: Microsoft is registering more console users than it has ever had, and game sales on consoles are up double-digits year over year. He briefly mentioned PC and cloud growth, too.</p>

			<p>2024 is not going to see any major PlayStation release from big first-party studios, but the situation will be much different next year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetERA forums, well-known insider shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot42-hot-bot-summer.894603/post-124238742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the games launching next year, saying that they are not games like Rise of the Ronin and Stellar Blade but major titles developed by first-party teams. Unfortunately, the insider did not say how many of these major games will be released next year alongside Death Stranding 2, but this is still good news, considering how dry this year will end up being for major first-party releases.</p>
<p>While 2024 will indeed be a dry year, it's not like no exclusive game is coming out for PlayStation 5 in the next few months. During the latest State of Play presentation aired late last month, the next entry in the Astro Bot series, simply named <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/">Astro Bot</a>, has been announced for a September 6th release date. The upcoming game will expand on concept and mechanics introduced in the underappreciated Astro's Playroom, featuring plenty of PlayStation cameos to boot, including a reference to PaRappa the Rapper.</p>
<p>At this time, no one can say for certain when we will see more of what will be coming to PlayStation 5 next year and beyond. A full-blown Showcase is <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/">rumored</a> to be scheduled for September, so it may take a few more months to see what will be next for Sony's console and possibly its mid-generation <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-silicon/">Pro</a> hardware refresh.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-cooperative-board-games-to-play-in-2024.896598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sometimes it's fun to match wits in a board game with other players in competitive matches. But many of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> go the other way and embrace the spirit of cooperation. Co-op board games come in a wide variety of themes, with varying levels of complexity so you can find one for players of all ages. Below, we've selected our favorites on the market. For more game night ideas, check out our other roundups, including the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">best board games for kids</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">best two-player board games</a>.</p><h3>TLDR: Best Co-op Board Games</h3><p>Have no time to read blurbs? The links above lead directly to retailer pages where you can buy the games in question.</p><h2>Nemesis: Lockdown</h2><div id="196919"><p><h3>Nemesis: Lockdown</h3></p></div><p>Lots of board games have tried to replicate the success of the Alien franchise, but it took this unlicensed homage to perfect it. Players must work together to survive a terrifying incursion of hostile life-forms into a Martian base. You're on a constant high-wire between staying slow and quiet or getting things done fast but attracting alien attention. It’s full of detailed mechanics that can spin the game out in crazy directions, from literal firefighting to a gung-ho battle against the extraterrestrial foe. The challenge is tough, the narrative detailed and the tension always escalating. But the real kicker is that it's possible for your friends not to be friends at all thanks to hidden goal cards that could be supportive or could be murderous, or the corporate military wing could be coming to take you all out to ensure your silence.</p><h2>Sleeping Gods</h2><div id="155166"><p><h3>Sleeping Gods</h3></p></div><p>Narrative-heavy board games have always faced a content problem: there’s only so much variety you can achieve with boards and cards. Sleeping Gods belongs to a family of adventure games that bypassed this problem by putting everything into a huge flip-book, featuring a mix of maps for different quests. Sleeping Gods stands head and shoulders above its peers thanks to two things. First, it’s outstandingly rich storytelling, as you run through a rich mixture of encounters, characters and side-quests as you attempt to guide the lost ship, The Manticore, and her crew home from the strange dimension in which it finds itself. Second, is the detail with which the ship is brought to life, both in terms of strategic resource management to keep her going and her presence in the game world. Such is the wealth of content available that you can easily see a whole different story on a second play through, and such is the fun of doing so that you’ll surely want to try.</p><h2>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h2><div id="157793"><p><h3>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p>This is a “Living Card Game”, which means it’s kind of collectable, like Magic: The Gathering, but there’s no random element. You just buy sets and expansions knowing what cards are in each. And unlike a lot of LCG's, deck building is easy because it’s modular, seeing players pick fixed sets of cards to create decks for their hero and the villain you’re all working against. The meat of play features some classic concepts like dual-use cards alongside novel ideas like each player being able to flip from their hero to their alter-ego, with different abilities and hand sizes. This sets up some really interesting combo-based play where you pull off cinematic moves as you work together to thwart the villain’s schemes and save the day.</p><h2>Frosthaven / Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2><div><div id="155276"><p><h3>Frosthaven</h3></p></div><div id="155277"><p><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p><div><p>Playable as a standalone game, or as an expansion to Gloomhaven.</p></div></div></div><p>To call <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a> a fantasy adventure game is technically accurate, but a bit reductive. It tells the story of mercenaries chasing different goals in a changing world, and the legacy they leave behind. Gloomhaven takes the legacy system from Pandemic Legacy and weaves it into an epic fantasy campaign that takes place over generations. Each hero comes with a personal goal that, when completed, sends the hero into retirement and unlocks new classes and story elements. Upon retiring a hero, you will take control of another, which results in an impressive sense of time progression. The game includes several sealed boxes that are only opened upon reaching certain milestones, which makes Gloomhaven a game with a grand scale that is unmatched in the board game medium.</p><p>This epic game now has a sequel, Frosthaven, with an all-new narrative and fresh subsystems which see you expending and guarding the titular town. And if the price and length of either of the big-box titles turns you off, the excellent prequel Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has most of the gameplay value at a fraction of the price.</p><h2>Exit: The Game (Series)</h2><div id="157810"><p><h3>Exit: The Game</h3></p></div><p>An escape room in a box, the Exit series of games does a surprisingly good job of simulating the real thing. Players work together to find clues and solve riddles in real time in an effort to complete the scenario. Each scenario tells you to bring some pens and a pair of scissors because you’ll be permanently modifying your game throughout the session, making these games a one-and-done experience.</p><p>There are many different scenarios available for purchase, with titles like The Secret Lab, The Abandoned Cabin, The Sinister Mansion, The Forgotten Island, The Mysterious Museum, and a lot more. Priced at around $15 each (and usually <a href="https://zdcs.link/x0D0P" target="_blank">cheaper on Amazon</a>), the Exit series is an ideal replacement for a night at the movies and one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-escape-room-board-games">best escape room board games</a>.</p><h2>Paleo</h2><div id="157812"><p><h3>Paleo</h3></p></div><p>At first glance, this game of stone-age survival doesn’t look anything special. You create a deck of cards for the scenario you want to play and distribute them between the players. Then you take it in turns to flip a card from your pile and face the challenges thereon with the skills and stone tools available to your tiny tribe. The magic happens when tribes come together, pooling their resources to overcome one tough encounter, but doing so loses them the chance to interact with the other tribe’s card. All at once, this mirrors a real slice of stone-age life, agonizing over passing up opportunities in order to secure an important prize, while giving players real emergent cooperation in how much they choose to aid each other. The survival narrative and variety of scenarios are just the icing on the rock cake.</p><h2>Pandemic Legacy</h2><div><div id="161120"><p><h3>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 (Blue Version)</h3></p></div><div id="157783"><p><h3>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 (Red Version)</h3></p></div></div><p>Pandemic put cooperative games on the map, and for good reason. Much of the genre’s hallmark mechanics originated here, from action point allocation to player roles with unique abilities. It also spawned a bevy of expansions and spinoffs, but Pandemic Legacy is the best and more revolutionary take on the virus-eradicating co-op game.</p><p>It takes the core rules of Pandemic and stretches them into a campaign-length adventure played out over several sessions as you race to cure disease and prevent epidemics. This version introduces permanence as a mechanic, as the rules force you to rip up cards, sticker the board and alter the physical components in other ways as things (inevitably) don’t go your way. The only potential drawback is that you must play with the same players each session, but because the game is so good everyone will be eager to jump back in.</p><h2>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</h2><div id="157792"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe Adventures on the Cursed Island</h3></p></div><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a daunting and dark game, but players willing to wade through the sea of iconography, hefty rulebook and stifling theme will be rewarded with a satisfying survival simulation that rewards communication and teamwork. Based on the 1719 novel, players take on the role of survivors of a shipwreck that are must work together to gather food, build shelters, stave off attacks and explore the island. The combination of different scenarios and player characters ensure good replayability, while the survival mechanics do a fantastic job of selling the theme.</p><h2>Just One</h2><div id="157811"><p><h3>Just One</h3></p></div><p>A lot of games on this list are, to a greater or lesser extent, strategy affairs. But cooperation is a great mechanic to use in party games too, and Just One tops the list. All the players bar one get to see a clue, and they have to write down a word related to that clue. Then all the clues get revealed to the remaining player who has to guess the original word. Sounds too simple, except the catch is that if any of the clues are the same they get wiped, leaving the guesser far less to work with. It’s an ingenious idea that leaves players caught in an uncertain vice over just how obscure they cant get away with being, while still being worried they might be the victim of doublethink.</p><h2>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h2><div id="157130"><p><h3>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h3></p></div><p>You likely know trick-taking games from long time classics like Whist and Bridge. The Crew: Mission Deep Sea cleverly repurposes the concept into a cooperative game through the use of missions, demanding that certain players win tricks of particular types. So you might have to win a trick containing a yellow one, for example, or two consecutive tricks or even no tricks at all. This would be easy if you could show each other your cards, so your communication is limited to one card for the entire hand, recasting the game as a strategic puzzle with plenty of tension as you wait to see whether having to follow suit will tease out a critical card or fail the mission. Fast, fun and with fifty varied undersea missions, this is a pearl of a design. This game earned a spot on our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">best family board games</a> list as well.</p><h2>Return to Dark Tower</h2><div id="196920"><p><h3>Return to Dark Tower</h3></p></div><p>Some of you may have childhood memories of the original Dark Tower, an extraordinary 1981 fantasy board game powered by an electronic gizmo that gave it a real sense of magic and wonder. Most copies of that original no longer work, but it’s been resurrected and revamped in this new edition, which features an all-new, all-tech tower that connects to a mobile app via bluetooth. It allows you to select from a far wider variety of characters and quests, villains and monsters than the original. The board layout and major concepts of the original, such as collecting warriors, are retained, but between the app and a raft of new mechanics, the game is transformed into a narratively rich, strategic challenge where you must prioritise and deal with a series of ever-growing threats: it can also be played cooperatively as well as the competitive setup of the original. The app provides detail such as dungeon exploration, while the tower lights up and rotates of its own accord, spilling deadly skulls out into the kingdoms below.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h2><div id="157800"><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</h3></p></div><p>Sherlock Holmes is one of the most enduring fictional characters of all time, and for good reason. Watching him solve a seemingly impossible mystery with all the confidence and bravado of a stage actor has been a favorite pastime of generations of book readers and television watchers.</p><p>With Consulting Detective, you finally get the chance to step into the shoes of Holmes and test your own deduction skills in a series of nonlinear mysteries. What makes the game great is how it refuses to hold your hand; each mystery presents a short setup and then sets you loose on London, leaving you to visit notable locations, interview suspects, and make educated accusations. Be warned, however, that these mysteries are tough, and may make you question your intelligence on more than one occasion.</p><p>If you like these types of games, you can also check out our guide to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery board games</a> for similar options.</p><h2>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h2><div id="155163"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p>If your co-op group could use an eldritch touch, get Arkham Horror: The Card Game to the table. In this cooperative card game, players take on the role of detectives who are investigating various supernatural occurrences within HP Lovecraft’s world of cosmic horror. It’s a scenario-based experience with each mission at the mercy of an arcane Mythos, a set of conditions that must be met lest the investigators succumb to insanity.</p><p>Arkham Horror features customizable decks that are built around each investigator’s special abilities, and most scenarios can play out over a handful of sessions, lending a feeling of progression to the game. As you investigate new location cards, gather clues, and fight monsters, your detective will amass weaknesses that can hinder future games which, thematically, illustrate the mental toll of dealing with arcane horrors. It's a great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board game</a> you can play with loved ones.</p><h2>Spirit Island</h2><div id="155274"><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>Protect your island from a vicious mob of colonizers in this heavy co-op experience. Players are spirits of the land, and must use their unique powers to fend off settlers. Every turn, you’ll play a card from your deck of powers. Matching a card’s element with the element of the spirit usually grants a bonus effect, meaning that careful planning is necessary.</p><p>As the game goes on, the colonists will inevitably spread and ravage the land, making Spirit Island a race against the clock. They’re predictable, though, and if you plan efficiently you can head them off before they do too much damage. Players’ cards combo off of each other nicely, too, and there are few things in tabletop gaming as satisfying as eliminating a host of settlers in one fell swoop. Spirit Island is substantially more complex than other games of this style (Pandemic, Forbidden Island, etc.), making it an ideal choice for those seeking a meatier co-op experience. This game can also be found on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>.</p><h2>Zombicide: Black Plague</h2><div id="157809"><p><h3>Zombicide: Black Plague</h3></p></div><p>Who doesn’t like to bond over some good old fashioned zombie slaying? Zombicide is a cooperative survival game where players work together to complete scenarios. The Black Plague version puts a fantastical spin on the original game, and drops players into the role of paladins, magicians, and knights to take down the evil necromancers responsible for the zombie outbreak.</p><p>You’ll pick up new weapons like crossbows and swords, explore a citadel crawling with the undead, and take on several missions in this dungeon-crawling adventure. It’s a tense and thematically-refreshing take on the tried and true zombie formula with surprisingly easy-to-learn rules.</p><h2>Cthulhu: Death May Die</h2><div id="157807"><p><h3>Cthulhu: Death May Die</h3></p></div><p>Cooperative games where you try and save the world from some deranged monstrosity out of the work of arch-racist HP Lovecraft are ten a penny. What makes Cthulhu: Death May Die stand out isn’t just the beautifully horrible miniatures in the box but the way it integrates help and harm. In order to gain new skills, your characters have to also lose some of their sanity, resulting in a clever balance of tactical trade-offs while encouraging you to come up with daring gameplay plans that deliberately expose yourselves to danger. The resulting reel of cinematic action-horror moments doesn’t feel much like Lovecraft but it is a ton of fun.</p><h2>Upcoming Cooperative Board Games </h2><p>Since being popularised by Pandemic back in 2006, this is a genre that’s gone from strength to strength, and there are always exciting new games waiting in the wings. Perhaps most anticipated right now is the adaptation of the hugely popular video game franchise Mass Effect, coming in late 2024 from the designer Eric Lang, creator of Cthulhu: Death May Die. It promises narratives that fit in perfectly with the original series and exciting campaigns of quick-fire scenarios that you can play to completion in an evening.</p><p>A popular series of tabletop games called Magic Maze just missed out on our top recommendations, but there’s a new one coming soon and it sounds like it could make the grade. Previous Magic Maze games saw players setting up conveyor belts of action chains to complete challenges, and were famous for their hilarious “do something” pawn that you could place in front of another player as the only form of permitted communication. The new game, <a href="https://sitdown-games.com/produit/magic-maze-tower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Maze Towe</a>r, combines that classic gameplay with a new puzzle-solving element to replace the real-time pressure of the original for a calmer, more cerebral take.</p><p>Games based on other media aren’t a new idea but <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cogitoergomeeple/luddite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luddite</a> is an upcoming roll and write title that takes things a step further by being based on a new graphic novel that’s included in the box. The in-game campaign, which can be cooperative or competitive, then follows the story presented in the novel. It’s a puzzly game where you have to use a series of random dice rolls to thread your way across digital maps, which has picked up quite a bit of buzz from previewers, and the flexibility around game modes and player count are big boosts.</p><p><em>For more ideas, check out our roundups of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults"><em>best board games for adults</em></a><em> and the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trivia-board-games"><em>best trivia board games</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

    </div><div>



            <p>GameStop has released its financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2024.</p>
<p>The firm reported a 26% decrease in sales to $882 million, compared to $1.2 billion the previous year. In its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamestop-preliminary-q1-results-have-sales-down-at-least-28">preliminary results shared last month</a>, GameStop expected sales to between $872 million and $892 million.</p>
<p>The retailer reported a net loss of $32.3 million, down 36% compared to $50.5 million during the same quarter last year. It had previously forecast its net loss to be between $27 million and $37 million.</p>
<p>Hardware and accessories made up 57% of its total earnings during Q1, but saw a 30% decline in sales to $505 million, while software sales were down 29% to $240 million, making up 27% of its total earnings.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gamestop-posts-decline-quarterly-sales-2024-06-07/">Reuters</a>, GameStop was initially going to post its Q1 results on June 11, but instead published it last Friday (June 7). The firm did not provide a reason as to why.</p>
<p>GameStop did not provide a conference call with investors following the results, nor did it give an outlook for the current quarter.</p>

<p data-characters="370" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There has been chatter of Microsoft putting out its own handheld Xbox console; in fact, there were rumours of it being announced at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Obviously, that didn’t happen, but when asked about said rumours, Xbox boss Phil Spencer didn’t deny the existence of such a device, even saying he thinks Microsoft should make an Xbox handheld.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">In an <a href="https://youtu.be/IIpMhthwnto?si=1tcXeXeArSOUY3t5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN interview</a> following the showcase, when the topic of the rumoured handheld was brought up, Spencer bluntly said, “I think we should have a handheld,” though quickly refused to comment any further than that. Although he did say being able to play games locally and offline on any such hypothetical device is “really important.” This all makes it sound like an Xbox handheld is, at the very least, being strongly considered, if not outright in the works. If it wasn’t, you’d think Spencer would have shot the very idea down.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Phil Spencer Talks Xbox Showcase, Studio Closures, Xbox Handheld, and More! | IGN Live 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIpMhthwnto?start=1548&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">There have been suggestions of Microsoft abandoning future Xbox hardware entirely thanks to its decision to release some of its first-party exclusives on other platforms. The likes of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sea-of-thieves-is-doing-great-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Thieves</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em> are now on PlayStation 5, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda’s next <em>Doom</em> game</a> is confirmed to be multiplatform, and there’re rumours of even more Xbox IPs following suit, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster-is-reportedly-in-the-works-and-its-apparently-being-considered-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including <em>Halo</em></a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">And yet not only has Spencer teased an Xbox handheld, but the recent showcase also revealed no less than <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-announces-three-brand-new-xbox-series-xs-consoles-including-two-digital-only-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new Xbox Series X|S consoles</a>; all of which are slated to launch later this year. “The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome, and the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I’m incredibly excited about,” added Spencer.</p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="false">At the very least, an Xbox handheld could prove popular, and aid in Microsoft’s goal of making its games more widely available. There’s clearly a market for portable gaming, as demonstrated by the successes of the Steam Deck, the PlayStation Portal, and, of course, the Nintendo Switch. When Microsoft will formally unveil such a device and what it will look like, however, are anyone’s guess.</p>

            <p>Shown off at the PC Gaming Show the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/generation-exile">Generation Exile</a> is a sustainable turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">citybuilder</a> with some real talent behind it. It's being developed by Sonderlust Studios, headed up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a>'s lead designer Nels Anderson, alongside other talented developers like Karla Zimonja, who worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>. Yeah, it's definitely one to watch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Generation Exile is set aboard humanity's final bastion of hope: a big ship where all of its natural resources are dwindling. It's up to you, a hand on a mouse, to click on these resources and bring the ship back to a good state. That's the big switcheroo on the usual citybuilder, it being all about sustainability. You can't just harvest resources from other planets, as you've only got the bits and bobs on your ship.</p>

<p>The dream, then, is to create a circular economy where you're repurposing biological waste and growing new technologies in clever, non-destructive ways. That's all while navigating "real-world ecological calamities and opportunities." The trailer shows some interesting decisions that need to be made, like when your vertical farm's yield exceeds expectations thanks to a rogue fungal growth. Do you aid the growth? Or do you isolate it for analysis? I would aid the growth because it seems nice.</p>
<p>When you start a playthrough, Generation Exile will procedurally generate it each time. Eventually these folks will "form families", and interestingly, memories will "pass down through generations", so choices you made back in the day are remembered in future playthroughs. And those people may not get along in general, so you'll need to not only manage the rogue fungus, but Jackie who's got into a fight with Mark, because Mark heated up some sustainably caught fish in their solar-powered microwave for lunch.</p>
<p>The game's due out sometime in 2025 and you can follow the its progress over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963240/Generation_Exile/">Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Fallout 5 may release sooner than anticipated, thanks to the smashing success of the Amazon Prime Video TV show, judging from some recent comments from Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a> in an interview conducted after yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, the Xbox head talked about the post-apocalyptic franchise, saying that the TV show has been amazing for them and that Bethesda's director Todd Howard is looking at the plans on what he's doing. While Phil Spencer couldn't say more on the matter, he said that Todd Howard has recognized the TV show's success on his own and is thinking through what that means, suggesting that plans for a new entry in the series may have been sped up by the show's success.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phil Spencer Talks Xbox Showcase, Studio Closures, Xbox Handheld, and More! | IGN Live 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIpMhthwnto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"For us specifically, Fallout's (TV) been amazing, and yeah, Todd's kind of looking at the plans on what he's doing. I'm not going to get into it, but I'll say Todd has recognized the success on his own and is thinking through what that means."</em></p>
<p>The fact that Bethesda may be accelerating its Fallout 5 plans isn't surprising, considering how all recent entries in the series saw a massive boost in player numbers following the launch of the TV Show, with Fallout 76 recently passing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/">20 million players milestone</a>. Hopefully, the studio won't rush the game and will deliver an experience that will be on par with the rest of the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The "wonderfully simple" winning recipe of Wholesome Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wonderfully-simple-winning-recipe-of-wholesome-direct</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-wonderfully-simple-winning-recipe-of-wholesome-direct.896580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wonderfully-simple-winning-recipe-of-wholesome-direct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The fifth edition of Wholesome Direct took place on Saturday, presenting over 70 indie games.</p>
<p>Originating as a Twitter account by founder Matthew Taylor in 2019, Wholesome Games evolved to become not only a yearly digital showcase from 2020, but also a monthly newsletter, and a large community of like-minded people gathered around the best and brightest cosy games.</p>
<p>This year's Direct saw new trailers for highly awaited titles like Tiny Bookshop, Dungeons of Hinterberg, and Été, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/our-favourite-indie-games-from-the-2023-summer-games-showcases">highlight of last year's showcase</a> that is out this July. But it also presented a wealth of new titles, most of them debut games from small indie studios, like Mythmatch, Caravan SandWitch, Littlelands, and many more. A platform for leftfield ideas and silly concepts, the event also delighted us by showcasing Optillusion's While Waiting.</p>
<p>Wholesome Direct feels like a safe space for an entire fringe of the games community and industry that's often been underserved. It gives a platform to underrepresented games, genres, creators, and cultures. This year, for instance, it showcased Niku Games' The Palace on the Hill, a coming-of-age story set in 90s rural India, and Sticky Brain Studios' Rooster, which celebrates ancient Chinese culture. In previous years, the showcase had been giving space to Visai Games' now multi-award winning narrative cooking title Venba as well.</p>
<p>Giving a platform to marginalised voices has always been part of the show's vision, Taylor tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Wholesome Games founder Matthew Taylor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"I think as soon as I realised we had a platform of any meaning whatsoever, I wanted to integrate that into it because that's just another component of changing the industry in a good way that will hopefully outlast Wholesome as a label," he says. "That's a positive impact we can make that literally changes people's lives."</p>
<p>This vision is further exemplified by Wholesome Direct being the only show last week acknowledging the situation in Gaza and showing solidarity to Palestine, with <a href="https://theyetee.com/collections/wholesomegames">sales of its merch going to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about Venba more specifically, Taylor continues: "Knowing that we had any impact whatsoever on a developer getting such an important project out is maybe the proudest moment for me in Wholesome Games, so that's why it's important to me."</p>
<p>While Wholesome Direct often features a variety of presenters throughout, organiser and host Jenny Windom returned this year to helm the event. She explains that developers' lived experience is encompassed in what the team considers 'wholesome.'</p>
<p>"When we started talking about wholesomeness and what we were hoping to curate, I thought a lot about specifics, how we really, in this wholesome ethos, look at details within games," she says. "A lot of things that people find wholesome are things like little details of [a] kitchen, or the way that the plants are animated. What's really interesting, to carry that over into these stories from developers that we haven't heard from, is that a lot of them are really specific.</p>
<p>"So it's this idea [of] enjoying not only the specifics in our daily lives that we can make more magical and more cosy in a lot of ways, but also taking the specifics of people's lived experiences and really appreciating them for what they are, and allowing people to share them."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Niku Games' The Palace on the Hill released on Saturday off the back on the Wholesome Direct</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's something the Wholesome Games team has been vocal about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shaping-a-warm-welcome-for-wholesome-games">from the get go</a>: 'cosy' or 'wholesome' isn't a set of specific criteria, it's a vision and a vibe, it's gathering games based on an emotion rather than a genre or a gameplay loop.</p>
<p>Taylor says that every year he hopes that Wholesome Direct is almost the "state of the union" of "If you view it as a whole, you have an idea of what we're looking for."</p>
<p>"When we first started Wholesome Games, I kept saying I want to curate games by the way they make me feel instead of how you play them," he adds.</p>
<p>Windom concurs, saying that the selection process isn't checking boxes against set criteria.</p>
<p>"A lot of it is, truly, we all take a look at every game and have this initial gut impression of what [we] are drawn to. And we've learnt to really trust our gut. For me in particular, I try to look and see not only at what each game individually brings to the table and what gets me excited about them, but also how it fits in that whole showcase.</p>
<p>"If we have a lot of one type of genre, or if we have a lot of one certain type of art style – especially since we're curating within a niche – it can all feel very similar after a certain point.</p>
<p>So looking in really intentionally, trying to curate not simply just what we're attracted to but also a variety of titles. We've seen huge creativity from developers [on] what their interpretation of wholesomeness looks like, so that's been really fun."</p>

<p>Taylor adds that the team really values showing games for the first time, providing a very welcome boost early in indie studios' marketing cycle. Wholesome Games has a 'developer first' approach, which it's taken even further by launching its own label, Wholesome Games Presents. The initiative offers funding, QA, marketing, publishing support, and more. So far it's worked on two successful releases: Doot &amp; Blibloop's Minami Lane, and Jess Yu's Usagi Shima.</p>
<p>While familiar with both these titles, we express our surprise at the fact we didn't realise until recently that Wholesome Games had an involvement in these games beyond the Direct.</p>
<p>"It almost feels by design that you didn't know about it because it's something I'm very eager to start slowly, and build, as opposed to just busting out of the gate and saying 'here we are'," Taylor says.</p>
<p>"The desire was always there for me, to work more directly with certain developers. Mainly games that were small and maybe wouldn't have the eyes on them without our help. And then I started looking at the people we do have on our team here like Jenny and Victoria [Tran, Innersloth's communications director and also Wholesome Direct organiser] and the knowledge that we've all gained either from Wholesome Games or from our day jobs. And it just started to click that we could really offer a little bit more help for a few select games, whether that's just helping them make connections that we've garnered, or offering a little bit of outside perspective."</p>

<p>Wholesome Games Presents wishes to target titles that want to remain small and that do "not care too much about becoming a worldwide phenomenon or a game that's going to make a million dollars so that executives can be happy with it," Taylor says.</p>
<p>Windom adds: "Having Wholesome Presents is really a response to what we've seen in the industry, especially in terms of funding [and] sustainable game development. A lot of teams may not be able to acquire funds, not because the funds aren't available but because they're not seen as viable scalable products.</p>
<p>"This idea of putting support into smaller studios and smaller games is one that moves into a model of sustainability for the industry that I would love to keep doing through Wholesome Presents, and would love to see even more folks participating in, because I think it's one that will help bolster a portion of our industry that does not often get to flourish."</p>
<blockquote><p>"A lot of teams may not be able to acquire funds, not because the funds aren't available but because they're not seen as viable scalable products"<cite>Jenny Windom</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cosy games have been the subject of mockery in the past, often from a toxic fringe of the gaming community that foolishly considers that they're "not really video games." The explosion of farming sims in 2020 off the back of Animal Crossing: New Horizons' success even led to some increasing snark in the games industry itself, with some inexplicably irritated by the concept.</p>
<p>We ask the Wholesome Games team whether they think there's enough recognition for the type of games they're showcasing.</p>
<p>"It's growing, I think it's going to take time, there will always be a little bit of a bias against colourful and optimistic games [in this kind of] industry," Taylor answers. "We have <a href="https://wholesomegames.com/#faq:~:text=For%20many%20years%2C%20the%20most%20critically%20acclaimed%20titles%20have%20been%20the%20ones%20with%20the%20darkest%20themes%20and%20grimmest%20depictions%20of%20life%2C%20but%20there%27s%20also%20a%20whole%20world%20of%20hopeful%20video%20games%20with%20rich%20storytelling%2C%20innovative%20gameplay%2C%20and%20beautiful%20art%20and%20sound">something in our FAQ</a> [about] the games that win awards are often the more gritty, pessimistic-looking games. And maybe that's even true in other mediums too, but I have hope that it'll catch up.</p>
<p>"Even though five years seems like a long time to me working on it, I don't think it's that long in terms of how long the industry's been around, and how long the focus has been on a completely different kind of player and a completely different kind of audience."</p>
<p>We think about the success of Venba, truly a testament to the fact that a different kind of game can win awards and be taken seriously.</p>

</figure>
<p>While Wholesome Direct started during the COVID-19 lockdowns and off the back of the 'New Horizons effect', Taylor adds that the show has continuously grown since, showing that "the players are there, and they're going to stay there, it's not just a temporary thing."</p>
<p>"I think the environment has changed, but the way we make the Showcase is still pretty similar to how it was five years ago, which is wonderfully simple and hopefully really accessible," he adds.</p>
<p>Windom continues: "Even though folks aren't necessarily locked down or quarantined in their homes in the way that they were a few years ago, the state of the world is still pretty dire and there are still a lot of people who are looking for some sort of escape or solace.</p>
<blockquote>"We've got a strong foundation [and] I think it'd be cool to have some sort of physical presence"<cite>Matthew Taylor</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>"People are still seeking out media that isn't simply comforting but also perhaps provides space for them to grapple with some of these harder conversations and harder topics."</p>
<p>We ask the pair what they envision for the future of the Wholesome Games brand, both for the Direct and the publishing label.</p>
<p>"It's interesting because the default answer is 'I want to grow', and I do, in the sense that I want to be able to help even more than we are right now and have more avenues to help," Taylor starts. "I really think we've got a strong foundation between the social presence that continues to elevate games throughout the years, and then the Direct. And now Presents is just a little more of a direct way. So I don't know, but I think it'd be cool to have some sort of physical presence.</p>
<p>"I remember being at PAX East in 2020, just before the pandemic. And that was when a lot of [our] ideas really came to [fruition]. That was the first time I ever met Jenny in person. So many things happened there and I can't help but want that again now that more people know what Wholesome Games is. And in the same way you might go to a convention and know, 'I'm going to go right to that booth because I trust that they're going to have something cool', it would be neat to do something like that. A lot of logistics have to happen for something like that to happen, that luckily we don't have to worry about as much for digital stuff, but that would be a cool next step."</p>

</figure>
<p>Windom is looking forward to seeing more takes from developers about how they perceive wholesomeness, and is keen for Wholesome Games to grow too, but in a way that makes sense for what it represents.</p>
<p>"[Growing] in the way that we've already been really trying and doing," she explains, "which is being very intentional about it, and not worrying about growth for the sake of magnitude, scale and speed, but growth for the sake of making sure that what we're doing is done right; right by the developers that we're working with, and right by the community who's trusted us for years."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
It looks like Avowed is aiming for a November release date. 
</p>
<p>
In a short blog post shared by developer Obsidian last night, the upcoming RPG was listed as launching on 12th November. This came as a surprise to many, as there was no mention of this date during last night's Xbox showcase, where a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avoweds-new-story-trailer-shows-a-three-way-fight-for-the-living-lands-but-still-no-firm-release-date">new Avowed story trailer</a> was debuted. 
</p>
<p>
During the Xbox Showcase, Microsoft merely said the game was still on course to release at some point this year, with no further specifics. That was, until the developer shared a follow-up post on its website.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Perhaps realising its error (but not before the <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1799950020038504727">internet</a> noticed), Obsidian has since amended its post, and scrubbed any mention of that November release date. 
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's post once read: "The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting. Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we've been busy with Avowed getting it ready for release on 12th November, 2024. Today, we're thrilled to have revealed our first-ever story trailer at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and to talk with you more about what we've shared."
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer">now reads</a> very similarly, but with those all important dates removed: "The last few months at Obsidian Entertainment have been fast-paced and exciting. Since we saw you at the Xbox Developer Direct this past January, we've been busy with Avowed. Today, we're thrilled to have revealed our first-ever story trailer at Xbox Games Showcase 2024, and to talk with you more about what we've shared."
</p>
<p>
Xbox has made no mention on whether this release date for Avowed is accurate. Eurogamer has asked for further comment. 
</p>
<p>
For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures">our Chris sat down with Avowed's director Carrie Patel and art director Matt Hansen</a> to find out more about what we can expect when the game releases later this year.

            <p>
Life is Strange fans have criticised an Ultimate Edition version of the game which gives "advanced access to Chapters 1 and 2", two weeks ahead of its main release date. 
</p>
<p>
Announced last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">Life if Strange: Double Exposure sees the return of the series' original protagonist Max Caulfield, now grown up</a>, but still dealing with a dead best friend. 
</p>
<p>
Double Exposure is set to launch for PC, PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S on 29th October, priced $50. But if you buy the pricier Ultimate Edition, you can play its opening chapters on 15th October, for $80.

<p>
The Ultimate Edition also includes an array of alternative cosmetic options for Max, as well as an additional side-quest involving cats.
</p>
<p>
As well as being a push for more money from fans, there's been criticism also of the inevitable story spoilers that will hit the internet as soon as some players gain access to Double Exposure's opening sections.
</p>
<p>
"Don't miss your chance to join the conversation around this unforgettable supernatural murder mystery," notes Square Enix marketing for the game's Ultimate Edition on Steam.
</p>
<p>
For a game entirely designed as a narrative experience, these concerns are perhaps unsurprising - and there's been negative feedback on reddit and social media. 
</p>
<p>
"People will buy it Day 1 just because they have the money and love Max," one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/">wrote</a>. "Hate this practice so much, especially in this genre where spoilers can ruin the experience."
</p>
<p>
"To avoid getting caught up in spoilers I will be pre-ordering the Ultimate Edition," another fan wrote. "A very bad decision by Square Enix."

<p>The vibrant town shines with a bustling economy, featuring such indispensable stores as ‘Milk and Wheat’, and ‘Brada’. I can only assume the later is for spunking your meagre chef’s income on dazzling gifts to bribe potential friends into hanging out with you more.</p>
<p>Your daily activities in the world of Chef RPG are based around using hilariously improper equipment to gather ingredients, including but not limited to: scything mushrooms, shooting down bees’ nests with a bow, spearing crabs, hunting extremely rare and graceful looking deer with the same bow, and fishing. You’ll then put these ingredients to use in your custom restaurant, hosting dining experiences for the townsfolk and freshly bribed mates. Aside from running the restaurant, you’ll be designing menus and keeping things looking swish by plopping down furniture. There’s also farming and brewing, in case the nuclear submarine I assume you use for picking strawberries isn’t working that day.</p>
<p>Pixel Architect, of developer World 2 Studio, has been releasing <a href="https://youtu.be/bhXOwK7m8l8">a series of devlogs</a> on YouTube over the past three years. Their latest is a deep dive into the role food critics and parties play in the game, as well as an overview of the restaurant. From time to time, the log explains, critics will visit your restaurant and write up newspaper reviews. You’ll also be able to hire out the restaurant for special events, where your guests will require certain types of cuisine and decor.</p>
<p>Being the ridiculous bowl of pretenti-o’s that I am, I of course had a period in my early twenties where I watched too many TV chefs and decided that I was actually a culinary genius, ala <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezv8gzbtAVg">that ProZD sketch</a>. What I quickly learned is that working in food service is one of the most mentally and physically taxing jobs I’ve ever held, and also that I wasn’t very good at frying eggs. Kudos to anyone who pulls this stuff off full time. Me? I’ll have to make do with living out my gastronomic fantasies in pixel form, when Chef RPG releases in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796790/Chef_RPG/">September 12th, 2024. </a></p>

			<p>Demonschool, the tactical role-playing game in development by Necrosoft Games inspired by ATLUS' Persona series, is launching in a few months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>As really apt for a game with strong horror movie vibes, the game will launch on September 13th, which is a Friday. You can check out the release date announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demonschool - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbiJTs1h8kY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last week, I had the chance to try out Demonschool, and I was rather <a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/">impressed</a> by its visuals, atmosphere, and combat system, which features some unique quirks that set it apart from similar titles.</p>
<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>
<p>Demonschool launches on September 13th for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Last night, Microsoft unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">three new Xbox consoles</a> set to hit the market. However, despite previous rumours that such a platform was in development, there was no word on any handheld Xbox gaming device.</p>
<p>Following the show, Phil Spencer sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">IGN</a>, where he was asked specifically about an Xbox handheld device, and the company's mantra of 'going where the players are'. And, despite no Xbox handheld device being officially confirmed (nor denied), Spencer agreed: "I think we should have a handheld".</p>

<p>Said Spencer: "The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome, and the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about. Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</p>
<p>When further asked, all very hypothetically, whether any future handheld Xbox console would be more akin to a Steam Deck that could be played offline, or a cloud-based piece of kit, Spencer said: "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<p>It feels like Spencer has all but confirmed a handheld Xbox gaming device is on the cards, and it will support offline play. The idea of an Xbox handheld is nothing new. Back in 2017, Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-xbox-handheld-was-designed-in-the-past-says-phi/1100-6449311/">Microsoft had "roughly designed an Xbox handheld"</a> in the past. Meanwhile, the Xbox exec has been spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1753539464071094493">interacting with social media posts about handheld devices</a> as recently as this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during his conversation with IGN, Spencer addressed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-acknowledges-hard-decisions-to-close-studios-in-first-public-comment">closure of Tango Gameworks earlier this year</a>, and the decision to bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox and PC</a>.</p>

            <p>
Xbox boss Phil Spencer has discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">the company's recent  steps into multiplatform publishing</a> - and confirmed there's more to come.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-briefly-explains-the-decision-to-bring-doom-the-dark-ages-to-playstation-5-ign-live-2024">IGN Live</a> just hours after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Xbox confirmed another big title - Doom: The Dark Ages - would launch on PlayStation 5</a> as well as PC and Xbox Series X/S, Spencer was clear that Xbox's multiplatform plans were here to stay. 
</p>
<p>
"You're going to see more of our games on more platforms," Spencer said. "And we just see that as a benefit to the franchises we're building. And we see that from the players, that love to be able to play."

<p>
On Doom: The Dark Ages specifically, Spencer said the decision to launch id Software's shooter on PS5 came from id Software itself.
</p>
<p>
"Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms," Spencer continued. "It's a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. 
</p>
<p>
"When I was in a meeting with Marty [Stratton, id Software studio director] a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that."
</p>
<p>Exactly which other Xbox games past and future might also launch on PlayStation - or Nintendo - platforms was not discussed, however.</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-acknowledges-hard-decisions-to-close-studios-in-first-public-comment">Spencer also finally addressed the recent studio closures within Microsoft</a>, which saw Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin close their doors, among others.

            <p>
Xbox boss Phil Spencer has commented publicly for the first time on recent Microsoft studio closures, stating he has to "run a sustainable business inside the company and grow".
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Xbox made the shock decision to close a number of Bethesda studios</a>, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.
</p>
<p>
Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">IGN</a>, Spencer has finally addressed the closures.

<p>
"The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team," he said. "I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR. It's about those teams.
</p>
<p>
"In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to go forward. We will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."
</p>
<p>
Spencer's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-president-responds-to-studio-closures-as-commitment-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">echo those of Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, who was interviewed shortly after the closures were announced.
</p>
<p>
"It's always extraordinarily hard when you have to make decisions like that," Bond said. "When we looked at those fundamental [industry] trends we feel a deep responsibility to ensure that the games we make, the devices we build, the services that we offer are there through moments. Even when the industry isn't growing, when you're through a time of transition.
</p>
<p>
"The news we announced earlier in the week is an outcome of that, in our commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">studio closures were met with widespread criticism</a> from across the industry, especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-potential-new-dishonored-were-reportedly-being-pitched-by-now-closed-xbox-studios">both Tango and Arkane Austin were reportedly set to work on new games</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft laid off 1900 people across its video game teams</a>. This year alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off across the video game industry</a>, with Microsoft being the biggest contributor.

</p>
<p>The interview follows last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase - here's everything that was shown</a>.</p>

            <p>We continue to rummage through the debris caused by the horrendous pile-up of summer video game announcements. Among the wreckage, a release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>, the funny strategy game in which you play a ragtag crew of uniformed magic-zappers clearing enemies in confined spaces. It's not XCOM, but it is XCOM-ing soon. That's about as good a joke as I can muster on a Monday morning. Don't worry, there are funnier ones in the trailer below.</p>

<p>As the tray-tray reveals, the upcoming release date is August 22nd, and it was announced as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/X8trymrr_Fc?feature=shared&amp;t=9716">yesterday's PC Gaming Show</a>, the festival of frolics put together by cheery RPS fan zine PC Gamer. Unfortunately, they used the wrong version of the game's trailer and mistakenly announced the release date as two days earlier than it really is. Never mind, we know the real date now. </p>
<p>Mistakes happen. In fact, Tactical Breach Wizards is made by Suspicious Developments, aka Tom Francis, the creator of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gunpoint">Gunpoint</a>. "Mistakes happen" could be the generalised design philosophy of Tom's games. Or "systemic silliness" if you want to get all fancy schmancy. Wizards looks to be following that trend, with funny dialogue and colourful characters, at least judging by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tactical-breach-wizards-is-refreshingly-unlike-xcom-despite-wearing-the-same-tactical-underwear">what Nic has seen in the game's Next Fest demo</a>.</p>
<p>"You know you’re in for a cracking time when, alongside scores for speed and efficiency, the results screen bookending each room tallies up your total, and I quote, defenestrations," he wrote. "These compact room-levels are effectively just window delivery systems."</p>
<p>The next question is: if you throw an enemy back through the broken window, is that a "<em>re</em>fenestration"? I cannot be the first to have thought of this gag. I probably heard it somewhere years ago. Probably a Tom Francis game.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Tom Francis is a former PC Gamer journalist who has also written for RPS in the past.</em> </p>

        <p>Microsoft Gaming boss said "now is the time for us to focus" but adds "we're doing the right thing" for those affected</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Phil Spencer has addressed the backlash to Xbox's recent studio closures, emphasising that there were "hard decisions" that needed to be made "to run a sustainable business."</p>
<p>Phil Spencer was interviewed on stage during IGN Live in Los Angeles on Sunday, where he was asked about Xbox's decision last month to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">close four ZeniMax-owned studios</a>, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush creator Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>According to a write-up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">IGN</a>, Spencer said: "The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team. I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is the time for us to focus on the team and the individuals.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR. It's about those teams.</p>
<p>"In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make.</p>
<p>"We will continue to go forward. We will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."</p>
<p>Spencer's comments echo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-president-our-commitment-is-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">those of Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, who said in the days following the studio closures that the platform holder's committent is to "[making] sure that the business is healthy for the long term."</p>
<p>The remaining staff at ZeniMax's studios are <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-staff-now-included-in-microsoft-and-cwas-labour-neutrality-agreement">now covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement with US union Communication Workers of America</a>, meaning the platform holder is legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of its staff.</p>
<p>The IGN account on X (formerly Twitter) also <a href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1799934935685554406">posted highlights</a> from Spencer's interview, including his response to rumours that Xbox is working on a Steam Deck-like handheld.</p>
<p>"I don't want to say anything, but the future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," he said. "Today was about the games, but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform."</p>
<p>When asked, if an Xbox handheld did exist, whether it would be playable without an internet connections, Spencer said: "I think the ability to play a game locally is very important."</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will require your PC or console to be connected to the internet at all times to use texture streaming, including when you’re playing the game’s Campaign mode which doesn’t feature any multiplayer elements. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">This was confirmed on the official Activision website, with the section about the decision reading: “To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, <em>Black Ops 6</em> will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign.”</p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">This means that if your internet goes down, or you simply don’t have a connection at any time, you won’t be able to play <em>Black Ops 6</em>, even though the Campaign doesn’t feature multiplayer.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You’ll not see any of <em>Black Ops 6</em>‘s game modes without an internet connection. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">Texture streaming is a tool used in <em>Call of Duty</em> to provide extra detail and quality to the graphics of your game while attempting to keep the game’s file size as small as possible. Instead of bundling these graphics into the file to be installed on your computer, on-demand texture streaming downloads them via the internet while you’re playing. </p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Activision developed it to “reduce the game’s overall package size by removing certain textures rarely used or encountered by players. If players encounter an Operator or Weapon that uses a high-resolution texture, it will be streamed to the PC [or console’s] cache as needed.”</p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">While this is massive for keeping our hard drives from filling up, it does mean that we’ll never be able to play the game without an internet connection. However, this trade-off is worth it for many players, and I’d be inclined to agree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-june-update-improves-melee-adds-bounty-hunting-features-and-paid-dlc-missions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right in the middle of the Xbox Game Showcase 2024, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> not only the first trailer for the Shattered Space expansion but also the announcement that <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5fJOins2DKdriTNVBvBjdR/starfield-update-1-12-30-june-9-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Starfield update</a> had been released.</p>
<p>Following the showcase, Bethesda released a deep-dive video in which the game's developers unveiled the new features and content. One of the big changes is that melee weapons will finally have new tiers, providing increasing damage stats. Moreover, melee weapons will be available for improvement through the crafting system. Ammunition for ranged weapons can finally be crafted, too, after many requests from the community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a bounty hunting scanner system has been added to the game, allowing players to scan non-player characters (NPCs) and check if they are wanted and, if so, for which felony. You will then have the chance to resolve the situation peacefully - or not. This ties into the new Tracking Alliance mission system, which features a free new mission where players are welcomed into this faction after a trial run of apprehending a thief of spaceships. Subsequent Tracking Alliance missions will be paid, though. The first one, called The Vulture, is already available for purchase for 1000 Premium Credits ($9.99). In this mission, players must track down a former sniper of the First Cavalry gone rogue. The good news is that owners of Starfield Premium Edition are given a complimentary 1000 Premium Credits, so they can pick up that mission right away if they wish.</p>

<p>The latter half of the deep dive video discusses Creations, the platform that debuted on Skyrim in late 2023. This features both Bethesda-made additional content and user-made content, both free and premium. Players can already find new quests, luxury homes, suits, modules, and even a ramen stand.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Starfield-Creations-Menu-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Several Verified Creators have already announced future plans to make new missions, additional companions, new weapons (possibly with multi-firing mode), and more. Of course, anyone can make Starfield content now with the Creation Kit available for download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam.</a></p>

            <p>"Deus Ex but tiny and hilarious" is how I pitch the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue">Streets of Rogue</a> to people in elevators. Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue-2">Streets of Rogue 2</a> is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.</p>

<p>Did you catch the guy doing a drive-by shooting from the back of a bear? This is the sort of delightful tomfoolery we can expect of developer Matt Dabrowski, who started making the roguelike sequel partly because adding more and more stuff to the previous game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-creator-wants-to-ramp-up-the-carnage-with-a-sequel">starting to break things</a>. Here the freedom to go wild is expanded. You'll be able to build stuff and farm a little cabbage patch, for example. Also, it looks like lots of silly, toy-like vehicles are planned.</p>
<p>"Cruise the highways in style with souped-out luxury cars or goof around in high-speed boat races," says this blood-caked press release. "Travel through a massive procedurally generated map, always changing with countless surprises..." It makes sense that the maps will be bigger than before. I imagine you'll need the space for all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-co-op-cocktails-for-total-carnage-in-streets-of-rogue">zombies you are going to unleash</a>. But the goal is still roughly the same as the first game - take down the corrupt President at the top of it all.</p>
<p>You see, in the first Streets of Rogue you could play as an experimental gorilla and beat a bunch of scientists to death to free your gorilla friends from their cage. You could be a dirty cop and arrest innocent civilians for kicks. You could be a vampire, a shapeshifter, an investment banker with a furious cocaine habit. But you were supposed to be climbing the floors of a towering megacity to face the mayor. I never did hit that endgame, because I was having too good a time elsewhere. Once in a while I'd get a couple of floors further but, inevitably, I'd end up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-hacking-games">hacking</a> ATMs and annoying the police or accidentally gassing all my friends in co-op. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-review">the best kind of bedlam</a>. </p>

		<p>Ancient Forge has unveiled its latest game, a hotel management simulator that allows players to construct and manage a hotel serving guests from across the galaxy. Hotel Galactic will encompass all aspects of hotel management, including construction, room upgrades, food cultivation, dealing with upset guests, and keeping the guests entertained.</p>
<p><iframe title="HOTEL GALACTIC - WORLD ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5PjZNMq6Do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p dir="ltr"><em>“Hotel Galactic&nbsp;is a massive step forward for all of us at Ancient Forge,”</em> said Maksymilian Strezelecki, Vice President and Technical Director.<em> “It’s an idea that had been percolating for a couple of years in pre-production, as we took our time to make sure the design and all its constituent parts meshed well to create this beautiful, nostalgic world. The technical demands were substantial, but the end result is a dynamic, immersive experience that I’m proud to share.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Hotel Galactic&nbsp;is the project that utilizes everything we’ve learned in the last ten years or so,”</em> said Dushan Chaciej, CEO and Creative Director at Ancient Forge. <em>“We aimed to create a wholesome and engaging experience for players that love to watch their simulated little dudes end up in all kinds of weird situations. Personally, I can’t wait to see what the world thinks of what we’ve been working on for the past three years.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As the hotel proprietor, managing the entirety of Hotel Galactic single-handedly is not something you can, so assembling a team is essential. The staff will be responsible for catering to every guest’s needs and ensuring the hotel remains clean to maintain its reputation. While the staff take care of things, players will be able to explore an underground system, grow plants, and raise livestock.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hotel Galactic has been confirmed for PC, PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, and the Switch, but a release date is to be announced. Additionally, Ancient Forge will be running a Kickstarter from July 9th to July 30th, with each milestone allowing the development team to add new features. Those who back the Kickstarter will have the chance to win &nbsp;to win exclusive add-ons and assets, as well as take part in an alpha play test.</p>

Earlier this year he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073723/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-hardware-phil-spencer-handheld">said he was “a big fan of handhelds,”</a> after liking posts on X that mention the possibility of this new hardware. Now, in an interview with <em>IGN</em> Spencer says “I think we should have a handheld, too.”</p><p>It’s the biggest hint yet that Microsoft is working on an Xbox handheld, something that’s been long-rumored. “The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. The work that the team is doing around different form factors and different ways to play, I’m incredibly excited about,” said Spencer. “Today was about the games... but we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform.”</p><p>Pressed on whether an Xbox handheld would stream games or play them locally, Spencer dropped a further hint that Microsoft is looking at a true handheld gaming device rather than something like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a>. “I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck. I think being able to play games locally is really important,” said Spencer.</p><p>Earlier this year Spencer talked about wanting a compact Xbox mode on a handheld gaming PC. “I want to be able to boot into the Xbox app in a full screen, but in a compact mode,” said Spencer in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview"><em>Polygon&nbsp;</em>interview</a>. “Like I want it to feel like the dash of my Xbox when I turn on the television. [Except I want it] on those devices.”</p><p>I suspect what Microsoft is working on is an Xbox handheld that’s Windows-based, but that has the ability to run Xbox games and the full Xbox dashboard. On&nbsp;<em>The Vergecast </em>earlier this year, <a href="https://t.co/ItmeVS36Wa">I discussed</a>&nbsp;my ideal for an Xbox handheld. It would run Windows at its core but never expose this to you so it looks and feels like an Xbox console, but if you want to run Steam games or Xbox games, you can.</p><p>That would require Microsoft to pull off merging Xbox and Windows together in a way we haven’t seen before, but with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">the future of Xbox looking a lot like a PC</a> it feels more inevitable than ever.</p><div><div><h2>Notepad by Tom Warren<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.</p></div><p><a href="http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter">Subscribe</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">four Xbox-exclusive games</a> were launching on PS5 and some on Nintendo Switch, with fans left wondering if it would only be four titles or if there are more to come. Spencer took the opportunity to clear up that mystery in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIIpMhthwnto">interview with <em>IGN</em></a><em> </em>yesterday.</p><p>“Our commitment to our Xbox customers is you’re going to get the opportunity to buy or subscribe to the game, and we’re going to support the game on other screens,” said Spencer. “You are going to see more of our games on more platforms, and we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we’re building, and we see that from players, and the players love to be able to play.”</p><p>The confirmation of more games coming to rival platforms comes months after Spencer denied there was a change to Microsoft’s strategy of Xbox exclusives. “We made a decision that we’re going to take four games to the other consoles, just four games. Not a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy,” said Spencer <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKGlD9SO3rKU">in an Xbox podcast</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Microsoft unveiled a collection of new Xbox games during its big showcase event last night, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></a> the big new “world premiere” titles. One word Microsoft didn’t use all night was exclusive, though. It’s something I’ve noticed the company has been avoiding for months now. Microsoft-owned Arkane Lyon unveiled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23992733/arkane-lyon-marvel-blade-game"><em>Blade </em>game</a> late last year at the Game Awards, and there was no mention of exclusivity for Xbox. </p><p>We also got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040391/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gameplay-trailer-xbox-bethesda">first look</a> at Bethesda’s new <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> game earlier this year, and while Xbox and PC were confirmed as launch platforms, there was no mention of exclusivity. I understand Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release">weighing up launching</a> <em>Indiana Jones</em> on PS5 several months after the planned launch for Xbox later this year.</p><p>All of these decisions are part of “Project Latitude” inside Microsoft, a secretive project that I recently detailed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">in my weekly Notepad newsletter</a>. Microsoft is considering a number of games for rival platforms, including the recently-released <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II game. </em>You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">read more about Project Latitude here</a>.</p><p><em>IGN </em>didn’t press Spencer further on the Xbox multiplatform plans, and Microsoft largely avoided the elephant in the room during its showcase by never mentioning rival platforms. Instead, it focused on a barrage of game trailers that resulted in one of the best Xbox showcases I’ve seen in years.</p><div><div><h2>Notepad by Tom Warren<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.</p></div><p><a href="http://theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter">Subscribe</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Phantom Line was possibly one of the most impressive showcases featured in Summer Game Fest 2024's PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>Labeled as 'paranormal SWAT', this is a cooperative tactical first-person shooter game in development at <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-cyberpunk-2077-and-bioshock-devs-form-antistatic-studios-alongside-debut-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANTISTATIC Studios</a>, a Polish team composed of former Cyberpunk 2077 and BioShock developers.</p>
<p>Set in a 'post-nuclear' version of Europe, it puts players in the role of an operator enrolled in an elite special operations unit that handles paranormal events. Employed by Mortfield Industries, the player character will be sent to the so-called Iron Corridor in Eastern Europe, where one of Mortfield's research facilities has suddenly gone dark.</p>
<p>One of the players' biggest assets is the H.U.S.K. program that allows them to transfer consciousness between artificial bodies. H.U.S.K.s can be used strategically to scout, distract, decoy, and more.</p>
<p>The world of Phantom Line is full of paranormal creatures and unexplained phenomena dubbed “anomalies.” These leak into the world through rifts in the space-time fabric.</p>
<p>Players will have their base of operations in the nuclear-powered Icebreaker ship. Here, they will get to customize their H.U.S.K. and cabin, showcase weapons and armor to friends, and, most importantly, modify their gear and body.</p>
<p>Phantom Line's gameplay also includes survival elements, such as hunting and cooking wild animals. Players must utilize any available resources, gear up, and adjust their tactics to the situation on the ground.</p>
