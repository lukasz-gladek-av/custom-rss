<p>Coming to Switch later this month</p>

<p>French studio Seed for Seed — the developer behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pile_up_box_by_box">Pile Up</a> and <strong>Jump the Track</strong> — is bringing its cosy co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/baladins">Baladins</a> to Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Blending the tabletop co-operative experience with unique RPG gameplay, you and three friends can team up to explore Gatherac to help save the land, help the locals, and experience your own unique adventure. You can get a good feel of what to expect from the PC release date trailer up top.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a co-op experience, you can pick and choose what class/character you can play as, like a Cook, a Dancer, or a fire mage. Or you know, your typical RPG job — a Luxomancer, who can "think outside the box".</p>
<p>But biggest draw here is the choose-your-own-adventure approach. Your choices matter in this game, with every decision shaping your adventure, leading to a lot of replayability. Perhaps with different friends each time!</p>
<p>For a brief rundown on Baladins, here are some details from its Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Choose your own adventure!</strong> Bring joy to the people of Gatherac with 1-4 players and let your collective choices shape the fate of this unusual world.</p>
<p><strong>- Be a hero!</strong> Play as one of five unique classes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and watch your character grow as the story unfolds!</p>
<p><strong>- Play at your own pace!</strong> The story of the Baladins can be played in short sessions over the course of the whole campaign</p>
<p><strong>- Encounter a dragon!</strong> It wouldn’t be a fantasy roleplaying game without one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes, this might be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/icymi-paper-mario-styled-rpg-escape-from-ever-after-has-launched-on-switch">the second RPG of the day</a> with a <em>very</em> <strong>Paper Mario</strong>-like aesthetic, but Baladins is much different, as you've likely gathered.</p>
<p>The game launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866320/Baladins/">Steam</a> back in May 2024, and it sits on a Very Positive rating after 116 reviews — hopefully, this console release will bring the whimsical adventure to more people's attention.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/871307/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review-ps5-switch-xbox</link>
            <guid>1422859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a video game series goes on for a long time, it raises a question for newcomers: Just where is the best place to jump in? In the case of <em>Dragon Quest</em>, there are nearly a dozen mainline titles, not to mention copious spinoffs and ports that span four decades of history. Of late, though, publisher Square Enix has been releasing a number of remakes that serve as almost ideal entry points for beginners who are intimidated by all of that baggage. And the new <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> might just be the best so far.</p><p><em>DQVII</em> was a pivotal game for the series when it launched on the original PlayStation, as it was the first with 3D graphics. For a franchise that evolves at a slow, deliberate pace, that was a big deal. Maybe that’s why this isn’t the first time Square Enix has remade it; the game also launched on the Nintendo 3DS under the new subtitle <em>Fragments of the Forgotten Past</em>. <em>Reimagined</em> builds on the core experience with a number of quality-of-life tweaks — you can see enemies before battle starts, for instance, and the game gives you a “previously on” story update each time you start it up — along with revamped graphics that make the game world look like a series of cute-as-heck dioramas. It doesn’t quite approach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">the handcrafted charm of <em>Fantasian</em></a>, but it’s close.</p><p>That stuff is great and makes <em>Reimagined </em>feel like a thoroughly modern game. But what really makes it a great entry point for <em>Dragon Quest</em> beginners is the way it’s structured. For the most part, every <em>Dragon Quest </em>is a standalone experience that tells its own story, so narrative-wise there’s no real issue with jumping into the series with any specific number, including the seventh game. But what makes <em>DQVII</em> unique is how its premise turns it into a series of episodes that are much more digestible than one single, epic quest.</p><p>Unlike most <em>Dragon Quest</em> games, and most other fantasy RPGs for that matter, <em>DQVII</em> isn’t set in one huge world. Instead, the game opens on a tiny island, one where the residents believe it’s literally the only place in the world. Of course, that turns out to not exactly be the case, as other islands slowly start to appear and you, the plucky hero, are also able to piece together magical tablets that whisk you to faraway realms.</p><p><em>DQVII </em>still has the epic scope of a traditional RPG, but this structure — which has you exploring these new islands and locations one at a time — makes it easier to both play in bite-sized chunks and remember just what the heck is going on. There’s an overarching story, but because each area has its own distinct storyline, the game ends up feeling almost like a series of chapters you tackle individually. I never really found myself lost in the story — thanks in part to the recap feature — nor did I find myself lost in the world itself, unsure of where to go next. And the islands are all pretty delightful places to explore; one moment you’re investigating a strange ritual in a giant volcano, the next you’re visiting a farming village where everyone has been turned into an animal.</p><p>It’s the combination of visual refresh, streamlined quality-of-life features, and less-intimidating structure that makes <em>Reimagined</em> such a good entry point. It’s also not alone. <em>Dragon Quest </em>has been incredibly popular in Japan since its inception, but has gradually grown its audience in the rest of the world. And over the last few years in particular, Square Enix has released a handful of titles that I consider to be great starter games. If you’re looking for something with a little bit more of a retro feel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the remake of <em>Dragon Quest III</em></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest">part of the publisher’s fascinating HD-2D line of games</a> — manages to strike the right blend of depth and approachability. It’s straightforward in a way that turns into something like RPG comfort food. And for something larger in scope, there’s always <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790204/dragon-quest-11-review-ps4-steam"><em>Dragon Quest XI</em></a>, the most recent mainline entry in the series, which takes the familiar<em> DQ </em>gameplay and bolts on high-end graphics and cutscenes that make it feel more like a modern epic.</p><p>But I think that <em>Reimagined</em> has those games beat when it comes to being welcoming. Every <em>DQ</em> game is charming, and every modern release has quality-of-life tweaks that make it more palatable compared to older RPGs. But the narrative structure of <em>DQVII </em>turns a huge adventure into a series of smaller, digestible stories, making it easier to play on your own terms. So if you’ve been wondering what the deal with blue slimes is, this is your best chance to find out.</p><p><sub>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined <em>launches on February 5th on the Switch, PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/871307/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review-ps5-switch-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-34-curved-gaming-monitor-falls-back-to-its-lowest-price-in-weeks-to-compete-with-samsung-odyssey-2000660670</link>
            <guid>1422853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it comes to gaming monitors, you have an overwhelming amount of options to pick from and specs to consider. Not just deciding on a brands, but also size, resolution, refresh rate—all of these factors come into play when finding what’s best for you and your budget. Though there’s one detail that’s more important than the others. How <em>curved&nbsp;</em>is it? If you’ve never worked with a curved monitor, it may just sound like a cheap gimmick, but you couldn’t be more wrong. Asus happens to have one of its curved monitors on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">The 34-inch VG34VQL1B TUF curved gaming monitor has seen a price drop at Amazon, coming down from $369 to just $289</a>. That 22% discount adds up to you being able to save a whole $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="472">Fully Immersive Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="472">A curved monitor is really something you need to experience firsthand to fully appreciate its advantages. The Asus 34-inch monitor features a 1,500R curvature designed to mirror the natural curve of human vision and how we perceive our surroundings. When placed at the optimal viewing distance, this curvature delivers a level of immersion that flat monitors simply can’t replicate, filling your peripheral with what’s happening on screen.</p>
<p data-start="474" data-end="1149">The Asus curved gaming monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz through its two DisplayPort 1.4 connections and two HDMI 2.0 ports, while also offering compatibility with AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA GeForce Adaptive-Sync to eliminate screen tearing. With a rapid 1ms response time and a QHD 1440p resolution, the display provides sharp, smooth visuals that are well suited for a 34-inch screen. Color performance is impressive for its price range, and the variety of available ports makes it an excellent choice for both PC and console gamers.</p>


<p data-start="1151" data-end="1391" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The display is mounted on a stand that allows for both height and tilt adjustments. This enables users to fine-tune the viewing position for maximum comfort, making it easier to enjoy longer and more extended gaming sessions without strain.</p>
<p>As a little bonus, Asus has generously thrown in a 3-month license for Adobe Creative Cloud. This software suite comes with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and After Effects. Normally, you’d be paying in the ballpark of $70 per month for an Adobe subscription, so you can see this as a $210 value included for absolutely free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">If this is something you happened to already be planning on subscribing to and now you don’t have to pay, you can think of it as this monitor only costing you $79.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New content continues to come thick and fast in Fortnite, which always leads to discussions about when the next major update is on the horizon, and v39.40 is right around the corner.</p>



<p>2026 has already gotten off to a flying start for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth, with major collabs with the likes of South Park and The Office, and Epic Games is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Fortnite v39.40 is due to arrive this week, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on when it drops and an overview of the content set to be added.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-fortnite-update">When is The Next Fortnite Update?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Teaser. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s next update is set to arrive on Thursday, February 5, with Epic Games deploying v39.40 into the fold.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games has settled into a fairly regular update schedule for Fortnite, with major updates and downtime coming every two to three weeks. With the last update occurring on January 22, it’s time for a new update.</p>



<p>This won’t be the final update of Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, however, as it’s likely there is at least one more update midway through the month before the new season kicks off in early March.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-v39-40">What’s Coming in Fortnite v39.40?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite v39.40 is packed full of major collabs, including a brand new Fortnite Festival season.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> is expected to feature Chappel Roan as the headline act, with teasers for her addition already appearing in the game and being uncovered in datamines.</p>



<p>It’s not just Fortnite Festival set to star, however, as Epic Games has already teased a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-teases-brand-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big crossover with Honkai Star Rail</a>, which is expected to arrive in the update, along with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter cosmetics, including a Jinu skin and Derp as a Sidekick.</p>



<p>The update will also see the end of the South Park collab and the departure of the Born in Chaos Mini Pass, so there are only a few more days left to claim all the rewards.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will also be some bug fixes and adjustments, as is customary with Fortnite patches, but the general gameplay won’t be overhauled significantly.</p>

<p>When it comes to breaking boundaries in video games, there are few who do it better than Goichi “Suda51” Suda. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> is his studio’s first new concept in over five years, and it’s finally almost here.</p>

"I did all the writing, and then the script went off sort of into the abyss, and I didn't hear anything for a while. Then I found out that it was going to shoot in a week. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They actually hadn't really done any casting. They were just going to use this actor who's based in Sweden, who was perfectly good, but I was like, 'This is going to be John Helldiver!' (I didn't know that would be his name at the time). We can't just get someone who's good! Like, we need to get the funniest person we can possibly find!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the initial audition, you read for what you can as an actor, and you get excited about so many things," added Thomas, admitting: "But this in particular, as soon as I read it, I was like, ahh, I really, really, <em>really</em> want to do this." So, with very little notice, he recorded a quick audition tape and sent it off. The video includes Thomas' audition and even though his portrayal is a little less amusing than we've come to expect, there's no doubting that it's our John Helldiver. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Within a couple days, I had gotten self tapes from Craig Lee Thomas, who plays John Helldiver," Nickel explained. "He's <em>perfect</em>. I love that man. He's so good!" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2l2g6H2ekc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>15-minute featurette</u></a> on YouTube, complete with insights into the recording and mocap process, and some thoughts from the director of the opening cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2's next Warbond 'Siege Breakers' will release tomorrow, February 3.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f</a> was one of last year's biggest surprises and marked a return to form for the veteran horror game franchise (if we don't count the SH2 remake). With a strong cast of characters, a 1960s Japan setting, and a dense atmosphere, it made an impression on veterans and newcomers alike. Now, two members of the main cast have been made ambassadors of the city that inspired the game's rural village.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-actors-appointed-tourism-ambassadors-for-japanese-city-that-inspired-the-game">IGN</a>, we've learned about the surprising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fZn1IovXDYw">YouTube short</a> posted on 2nd February by Takeshi Masago and Tamami Hiraoka, who played Hinako's (the protagonist) father and mother respectively. At first, fans thought they had a serious announcement to make given the video's initial tone, but it all ends with excitement and screaming as they reveal they've been made tourism ambassadors for Gero City in Japan's Gifu Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Kanayama-cho area, filled with "narrow alleyways and old houses" that instantly look familiar, served as the main inspiration for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s fictional Ebisugaoka village. Here's an image of the real-life location:</p>
<figure>

<p>The wholesome video also serves as the culmination of an ongoing saga that had many of the viewers following the pair of actors' clips together wishing they were married in real life (and hopefully in a healthier relationship than in the game). Many thought for a second they were getting married for real, but they're keeping things professional, so calm down.</p><p>Masago has also been promoting Gero City for a while now, <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?s=20">wine brewery included</a>. There's even Silent Hill f themed sake and chocolates now, with the first batch selling out instantly. It's yet another example of a Japan-set mainstream video game bringing lots of attention to certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, Tsushima Island got a massive boost to tourism following the release of Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> too. That also led to the game's lead devs <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island">becoming permanent tourism ambassadors of the city</a>.</p>

			<p>Remember that sense of adventure you had as a child, eager to explore the world around you? Imagine how much brighter that would burn if your island was the only one in existence. Your father, a renowned sailor, has sailed the seas and found nothing but pilchards as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>So starts Dragon Quest VII Reimagined.

<p>While such grandiose stories are now the hallmark of JRPGs, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better originator of this trope than the Dragon Quest series. This entry, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, is a complete rebuild of the original game released in 2000, reimagined for today’s era. It keeps the overarching narrative, but modernises pretty much everything else, from the visual styling, to the battle systems and the smaller elements of the story. Not only is this the best looking Dragon Quest game, it’s easily the most approachable Dragon Quest game to date.</p>

<p>First the graphics: at first glance, I must admit I was a little taken aback. I didn’t play the original or the 2013 3DS remake, so I watched the trailer wondering who this guy with a head the size of Lord Farquaad’s is &nbsp;– you can’t un-see it, sorry. And when the game started, your first companion was about as grating as Hermione Granger in the first Harry Potter film. The first few hours with them were slow, but after spending a little time with the game, these characters become endearing. Maribel is still vaguely annoying, but she’s part of the gang and clearly a good friend to the protagonist.</p>

<p>These characters (and the monsters they face) are really brought to life in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Their appearance is the result of painstaking work, creating and then scanning real-life dolls into the game to create something that looks incredibly real, and it combines beautifully with a diorama style to the environments. It is so effective that it sets a new high-water mark for modern remakes. If you don’t want to go the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII route with ultra HD graphics</a>, this is almost certainly the way to go.</p>
<p>As to the gameplay, we are looking at something pretty formulaic. Distilled down, you go out searching for stone fragments. Collect a set and you can go back in time to right a wrong in a village filled with amusingly caricatured Irish/French/Arabic/English people. Once that’s sorted, you go back to the present to visit the island and collect more stone fragments.</p>
<p>Being formulaic doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad. The locations you visit are varied and the events within them are unique. Sure, your characters aren’t quick on the uptake, and the puzzles laid before them aren’t overly difficult, but on the whole the gameplay is very engaging. I never felt bored playing this game and I enjoyed seeing what treasures each new island held.</p>

<p>This is where the modernisation really comes to the fore. Gone are the days of surprise encounters — as with the 3DS version, enemies walk around the overworld map and dungeons, and you can avoid them or gain a sneak attack if you’re diligent. The turn-based gameplay is interesting, with quality-of-life additions like auto-combat and instant kills for weak enemies really helping pick up the pace.</p>
<p>There’s also an overhauled vocation system, allowing you to moonlight as a second character class. You can now literally be a Warrior Priest or a Troubadour Martial Artist, which adds some interesting variety to combat. There’s also a powerful limit-break-esque system which can really turn the tide of battle.</p>
<p>And then there are the most granular difficulty settings I’ve ever seen. I played on normal difficulty, but in the interest of getting through the story before launch, turned on the ability to automatically heal after each battle. The ability to fine-tune the difficulty to your taste and needs really does meet the team’s goal of making this a game for everyone.</p>

<p>There’s a bevy of other changes that have been made to tighten up the pace and improve gameplay, but pacing is still a bit of an issue. Slow start aside, you’ll be dozens of hours in before you unlock your new vocations, meaning all that experience you could have been accumulating had been going to waste.</p>
<p>There are also issues in that you can tackle certain things in any order — I had Kiefer comment on the Demon King long before any of the NPCs uttered his name by way of exposition. Finally, we have the odd issue where (on the Switch) mashing B while talking to different people does different things — in a conversation with an important character you can turn down the opportunity to help them (bad), but with the priest asking if you intend to continue your adventure, B is the same as A. A truly minor issue, but something that caught our eye.</p>

<p>Ready to feel old? It’s been about 13 years since the launch of the 3DS remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/dragon_quest_vii_fragments_of_the_forgotten_past">Dragon Quest VII</a>, which itself was released about 13 years after the original on the PSX. That means that it’s time for yet another remake of the storied classic, which has been dubbed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> this time around. This iteration goes a bit farther than its 3DS predecessor in making various nips and tucks that update the game for a new generation, and I’m pleased to report that this feels like the most enjoyable version of Dragon Quest VII yet.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161678/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The narrative places you in the role of a quiet boy living a peaceful life who believes there's more to the world beyond his small island home. He’s joined in this belief by the adventurous Prince Kiefer and the Mayor’s daughter, Maribel, and it isn’t long until this band of kids discover a mysterious shrine in which ancient stone tablets allow them to travel to various places in the past.</p>
<p>The plot then takes an almost anthological approach, where you and your party jump back in time to various islands and play out small and largely self-contained subplots on each one, such as saving a town that’s been overrun by robots or uncovering the mystery of a village in which everyone has been turned into animals. After resolving the conflict for that island, it magically reappears in the ocean in the present and you can visit to see how your actions led to a changed future.</p>
<p>It’s not a very character-driven plot like you may find in a grander adventure like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_definitive_edition">Xenoblade</a>, but what the story lacks in deep characterisation, it more than makes up for in its <em>cosiness</em>. Despite some occasionally dark themes, this is the sort of light, airy, and chipper experience that keeps you invested due to how consistently it maintains its positive atmosphere. As you work through these cute and uplifting stories of friendship and courage, you feel more connected to the places you’re uncovering, which leads to a much more emotional experience later on when the story starts to come together into one coherent strand.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161696/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main selling points for this reimagining is the 'streamlining' of content, and while I’m sure this may be divisive among some fans, I’d say the changes made here were largely for the better. The original game was infamously bloated, most notably with it taking around two hours from the start of the game before you even enter your first combat scenario, and this reimagining has cut out a lot of the extraneous dialogue and backtracking that added so much padding. Fortunately, these cuts were made tastefully and led to an overall tighter game—what's lost in raw detail and content is made up for by an adventure that <em>moves</em> where the original tended to drag.</p>
<p>World exploration also tends to proceed at a thrilling pace, mostly due to the elimination of random battles that’s carried over from the 3DS remake. Rather than getting jumped every few steps, enemies now roam the map freely and can be deftly avoided if you’d rather just pass through an area. If their level is far enough below yours, they’ll even run away from <em>you</em> and swiping with your sword will net you the rewards you’d get from a battle without the hassle of jumping to the combat screen.</p>
<p>Couple this with nice quality of life features like fast travel and the Nose for Treasure skill, and it’s never been easier for completionists to rinse each area of every hidden chest and Mini Medal.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161680/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you happen to come across a foe who’s closer to your level, battles follows the same bog-standard turn-based combat the franchise has always been known for, with you utilising an active party of up to four members to bash in some Slimes. Though the simple approach may feel a bit quaint compared to more mechanically advanced combat systems, like the Boost/Break system in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> or the Press Turn system in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_v_vengeance">Shin Megami Tensei</a>, that doesn’t mean that it isn’t still engaging.</p>
<p>Each character gradually amasses a swath of diverse skills and spells to bolster their role in the fight, and if you don’t want to get caught up with navigating all the menus, there are a variety of competent auto-battle macros you can set that do a great job handling just about any trash mob battles.</p>
<p>Similar to the Pep Powers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_xi_s_echoes_of_an_elusive_age_-_definitive_edition">Dragon Quest XI</a>, party members can now occasionally get ‘Worked Up’ after they’ve dealt and received enough damage. These powerful short-term buffs are connected to the character’s vocation (more on that in a bit) and can do things like block all damage for a turn or significantly increase damage output. They aren’t necessarily an ‘instant win’ button, but triggering one can certainly turn the tide of a battle that's slowly getting away from you. I also appreciated how they’re randomly triggered in the majority of cases, which keeps them from being an easy crutch to lean on and ensures they act more as a nice X factor that can suddenly mix up a battle.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161683/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Vocations are the class system used in DQVII and they follow the progression for a standard jobs system—each one is levelled separately from the character it’s equipped to, and that character unlocks newer skills and abilities as they move up in vocation ranks. As you progress through the world and explore, you slowly unlock more vocations, the more powerful of which require a character to master some prerequisite vocations before granting them access to the powerful stat buffs and abilities they come with.</p>
<p>For this remake, vocations have also gotten a nice freshening up to make them more compelling. Not only are there new vocations added, but you can now unlock the ability to 'Moonlight', which means you can add a second vocation to a character to further alter their stats and available abilities. It doesn’t quite match the heights of the cross-classing madness found in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> or Octopath Traveler games, but it <em>is</em> another step in that direction and makes party building a much more interesting endeavour as you explore different builds and skill mixes.</p>

<p>In a massive step up from the pixel art graphics of the original and the somewhat chunky models of the 3DS remake, the visuals have been updated to reflect a more photorealistic toy-like atmosphere. Square actually made small handmade dolls of the various party members and scanned them in for extra detail, and every frame looks as if you're viewing a carefully crafted diorama.</p>
<p>This looks especially great on Switch 2, where an unbroken 60fps and at least 1080p resolution present everything with sharp detail and smooth motion. I’d go so far as to say that this is the best-looking Dragon Quest game Square Enix has ever produced, surpassing its previous efforts in the original release of Dragon Quest XI via its seamless blend of photorealism with Akira Toriyama’s cartoonish art style.</p>
<p>The soundtrack also got a makeover here, with all the music being re-recorded and treated with new orchestral arrangements that capture the essence of the original while introducing some new elements. These arrangements all perfectly reflect the whimsical and adventurous spirit that the Dragon Quest franchise is known for, keeping the atmosphere playful while occasionally taking things into a more serious realm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined proves to be a strong revisit of a classic, trimming the fat and including welcome additions to make for a magical experience that no fan of classic JRPGs will want to miss. Though I’m hesitant to call this the 'definitive' version of the game, given the content cuts, I would certainly say it’s the most <em>fun</em> version yet. Combine the more engaging pace of the narrative with some nice gameplay updates like moonlighting and those gorgeous visuals, and it’s tough to argue that the previous versions are more enjoyable.</p>
<p>At any rate, I’d highly suggest you pick this up if you’re looking for another high-quality, old-school JRPG for your collection; Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined may not be all that innovative, but it absolutely nails its gameplay and aesthetics.</p></section>

			<p>Ask JRPG veterans to name the top ten titles in the genre and you'll routinely hear one title being namedropped near the top of that list: <strong><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-vii-fragments-of-the-forgotten-past/">Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>. It was an experimental and moody title, focused around an opening act that sets the tone for the adventure with three young children learning about the sole island left in the world and why the world has been trapped away for hours before hearing that iconic battle theme. Now the second time that this adventure has been remade, is <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> more of the same with a brand new look, or has Square-Enix set off to redefine what the standards of being a Japanese Role-Playing Game should be?</p>



<p>In both the original PSX version and 3DS remake of Dragon Quest VII, it was (in)famous for having one of the longest introduction sequences before players even set foot in their first battle, often taking players nearly three hours before they bump into their first Slime. In Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, that prologue has been massively streamlined, getting players acclimated to the single island, picking up a few map shards here and there, and making their first trip through the Shrine of Mysteries to the world of the past, in less than half that. It was a properly bold move in the original game to spend so much time on just building up the worlds and setting up the vibes for the adventure that it would be impossible to replicate in this day and age of players wanting instant gratification. Because of this, the sense of being the lone island left in the world loses some of its impact and instead feels like the intro has been rushed to keep the focus of ADHD-raddled gamers.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Confidence-Man-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The core loop for much of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined remains the same from the original game: acquire enough map shards to unlock a portal to the past, solve whatever great calamity struck that island before it was locked away, venture forth to the same island in the present and see the impact of your actions, and pick up enough shards to unlock the next island map. Rinse and repeat, with novel deviations here and there along your journey to slay <strong>Orgodemir.</strong> This formula takes a huge turn during the game’s third and final act, resulting in a stark change in setting and ability to freely explore the world, which stands out as one of Dragon Quest’s best chapters in the entire series. While the adventure is massively funneled down from feeling like an open-world adventure to one where players are once again on rails for much of the journey, it’s still an enjoyable ride to the finish line, even if much of the challenge has been tapered off along the way.</p>



<p>No surprises to anyone who’s played the series before: combat is your standard Dragon Quest turn-based affair here. Your party of four heroes ventures onto the battlefield in a row, and players pick their actions individually while rounds play out with player and enemy alternating attacks based on the speediest of the bunch. Every individual attack and spell is animated uniquely, giving each battle a visual flourish that is sometimes lost in JRPG’s. While there are options to speed up battle, there isn’t an option to skip these animations, so you’ll be hearing a lot of that iconic spell jingle each time Maribel’s turn comes up.&nbsp;The occasional guest character will venture alongside the party of four, giving players some much-needed support or an extra attack from time to time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Body-Slam-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the best-looking entry in the long-running JRPG series, and it’s no wonder why. Every room that the party ventures into looks like a miniature diorama, taking inspiration from Mistwalker’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fantasian/">Fantasian</a>, with the added benefit of being able to rotate the view rather than being limited to a fixed camera angle. It’s the little attention to detail that makes Eden feel properly lived in: uneven stacks of wooden bowls in a restaurant sink, footprints left behind in the sand when running through the corridors of a village in the middle of a desert. There’s such a rustic charm to the world that makes Dragon Quest VII Reimagined feel like a world that’s been lived in for hundreds of years.</p>



<p>On the character front, the same attention to detail is twofold. While your standard NPCs all suffer from the signature blank stare that <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>’s background characters were known for, characters more integral to the story are given much more interesting presentation; think Yakuza’s cadre of copy-and-pasted denizens, but on a far more intimate scale. Compare that to the focus given to the half-dozen party members that the Hero brings along for an adventure to save the world. Each of these heroes looks like a toy brought to life with some of the finest character modeling this side of a Kojima Productions game. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Square-Enix license out the heck of this game with collectible figurines of Ruff and his mother wolf looking identical to his in-game counterpart. While you lose some of that next-gen definition, like hair physics, the realistic cloth modeling gives each hero's attire that stands out against the weathered environments.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Secret-Meeting-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>On the topic of attire, that’s one of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined’s biggest drawbacks. In the original releases, each vocation bestowed upon the hero a unique costume that completely changed their appearance based on their current job. While I get that modeling twenty-two different costumes for each hero would be quite the undertaking, leaving the only amount of character customization to the weapons they bring into battle is quite the choice. Playing the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined demo and loading a save into the full game rewards Maribel with the Day Off Dress, a marigold-hued nightgown, which remains the only actual ensemble that players can unlock during regular play, at least without the cost of real money. Square-Enix has offered a few different bundles for the <a href="http://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA17730_00-DQ7RE0000000DE00">digital edition of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> that give the band of heroes costumes based on the roster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-return-of-the-luminary/">Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a> (with Maribel once again getting an additional costume above everyone else).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even worse than losing vocation liveries is the removal of any real difficulty from Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. What remains one of the longest entries in the series has also been neutered down into one of its simplest and easiest to complete. Any amount of friction and challenge has been sanded down and trimmed away in an attempt to streamline this entry and make it more accessible for a new generation of JRPG fans. In the original, it was often a puzzle to figure out which age and location might hold enough map shards needed to create a portal to another island; here, handholding and constant reminders from the caretaker of the <strong>Shrine of Mysteries</strong> clue the player in on where to go next to uncover a critical key item. <strong>Party Chat</strong>, by way of the Circle Button, offers up a brief quip from a party member clueing the player in on where to head off to next.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Butty-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Players can customize their challenge through a variety of sliders, ranging from the amount of experience earned to both the damage dealt to and received from enemies, and even being able to restore the party’s HP after every encounter. All in all, these are just numerical tweaks and don’t give enemies new attacks or tactics to contend with, and players can always use the Auto Battle feature to breeze through repeated encounters and grind with ease. Symbol encounters on the overworld let players see enemies rather than random encounters, and swinging your sword at them will either result in taking the initiative in combat or, if the Hero’s party outlevels that of the enemy forces, will kill them outright, netting the player a fraction of the experience and gold they’d otherwise entail. For grinding out the last few levels of every vocation, I’m guilty of taking full advantage of that and mercilessly slaying slimes for a few vocation proficiency points at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <strong>Vocation</strong> system in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined has always been intended to allow players to build out the party of their dreams, eschewing archetypes for a given character and instead letting them become any class of their choosing. Want your primary Hero to be the party’s healer while Maribel plays the role of Pirate? That’s only a quick call away to your career coach at Alltrades Abbey through a key item that lets you freely change up your given job whenever you like (no more having to wait until you unlock Sage to get that feature). Towards the back half of your adventure, players will also unlock the ability to <strong>Moonlight </strong>as a second class, gaining both the statistical increases and skills of that second class. While on paper this lends itself to being more flexible and having unique party setups for every player, in practice, this results in every character maining the <strong>Hero</strong> vocation and then Moonlighting as either a <strong>Champion</strong> or <strong>Druid</strong>, depending on whether you prefer to have a physical attacker or magical supporter. Gone are the Monster vocations (Monster Hearts are instead equippable accessories rather than brand new classes) and the ability to carry over any skill/spell from the Intermediate and Advanced vocations if you aren’t currently adventuring as that given class.</p>

<p>What was once an 80-100 hours long adventure on the conservative side can now be finished in roughly half that, coming in at around 50-60 hours for your average playthrough, depending on your appetite for grinding out vocation levels or mini medal hunting. Padding that time are the necessary trophies to collect every mini medal, and as a result, every item in the compendium. Many of the rarest items in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined are found in <strong>Lucky Panel</strong>, the sole minigame of Pilgrim’s Rest, which once hosted a bevvy of other casino games in the original game. Your Match Two skills will be put to the test for hours on end as you try to match enough panels to unlock rare gear, which, if you wait until the postgame to unlock the remainder of these items, will easily be outclassed by the other weapons and gear players might pick up by way of the Coliseum or other challenging side quests. I may be bitter about the time I had to waste to unlock every single item, but my actual playtime was ballooned up to almost 90 hours because of the sheer amount of Lucky Panel I had to play through just to acquire less than ten unique items from that particular minigame.</p>

<p>If nothing else, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is simply the best-looking entry in the three-decade-old role-playing series by a long shot. While any amount of friction and challenge has been smoothed out to barely more than a splinter’s prick, this time-traveling adventure is perfect for players who want to dip their toes into the JRPG series without having to worry about superfluous calendar deadlines in the Persona series or reaction-based gimmicks in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. My final score is representative of how the title respected my time and offered up next to no challenge in the course of normal gameplay, and it goes without saying that the amount of care and detail put into the presentation far exceeds the listed score.</p>

					<h2>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>A guided experience from beginning to end, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined does away with any sense of exploration and challenge by holding the player's hand whether they want the guidance or not. What could be the most beautiful rendition of the greatest entry in the Dragon Quest series is instead Reimagined to be the beginner's first JRPG.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Tried-and-true JRPG combat at its finest
</li><li>A slow burn that quickly picks up steam, streamlining the opening hours but losing some of the narrative genius at the same time
</li><li>A time traveling narrative about putting the world back together, one island at a time
</li><li>Moonlighting as a second Vocation unlocks new builds not possible in earlier versions
</li><li>The world comest to life as a realistic diorama and some of the best looking character models to date
</li><li>Mini Medal checklist tells players where to find them, reducing the need to scour the world thrice over breaking every barrel or falling down every well
</li><li>Maribel sticks around longer than one might remember</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Kiefer's chin
</li><li>Any sense of exploration and wonder is reined in by constant handholding and guidance
</li><li>No friction or challenge to combat
</li><li>No class-based costumes (or costume changes in general outside of DLC and demo rewards)
</li><li>Removal of casino minigames and Monster classes
</li><li>Hours of time wasted with Lucky Panel if you want to complete the Item Compendium
</li><li>Kiefer's return spoiled by announcement trailers (and remains just a side character only usable in the final dungeon)</li>						</ul>

            <guid>1422808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <strong>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</strong> forever changed the first-person shooter landscape and the <strong>Call of Duty</strong> franchise, the world of FPS games was dominated by classic World War I and World War II-era shooters. Of course, we still <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-wwii-strategic-squad-shooter-now-available-on-pc/">get historic shooters</a>, but it's developer <strong>Hoothanes</strong> and publisher <strong>4Divinity's</strong> upcoming WWII-era shooter, <strong>The Defiant</strong>, that has FPS feeling those OG COD and even <strong>Medal of Honor</strong> vibes.</p>



<p>The Defiant is an upcoming <strong>single-player first-person shooter</strong> set during WWII, but not from an angle we've commonly seen before. You'll play as Chinese soldiers fighting in China's War of Resistance against Japan, in this cinematic narrative-driven story. It'll be coming to PC and consoles, and according to more than a few players checking out a recently debuted gameplay trailer, this is "<em>What Call of Duty used to be like</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Defiant: Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/29rGPx5NjaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For now, we don't have a ton of details on the game's story, with the description from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELjOzlCslNw">a different gameplay video </a>posted on developer Hoothane's channel adding that The Defiant will deliver "<em>battlefield immersion, tactical gunplay, gritty realism, and character-driven storytelling</em>." The comments on that video, like the ones shared under the trailer above hosted on IGN's channel, all similarly call out how much the game presents as an FPS for fans of the OG COD and Medal of Honor games.</p>



<p>Of course, whether it actually achieves at bringing players back to those kinds of gameplay experiences, with all of the improvements to graphical and gameplay fidelity afforded by modern hardware, is a different question. But it is encouraging for fans of that era of shooters to see something new, seemingly made for them.</p>



<p>Games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-team17-future-games-show-gamescom-2025/">Hell Let Loose</a></strong> and upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/yarnhub-studios-brass-rain-debut-gameplay-trailer-wwi-f2p/">Brass Rain</a></strong> may do a solid job at offering a multiplayer setting for historical shooters, but if The Defiant can deliver on its storytelling and gameplay, it might revitalize excitement around FPS that want to give players something more than a game that's trying to pull them in for hundreds of hours over the course of many years with live service content. Hopefully, we'll have a clearer release window for its arrival on PC and consoles soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Review - One Fragment After Another]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-review</link>
            <guid>1422805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Dragon Quest</em> series is on a bit of a roll lately, clearly laying the ground for the eventual release of <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> - whenever that decides to come out of hiding again. But before all that, Square Enix has been hard at work offering up remakes to several of the older games in the series.</p><p>First, we had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I and II</em></a> released last year. Now things are skipping ahead a bit, with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> heading the lineup.</p><p>Unlike its contemporaries, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is exactly that. It’s shed the more 2D look of the original PlayStation version and opted for a 3D diorama art direction. What this means is everything exists in a 3D environment - including the player characters.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260110230511.jpg?itok=y0p_cx6Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260110230511.jpg?itok=50n2tPS7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>This isn’t even the first time <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> was redone in 3D. A 3DS remake had its own visual style, but <em>Reimagined</em> goes beyond that. With such a departure from both that and the original, I suppose the question at large is: does it work? And does it vibe with the other recent remakes?</p><p>At first glance, it’s easy to be wary - after all, Square Enix spent a lot of time getting people used to the HD 2D style. That doesn’t mean their 3D efforts have gone astray, however.</p><p>Digging into <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is like visiting an old friend I never got the chance to actually meet. That is to say, as someone who didn’t play the original, all of this was going to be delightfully fresh and without the burden of nostalgia goggles.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111233757.jpg?itok=-WVjVWDD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111233757.jpg?itok=QL_Yl391 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>That said, it’s clear right away that <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is a love letter to the style of RPGs we got out of the PlayStation era.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> follows the series’ traditional silent protagonist as he makes his way as a young boy in the fishing town of Pilchard Bay, located on the world’s one and only island. After a short introduction to his family and his father’s discovery of a mysterious looking stone fragment, he meets up with his childhood friend Kiefer, who decides to do a little exploring.</p><p>The pair comes across a mysterious shrine and is convinced there’s something else out there. The fragments they’ve obtained seem to feature some sort of map, and soon enough, they’re able to gather enough that leads them to a new island in an unfamiliar world.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112165931.jpg?itok=mFx8OaKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112165931.jpg?itok=DcyVTvS4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>As it turns out, things aren’t what they seem, and it’s clear there’s a higher power at play here. These fragments of the past, as it is soon discovered, paint the picture of lands that were obscured for many years. The party at hand helps the people in need, vanquishes the foe behind it all, and then returns to the present, where it turns out that same island has just appeared in their own time.</p><p>This is just one of many cases, and the protagonist, along with Kiefer and their friend Maribel, will have to continue to collect fragments to uncover even more lost islands. Of course, they eventually discover even bigger forces at play as the party bulks up, but the meat of the story takes place in each of these island vignettes.</p><p>That is to say, while yes, there is an overarching plot, I found the individual quests held most of the emotional weight and narrative meat of the story. Tales of a whole village turned to stone, and tales of an island doomed to the flood, are just some examples out of many that fly in the face of a larger, looming darkness.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112183353.jpg?itok=vDjWaGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112183353.jpg?itok=4NekfaoR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Even though the time spent on each island isn’t particularly long, the characters in each of these stories have plenty of heart. <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>’s core party is fairly stock standard, but that isn’t a bad thing when they become a vehicle to witness these other stories.</p><p>The biggest draw for me with the cast was how different they all were from each other. There’s the young protagonist, but Kiefer is an adventurous prince, Maribel is the fierce childhood friend, Ruff is a feral young boy with a wolf companion, and later on, characters like Aishe and Mervyn round out those with different worldly experiences.</p><p>This becomes especially apparent when taking them into battle. <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> operates on a traditional turn-based system. That is to say that each party member and enemy takes turns making their move.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111223250.jpg?itok=SrZTZVyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111223250.jpg?itok=YxAip_5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It’s all very much the classic turn-based battles with some additional twists. Firstly, battles can be initiated by approaching visible enemies on the field. Then, once in battle, tactics can be set to ease the flow of each turn. Characters can also fight using the CPU with the auto battle option.</p><p>On top of this, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> offers a full job system - that is characters have the ability to equip not just one, but two vocations with the Moonlighting system. What this does is offer up different abilities and stats that sort of combine with each other, and jobs can be swapped out on the regular to mix up gameplay.</p><p>For example, I found equipping Maribel with both Sage and Mage vocations doubled up her magic for powerful results. The same with focusing the protagonist as both a Fisherman and a Martial Artist. Truly, the combinations are endless, and it’s worth tinkering with different builds for each character.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111220650.jpg?itok=LBONewhE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111220650.jpg?itok=ItEJ49sP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Each job also allows for a specific Let Loose mechanic when characters become worked up. These special attacks can hit pretty hard and can offer a boost to the party when needed, which is why the ability to swap jobs whenever possible is so special.</p><p>Outside of battle, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> involves a lot of collecting. There’s a lot of going around and exploring for the fragments needed for the main scenario, but also side items like medals and gear, and along the way, there are environmental puzzles and the Lucky Panel minigame that involves a visual matching game and a battle arena.</p><p>While there’s not a lot of exterior content, there’s also some additional dungeons that provide more of a challenge in the late game, and being able to go back through after the main story is finished is certainly a plus. It’s helpful too for snagging any missed fragments - after a point, I did feel like I was more set on getting to the end with the copious amount of backtracking and pacing problems throughout the same areas involved.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112000059.jpg?itok=PiLmmgyG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112000059.jpg?itok=fa49wla8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>But despite these hangups, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is delightful in its visual presentation. With the 3D dioramas and character models in play, there’s a very specific charm that hasn’t quite been done in the series yet. Combined with the classic score done up for the modern age, the presentation leaves little to desire.</p><p>All said, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is a solid outing in every sense of the word. If you’ve never played the original, like me, there are hours to dig into. If you’re a returning player, the additions to the job system might be the big thing that catches your eye.</p><p>Either way, and despite some tedium, Square Enix has done a solid job bringing <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> into the modern age. I’ll be very curious to see where the series goes next.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor reviewed <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </strong>on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-apple-pencil-alternative-drops-43-to-a-new-record-low-compatible-with-ipad-pro-and-ipad-mini-2000664837</link>
            <guid>1422799</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets make it incredibly easy to stay productive and entertained on the go. If you mainly use yours for creative tasks or note-taking, you can take the experience even further by investing in a Stylus Pen.</p>
<p>Apple has its own Pencil, but like most products from the brand, these don’t come in cheap, with the latest options sitting over $100. If you’re not keen on spending that much, but still want to enjoy the features and precision, there are plenty of third-party options around, available for way less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/">Now is a great time to pick one, as we just spotted the Jamjake Stylus Pen going at a 43% discount at Amazon, which brings its price down to just $17.</a> This offer applies to the white option. Several other colors are discounted too, but the prices may vary.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Accuracy and Higher Precision</h2>
<p>This stylus pen features a 1.5mm pen tip that can easily replace your finger to execute finer instructions. You’ll enjoy higher sensitivity, an accurate signal, and a more comfortable hold, along with palm rejection technology that lets you place your hand on the screen while working. The pen offers a natural writing feeling and quick interaction with the screen, so you won’t have to press/drag it against your iPad to make work; just write or draw how you would in a regular notebook!</p>
<p>Compatibility is seriously impressive. The stylus plays nicely with iPad series 2018-2025, which includes models like the 13-inch M4 iPad Pro, 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd/4th/5th/6th), all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro, iPad Air (M3, M2, 5th, 4th, 3rd generation), iPad series 6th through 11th, iPad Mini 5th, and iPad Mini 6th gen. The models it doesn’t support include iPad Pro (1st and 2nd gen), the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, iPad series 1st through 5th, iPad Mini 1st through 4th gen, or iPhones. It’s best to double-check compatibility before you purchase the stylus to avoid issues later.</p>



<p>The pen magnetically clicks onto the side of your iPad for easy storage and quicker access. Activating the thing is quite straightforward; simply touch the cap button to get started. As for the battery life, one full charge gets you around up to 10 hours of usage, which is more than enough to go a full day without worrying about topping it up. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever. A quick 5-20 minute charge prepares it for the day.</p>
<p>Just note that the stylus pen does not come with a pen cap or a charging port cover. The manufacturer also suggests using a 5V2A power adapter to charge the product to maintain its efficiency.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for an easy way to take notes or sketch on your iPad, this stylus pen is a must-have. You can use it to write documents, doodle on the screen, paint, draw, navigate, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/">It typically sits at $30, which is already quite affordable considering all that the stylus offers, but Amazon is letting you pick it up for just $17 today.</a> It’s best to grab it as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting the offer to last long.</p>

According to the devs, the virus in question “does not destroy your computer,” but instead aims to disable or otherwise destroy certain aspects of </span><i><span>People Playground’s </span></i><span>functionality.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Users who have downloaded any mods from the game’s Workshop are being urged to wipe their entire mod lists, even if they didn’t download the malicious mod in question. This is because the add-on “replaces [mods] with itself,” and has reportedly supplanted several other mods in </span><i><span>People Playground</span></i><span>’s </span><span>workshop.</span></p>

 <p><span>The malicious mod also somehow made its way into </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qtdmac/comment/o326x09/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the top-rated section</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>People Playground</span></i><span>’s</span><span> workshop, which may explain how it spread to so many users in such a short space of time, considering the mod was uploaded to the Steam Workshop on January 30.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, unfortunately, isn’t the first time that a Steam Workshop mod has infected users’ games. In February 2022, several mods for </span><i><span>Cities: Skylines</span></i><span> were removed from the Steam Workshop following reports that they contained </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-mods-mod-bitcoin-virus-steam-pc-trojan-1848536798"><span>keyloggers and bitcoin mining software</span></a><span>. In December 2023, the popular Workshop mod </span><i><span>Downfall </span></i><span>for </span><i><span>Slay the Spire</span></i><span> was subject to a “security breach” that infected users’ </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/popular-slay-the-spire-mod-downfall-was-hijacked-to-spread-malware-through-steam"><span>machines with malware</span></a><span> that attempted to steal their passwords via their web browsers.</span></p>

<p>New content continues to come thick and fast in Marvel Rivals, with the release date for Season 6.5 now rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>The launch of Season 6 made waves with the long-awaited addition of Deadpool, but NetEase is not resting on their laurels and have plenty more up their sleeves in future drops.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 release date, start times, and what to expect, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-release">When Does Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big drop. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 kicks off on February 13, but the mid-season transition means you won’t need to rapidly grind through the Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>As is customary in the mid-seasdon update, the Season 6 Battle Pass will continue, but there will be new additions in Season 6.5, including new cosmetics and likely limited-time passes.</p>



<p>The slew of new content won’t be as big as was seen at the start of Season 6, however, with the next big drop instead coming at the start of Season 7 in May.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-start-times">Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The start time for Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 has not been confirmed, but previous updates suggest the season will kick off at 2 AM PT on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>That means a later start in morning for those elsewhere in the United States, though it will still be in the early hours, while those in Europe have to wait until mid-morning, and those down under must wait until th evening.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 start times in major regions across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Jan. 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-content">All Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Content</h2>



<p><strong>After Deadpool’s arrival at the start of Season 6, Season 6.5 is headlined by the arrival of Elsa Bloodstone as the latest playable character.</strong></p>



<p>New maps and new cosmetics are also set to be introduced, and there will likely be a Valentine’s Day collab introduced at the start of the season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals could also issue further hints towards additions coming in the Season 7 launch in March, adding to the speculation after a gallery card featured teases for Black Cat and White Fox.</p>

            <guid>1422748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker is designed to give you outdoor sound with reliable playback that isn’t affected by rain, sand, or contact with water or dirt. It’s a compact, waterproof, and dustproof IP68 Bluetooth speaker with 50W of output. The flotation system keeps the unit upright in water, maintaining an outward-facing orientation with the sound facing outward. This means you can throw it into a pool or lake, and it will continue to function. The Boom 3i gives you up to 16 hours of playback time, BassUp 2.0, and a removable strap, making it ideal for travel.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/">You can purchase the Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker on Amazon for $75, down from its normal price of $140, for a savings of $65 or 46%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A loud and capable portable speaker with plenty of power behind it</h2>
<p>The Boom 3i is designed for those who want to enjoy high-quality sound near water. By combining a fully waterproof design with a flotation feature that keeps the speakers pointed toward you, the unit maintains strong sound quality. The IP68 rating lets you submerge the unit and protects it against dust, reducing the likelihood of damage from saltwater, sand, or other debris found near the ocean. The rugged housing is also built to handle normal wear and tear, including drops.</p>
<p>Sound from the Boom 3i comes from a 50W amplifier, a BassUp 2.0 processor, and digital signal control that helps maintain clear voice reproduction and strong low-frequency response. Stereo playback creates a wider sound field and helps maintain a consistent tone even when you raise the volume in an open area.</p>



<p>The Boom 3i offers up to 16 hours of battery life per charge, letting you listen for extended periods without recharging. Bluetooth 5.3 gives you a strong wireless connection to mobile devices while using minimal power. Fast pairing makes it easy to connect additional devices to share playlists and control music, and True Wireless Stereo lets you pair two units to create a wider sound field and higher overall volume.</p>
<p>The companion app adds intelligent features beyond standard music playback. The Voice Amplifier turns the speaker into a portable loudspeaker for amplifying voice messages and announcements, and the Emergency Alarm plays a piercing alert tone to attract immediate attention. The app also includes Buzz Clean, which pushes excess water out of the speaker drivers after heavy exposure to water to help prevent distortion and reduced volume. You can also customize the equalizer settings and choose different listening modes.</p>
<p>Portability features include a water bottle-style design, a removable strap you can attach to backpacks or boat rails, and a size that’s easy to hold with one hand, making it simple to carry.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/"> At $75, the Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker</a> gives you high sound pressure levels, true waterproofing, long battery life, and smart app features at a much lower price than its usual $140 list price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006</link>
            <guid>1422742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ashes of Creation</em> is living up to its name. The fantasy MMORPG came to Steam in Early Access on December 11. Less than eight weeks later, its future is in complete limbo amid staff resignations and reported layoffs. The Intrepid Studios-made open-world game raised over $3.2 million on <a href="https://kotaku.com/kickstarter-survival-horror-pc-mystery-flesh-pit-1849829127">Kickstarter</a> back in 2017. Now its director claims that board control of the company has been stolen away from him and that those who seized it are trying to do unethical things.</p> <p>“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” director Steven Sharif wrote on Discord on January 31 (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGamesN</a></em>). “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <p>Sharif doesn’t get into what specific things the board was trying to do but said other senior staff resigned along with him and that the company is currently moving forward with mass layoffs. Intrepid is based in San Diego, California where companies must give notice before laying employees off, but the state’s database doesn’t yet show any updates for the studio. Still, the reports of sudden chaos were backed up by another former employee.</p> <p>Studio communications director Margaret Krohn recently posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that they’ve left the company as well. “I gave everything I had, and did my very best with what was within my power.” they wrote. “And I ask one last favor of you, please be kind to the developers, we are people who have families who have just lost our jobs after pouring our hearts and souls into <em>Ashes of Creation</em>.” The message continued, “As for how this all ended…I don’t really have the words. It wasn’t what I expected. But I’m holding onto the good because there was so much of it.”</p>

 <h2>A massive Kickstarter goes belly up</h2> <p><em>Ashes of Creation</em> was pitched back in 2017 as a <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-still-looking-for-an-mmo-that-feels-reminds-me-of-th-1824179891">factions-based MMO</a> that would eschew pay-to-win microtransactions. Backers who collectively contributed millions have now been waiting nearly a decade for launch. While it finally came to Steam Early Access in December, some backers are claiming that doesn’t count as a full 1.0 release and are demanding refunds instead. “Early bird backer,” wrote one of them. “Extremely disappointed with the behavior of this company. And yes, I will be pursuing a refund.” Another wrote, “Refund my $500 please.”</p>

 <p>Concerns about funding for the game have hounded its development since the original Kickstarter. At the time, Sharif suggested he was the main financial backer and that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> would need $30 million in total to ship as promised. He denied accusations that it was essentially a “vanity project” led by an inexperienced rich guy. “First and foremost I am an MMORPG gamer,” he <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2017/05/04/ashes-of-creations-steven-sharif-on-his-business-history-30m-funding-goal-and-pvp/">told <em>MassivelyOP</em></a> at the time. “I have been since I first sat down at a computer. I had the fortunate circumstance in life, to become wealthy through hard work at a young age. A couple years ago, I got very fed up with what was happening to a genre that I love. So I decided to put my money where my heart is and do something about it.”</p> <p>Now early players are getting very fed up with <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. The Discord is in a full-on panic and owners on Steam have been review-bombing the game. The user rating sits at an “overwhelmingly negative” 30 percent and players are predicting the MMO’s imminent cancelation. “Since<em> Ashes of Creation</em> will be shutting down soon, purchasing the game right now might be a bad idea,” reads one of the most recent Steam reviews. But Intrepid itself hasn’t confirmed what the actual plan is right now. Just last week it promised a developer update on February 13 to address recent complaints over the game’s biggest design and performance issues. ”</p>

 <p>“We know that some of you are frustrated right now. We feel that. You’ve been candid about the issues impacting your experience, and you deserve clarity and honesty in return,” a January 29 <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">blog post read</a>. “[The game’s setting of] Verra is still growing. We remain deeply committed to making it a world worthy of your time, your stories, and your belief.” It was signed “The <em>Ashes of Creation</em> Team,” whoever that still is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The third season of HBO's <em>The Last of Us</em> could be its last, despite showrunner <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/20/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-craig-mazin-says-theres-no-way-to-complete-this-narrative">Craig Mazin alluding to needing at least four seasons</a> to wrap up the story last year. That's according to HBO CEO and chairman Casey Bloys, who was asked by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/"><em>Deadline</em></a><em> </em>about speculation that <em>The Last of Us</em>'s third season will be its last.&nbsp;</p><p>"It certainly seems that way, but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners," Bloys told the publication. "So you can ask them."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps Bloys knows something everyone else doesn't, because last year, following the conclusion of season two of <em>The Last of Us</em>, Mazin said, "But certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season," adding, "Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That's the likely outcome." Maybe Bloys received word from Mazin that the third season will, in fact, be its last; otherwise, it's a bit odd to say, "It certainly seems that way."&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Bloys then said HBO defers to the showrunners, so if Mazin is still set on a fourth season, it sounds like that is also just as likely.&nbsp;</p><p>The third season of <em>The Last of Us </em>is due out on HBO sometime in 2027, though there's no word on exactly when. If it follows in the footsteps of the first two seasons, it could hit the streaming service in early 2027, but only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read about why my set visit to watch the cast and crew film the second season of <em>The Last of Us </em>was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us">equal parts boring and intense</a>, and then read this interview to learn more about The Last of Us co-creator <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">Neil Druckmann's thoughts on the creative process</a> behind making this TV show.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2025 was a year packed with racing releases for the whole family, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a> absorbing hours and hours of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> owners' free time, yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> emerged as the go-to choice for veterans looking for meatier mechanics and demanding circuits. Now, we've learned that it's sold more than 1 million copies, but Sega is thinking bigger.</p>
<p>Following "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/">on Steam</a> and an over 80 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Metacritic score</a>, Sega is bullish on its long-term performance, especially with a physical Nintendo Switch 2 release that hasn't arrived yet. "Initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year," an overlooked <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251107_q2_presentation_with_scripts_e.pdf">results presentation</a> from November 2025 stated (hat tip to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-expecting-another-million-sales-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-for-the-2026-fiscal-year-ending-march-31-2027.1422568/">ResetEra</a>).</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has sold over 2m copies in Japan alone, with its global total well past 9.5m copies by last September (we don't have the current figures). Mind you, these 1m sales numbers for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds are outdated as we wait for more recent results presentations, but with the Switch 2 port launching digitally ahead of Christmas and other versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">showing promise</a> in the lead-up to that period, the racing game could be well on its way to hit the 2m mark.</p>
<p>While Sega has been enjoying a great deal of success thanks to franchises such as Sonic and Like a Dragon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-president-admits-live-service-games-are-the-companys-biggest-challenge">the company has struggled to break into the live-service space</a> while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-finally-admits-low-sales-of-games-may-have-been-impacted-by-players-waiting-for-definitive-editions-like-persona-5-royal-or-smt-5-vengeance">sales of well-received premium games haven't always matched its high expectations</a>. No one has a clear answer as to why critical acclaim and active fan bases aren't boosting the sales numbers further, but the entertainment giant isn't backing down.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SEGA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also buried under the mountain of data and information primarily aimed at shareholders, the current rollout schedule makes it very clear the company is still committed to mining old IPs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>, and Golden Axe in hopes of finding more hits too. Even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-isolation-2-teased-by-creative-assembly-with-original-director-returning">Alien: Isolation sequel</a> fans manifested into existence (currently in development at Creative Assembly) is still on track to arrive in the coming years.</p>

<p>Sharif goes on to say that after he resigned, "much of the senior leadership team" followed suit, and then Intrepid Studios' board decided to "proceed with a mass layoff".</p><p>In closing, Sharif says the development team "acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing", but that he can't elaborate any further "due to ongoing legal and governance matters".</p><p>Intrepid Studios itself hasn't commented on this situation, but just last week, the studio posted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4124950/view/512981748906197719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an update</a> to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s Steam page, promising a development update on February 13th and pledging to "outline Q1 plans and next steps".</p><p>That may not sound much like a game that has been canceled, and it's true that there's been no official word that <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s development is ending, but it's hard to imagine how Intrepid could continue if its entire development team has indeed been let go.</p>
<p>If you need a reminder, <em>Ashes of Creation </em>is an MMO that was Kickstarted back in 2017, pledging to offer features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-gameplay-video-shows-impressive-player-run-town" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="186760a2-cafa-435f-9785-d6ef92342282" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-run towns</a>, an innovative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-features-innovative-story-arc-system-tower-of-carphin-in-new-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fbf13c0-770f-4e1e-a8c7-85bd1fa76b77" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-driven Story Arc system</a>, and an extensive range of combat archetypes to choose from.</p><p>The game was released in Early Access back in December following a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-shows-fighter-archetype-in-action-ahead-of-alpha-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6056f7a8-f458-478e-9379-ea63fef47ffb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">alpha playtests</a>, which makes the idea of its cancellation doubly strange; after all, it hasn't even been two months since <em>Ashes of Creation </em>was released.</p><p>Still, the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> have dropped to Mostly Negative in recent days, with players warning others off buying a game they consider "officially canceled" or "a scam" following its development team's departure.</p><p>You can check out <em>Ashes of Creation </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> if you'd like, although I'd caution against doing so until the situation is a little clearer.
