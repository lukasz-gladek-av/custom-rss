		<p>Odin: Valhalla Rising will be getting its global launch on April 29th for PC, iOS, and Android, Kakao Games has confirmed. Pre-loads for Odin: Valhalla Rising will start on April 28th and character name reservations will open alongside the game pre-registrations which start from April 3rd. Those who do pr-register will get a limited edition Viking-themed avatar and mount as well as other rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="[ODIN:VALHALLA RISING] Pre-registration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4HWmC4quRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Odin: Valhalla Rising, players will be able to explore various realms based upon Norse mythology including Midgaard and Jotunheim as one of four classes. Those classes are Warrior, Sorceress, Priest, and Rogue. Game modes include the 30v30 Valhalla mode, co-op battles, dungeons, and raids. Kakao Games will be adding features further down the line, including a Guild Wars mode. The story of Odin: Valhalla Rising is based upon Ragnarok, with Odin trying to avoid it. He does this by exiling Loki, who doesn’t take this well so awakens different creatures that have been laying dormant in the void of Ginnungagap.</p>

<p><span><span>Nintendo also promised but has not yet shown, a Mineru's Construct Amiibo for the future. Presumably, the Mineru's Construct Amiibo will be a little like Breath of the Wild’s Guardian Amiibo, which was oversized and a little different.</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2.1153602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired today, and it was jam-packed with announcements, including hardware specs, new Mario Kart, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced">Kirby</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">Donkey Kong</a> games, and a long list of third-party titles coming to the console. The one thing it didn't detail, however, is the pre-order process, which is a little convoluted.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="56edb9ce-2e0e-4efe-b723-cffc17c36b65" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Pre-orders at participating retailers will go live next Wednesday, April 9. At the time of publishing, retailers have yet to prepare their individual pre-order pages (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20notifications%20about%20the%20new%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%2C%20games%20and%20more">though Best Buy has a link to sign up for updates</a>), but they will likely be updated within the next few days. That said, based on how recent console launches have gone, it will likely be a fairly frantic process with scalpers attempting to buy up stock to resell at a higher price. Once we learn specific launch times, you'll want to be right on the webpage the moment it goes live to maximize your chances.</p>

<p>To avoid that scramble, you can try to grab your console directly from Nintendo, but there's more to that process than meets the eye. If you head to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">Nintendo's website</a>, you'll be able to sign up to indicate interest in purchasing a system once they're available. To be clear, this is not a pre-order, but a sign-up list to indicate who might want to pre-order, so there's no payment information required. You will, however, need an active Nintendo account – more on that below. Once you sign in, you can choose between a base system for $449.99 USD or a bundle including a digital version of Mario Kart World for $499.99 USD.</p>

</article><p>The timeline here is different, however. Invitations from Nintendo won't arrive until a month or so after, on Thursday, May 8. They'll also come in waves, with additional invites sent out to eligible accounts until the store is open to the general public. Invitations will also only go to account holders that meet the following "priority criteria":</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The account must be the one that purchased a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">That Online Membership must have been active for a minimum of 12 months.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have opted to share gameplay data and played at least 50 hours of games.</li>
</ul><p>If your account fits all three of those criteria, you'll be able to order a console to be shipped to your address – no Nintendo Store pickups are allowed. The link will be active for 72 hours, so it will be less intense than the mad dash on other sites. It also specifies that launch day delivery is not guaranteed and that purchases will be limited to one system per account, though you can also buy accessories for the system.</p>

<p>As wheelchair-bound basketball players, movement involves dragging the Joy-Cons simultaneously to push yourself forward, simulating the movement of pushing a wheelchair. Flicking the controller performs shots, and players can even roll up skateboard-style half-pipes to perform fancy trick dunks. The game’s challenge comes in intuitively using both Joy-Cons at the same time to steer the characters and take it to the hoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

The upcoming multiplayer game will be exclusive to Switch 2.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer follows From Software’s standard of using out-of-context clips, showcasing various characters such as a swordswoman wielding a ringblade and a rocket-powered flying robot. Scenes of a gothic castle complex and cathedral interiors create an oppressive atmosphere, and things take a turn for the bonkers with clips of a guy biting someone’s neck and draining them of a dark substance. A character is also seen transforming into a T-Rex-like monster. From Software describes The Duskbloods as a PvPvE experience, meaning players will face off against other human-controlled characters in addition to in-game enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does it all mean? The vague narration stating that “the moontears will flow for one and one alone” doesn’t illuminate much. However, a developer diary with game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will air on April 4 and should, hopefully, explain more. But until then, color us fascinated given From Software’s stellar track record.</p>

<p>The Duskbloods is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

Sakurai is the originator of both the Kirby franchise and Smash Bros., so his involvement with the new Air Riders is exciting news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details are scarce on the new game, but footage revealed Kirby flying along on a star beside three of his other-colored Kirby friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Kirby Air Ride released on GameCube over 20 years ago. It was a racing game with simplified controls and high-speed course navigation, which also highlighted Kirby’s ability to suck up enemies and absorb their abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while some games from today’s Nintendo Direct were highlighted as launch games, Kirby Air Riders features no date of launch on Switch 2.</p>

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wilds/Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Pokémon Legends Z-A, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are the first titles confirmed to play better on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmDD7JSfhcE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 editions of the acclaimed titles feature improved resolution and framerates and now support HDR. They’ll also exclusively support a new feature called Zelda Notes, a new feature for the Nintendo Switch app. This app guides players using voice navigation to find hidden Korok and shrines. Players can also share creations with QR codes, which adds it to another player’s game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/whats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2/">For&nbsp;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members who already own Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Switch 2 upgrade packs will be included with your subscription</a>.</p>

<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0jkSlm6gVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 addition includes Jamboree TV, an expansion introducing new minigames such as Bowser Live, the mouse-controlled Carnival Coaster, and other games utilizing the Switch 2’s hardware features.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5peJd37J-k" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to a graphical and framerate bump, Kirby’s 2021 adventure is also getting a Switch 2 exclusive story DLC called Star-Cross World. A meteor strikes the Forgotten Land, transforming it into a crystalized version of itself for Kirby to explore and battle newly transformed enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>

</article><p>The upcoming title can be played with mouse controls on Switch 2. It boasts a 4K/60fps Quality Mode (1080p/60fps HDR in handheld), and a 1080p/120fps HDR Performance Mode (720p/120fps HRD in handheld)</p>

<h2>Pokémon Legends Z-A&nbsp;</h2>

</article><p>Those who play the yet-to-be-released Pokémon title on Switch 2 will enjoy enhanced resolutions and framerates</p>

<p>The Switch 2 versions of these titles will be sold as standalone editions (physical and digital). However, those who own the original versions can purchase an Upgrade Pack to get the new versions. Nintendo has not revealed the pricing for the Upgrade Pack or the standalone versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside the games outlined above, Nintendo also shared a number of other Switch 1 games that will get free updates to make them run better on Switch 2 via backwards&nbsp;compatibility.</p>

<ul><li>Arms</li>
	<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</li>
	<li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
	<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</li>
	<li>Clubhouse Games 51 Worldwide Classics</li>
	<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
	<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
	<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
	<li>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</li>
	<li>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Pokémon Violet</li>
	<li>Big Brain Academy Brain vs Brain</li>
</ul><p>In terms of the specifics of how these games will be affected by the update, Nintendo is unclear but writes, "By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/we-know-what-the-switch-2-c-button-does-nintendo-reveals-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june">The Nintendo Switch 2 has finally been revealed</a>, and it looks like it'll be a lot more than a simple specs upgrade. Among other new features, the right Joy-Con also has a mysterious C button, and now we know what it means. The c stands for chat, meaning the Switch 2 will be the first Nintendo console to have native voice chat.</p>

<p>Pressing the button while playing the console will activate chat mode, which creates a line of boxes at the base of the screen with the people in your party. The microphone is included on the top of the main console, so you can speak freely without needing a second microphone. The feature also allegedly can erase background noise: their example had someone using a blender.</p>

<p>You can also fill these boxes, which normally have profile pictures and soundwaves, with game footage. Whether it's the same game or separate ones, players will be able to see each other's screens, though it looks like the footage will have a heavily reduced frame rate, based on what they showed.</p>



<p>You can also show yourself on screen using the Switch 2 Camera, which launches the same day as the console. It can erase your background, placing you in front of your gameplay, or just show a direct feed of your surroundings, no game included. Some games, like Mario Party Jamboree, will also make use of the camera to include players' heads and their reactions. Unlike the game footage, the frame rate of this footage does not look dramatically reduced, though I'm sure that will depend on your internet speed.</p>

<p>This voice chat feature is collectively known as GameChat. The Switch Online service is required to use it, but there will be a months-long period where that's not the case for the game's launch. That period will last from the console's launch in June to March 31, 2026.</p>

<p>For more Switch 2, check out its big launch title, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/mario-kart-world-is-coming-to-switch-2-at-launch">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/mario-kart-world-is-coming-to-switch-2-at-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Today’s Switch 2 reveal kicked off with the next Mario Kart. After two console generations of Mario Kart 8, its true successor is coming in the form of Mario Kart World</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The ninth Mario Kart unfolds on a giant open world filled with various biomes and race courses. For the first time in series history, players are free to drive off the beaten path to freely explore the island in Free Roam. You can uncover hidden routes and locations, including photo ops to take pictures with friends.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Up to 24 racers compete in any given race, the most in series history. Mario Kart World still features the traditional four-race Grand Prix, but players will drive to the next course in between races.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pE23YTYEZM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Another new addition is Knockout Tour. Competitors must race from one side of the massive map to another, hitting checkpoints along the way. However, each checkpoint allows for only a certain number of racers to pass, such as anyone in 8th place and up. You're eliminated from the race if you arrive below that standing, giving Knockout Tour battle royale-style stakes.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The trailer also briefly shows off a new burger power-up that, when consumed, transforms the racers’ costumes to resemble biker attires. It’s unclear what this power-up does beyond the cosmetic change. The footage also showed clips of karts transforming into planes and boats to travel the air and water, respectively.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Mario Kart World is a Switch 2 exclusive and launches alongside the Switch 2 on June 5. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that it will cost&nbsp;</span></span>$79.99, $10 more than the current $70 price ceiling for triple-A games.&nbsp;<span><span>Nintendo will reveal more about the game in a dedicated Nintendo Direct on April 17. </span></span></p>

GameCube games will be available on Nintendo's new console as part of Nintendo Switch Online services.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MvkSVs8f_w" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Nintendo revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX, will be available initially, but promises more games will be coming over time. Nintendo showed&nbsp;Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Super Mario Strikers, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum are all on track to be added in the future.</p>

<p>The first games will be available for Switch 2 on its June 5 release date. A GameCube controller will also be available to purchase the same day as Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642025/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-zelda-wind-waker-f-zero-gx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Before this morning, I knew I was going to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 but I didn’t know when. After watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct today</a>, in which a purple block traced the GameCube’s stylized “G” logo, followed by high-res footage from <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </em>and <em>F-Zero GX </em>and an announcement that they’ll be playable at launch, I realized I’ll be doing my damndest to get it on day one. It was the cherry on top of a stellar presentation that made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">console’s $449.99 price tag</a> way easier to swallow.</p><p>GameCube games are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription’s Classic Game Library feature, which the company is now shortening to “Nintendo Classics.” It lets you play games from the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. Like the Game Boy and Nintendo 64 game collections, you’ll need the NSO Expansion Pack for GameCube games. The existing catalog of playable Classic Game Library games is far from complete, but together (and combined with DLC for contemporary Switch games), they make the Expansion Pack well worth it.</p><p>The subscription gets even more enticing on the Switch 2, starting before the console even comes out — Nintendo is prioritizing long-time subscribers (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">certain caveats</a>) when it sends out Switch 2 preorder invites. The Expansion Pack will also let you play the Switch 2 editions of <em>Zelda </em>games <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Tears of the Kingdom </em>(provided you own their respective Switch 1 versions). </p><p>But the GameCube games are what I’m most excited about. I’d love for the Wii U’s <em>Wind Waker HD</em> to get a Switch re-release, but the GameCube version is still one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played and looks great in Nintendo’s trailer for it. So does <em>F-Zero GX</em>, a game with such well-executed style and tight control that I would pit it against any futuristic racer today. The Switch 2 is also launching with <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, a game that featured adult Link as a playable character in his <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-25c8Rsobw?t=508">post-<em>Ocarina of Time</em> fighting-people-for-sport era</a>.</p><p>The company flashed a few other re-releases coming down the line, like <em>Super Mario Strikers </em>and <em>Chibi-Robo!, </em>in the latter of which you play a tiny, toothbrush-armed robot tasked with cleaning up a very messy house. It’s way more fun than it sounds, and gives me hope for what Nintendo <em>could</em> announce. There are some excellent, but more obscure gems that never really leapt beyond the GameCube, like the creepy, Lovecraft-inspired <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem </em>and <em>Cubivore, </em>in which you play a small, wild cube trying to bring color back to the world by eating other boxy creatures, winning the chance to mate, die, and be reborn over and over again until you’ve become the fittest survivor of them all. </p><p>And all of these will be playable with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">forthcoming wireless recreation of the GameCube controller</a>, as they should be. The GameCube wasn’t an abject failure, but it sold nowhere near as well as the Wii or the Switch. There’s no guarantee that the Switch 2 will keep up the sales pace set by its predecessor, but even if it manages half that console’s sales, it could give some games a well-deserved second look. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2</a> offers a fairly massive upgrade when it comes to raw storage space. The 256GB onboard SSD is four times larger than the Switch OLED (64GB) and eight times the size of the original Switch and Switch Lite (32GB). That said, the Switch 2's performance upgrades will inevitably lead to bigger file sizes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">upcoming games</a>, which could compel you to expand your console's storage capacity. Just like its predecessor, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a microSD card slot. But while the Switch worked with basically every microSD card sold in stores, the Switch 2 is only compatible with a very specific type of storage: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DFQKQ9CB,B0DFQGVLYF,B0DYB7ZGR3,B0DYBW1MNC,B0DYB9TNB4&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">microSD Express cards</a>.</p><p>The Express format is a recent advancement in the semiconductor industry that hasn't been widely adopted by manufacturers yet. The Nintendo Switch 2 will certainly increase its adoption rate by both manufacturers and consumers in a hurry. During this week's Nintendo Direct, we learned that both Samsung and SanDisk will be releasing Super Mario-themed microSD Express Cards this year. If you want to get ahead of any potential Switch 2 storage woes, we've put together a brief list and explainer detailing the microSD Express options available now from SanDisk and Lexar. None of the current cards are themed around Nintendo franchises, but you'll probably save some cash by grabbing a non-branded one anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9CB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 128GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-256G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQGVLYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk 256GB microSD Express Card</a> -- $60 (<del>$65</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB7ZGR3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 256GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYBW1MNC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 512GB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-microSDXC-Express-Nintendo-Switch-LMSXPS0001T-BNNNU/dp/B0DYB9TNB4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lexar 1TB Play Pro microSD Express Card</a> -- $200</li></ul><p>For more on the new console, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">GameSpot's Nintendo Switch 2 preorder guide</a>, which includes all of the first-party hardware and games featured in the Nintendo Direct.

The 128GB model is on sale for $45 (was $50) at Amazon, while the 256GB version is $60 (was $65).</p><p>Though five bucks may not sound like a big discount, if the original Switch's memory situation mirrors its successor, the upcoming licensed versions of the same card with a Super Mario-red color scheme could be sold for markedly higher prices.</p><p>At the moment, it appears SanDisk will release Nintendo-themed versions of its two microSD Express offerings. It remains to be seen if SanDisk cards with more (or less) storage space will get the Nintendo treatment.</p><p>SanDisk microSD Express Cards are substantially faster than its Ultra and Extreme Cards, which are popular picks for expanding storage on the original Switch.</p><p>With Express technology, SanDisk's cards offer read speeds of up to 880MB/s, write speeds of 650MB/s, and sustained write speeds of 210MB/s. For comparison, the SanDisk Ultra is rated for 150MB/s read speeds, and the Extreme can hit 190MB/s.</p><p>Express cards are essentially solid-state drives that can fit on your fingertip.

The 256GB retails for $50, the 512GB is $100, and the 1TB will set you back $200--close to half the price of the Switch 2 console.</p><p>Like the SanDisk Express that debuted last year, Lexar's cards offer blistering speeds. Lexar says its microSD Express Play Pro can reach 900MB/s read speeds and 600MB/s write speeds.</p><p>The manufacturer has already updated its Amazon listing to mention the Nintendo Switch 2, which may be contributing to the wide delivery estimates. Amazon says orders placed today (April 2) for the 256GB and 1TB model will arrive in one to two months. The 512GB edition ships in two to three weeks.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/news/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/semiconductor.samsung.com\/us\/news-events\/news\/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/news/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai/">Samsung microSD Express Cards</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/news/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/semiconductor.samsung.com\/us\/news-events\/news\/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/news/samsungs-new-microsd-cards-bring-high-performance-and-capacity-for-the-new-era-in-mobile-computing-and-on-device-ai/">Pricing TBD</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Samsung announced its own microSD Express Card earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642290/nintendo-switch-2-online-figuring-out-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s perhaps no surprise that Nintendo opened its Switch 2 Direct with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a Switch 2-exclusive launch title that’s a sequel to the original Switch’s most popular game. But it was more of a surprise that the Direct’s second segment, instead of focusing on the console’s specs, was all about Nintendo’s Discord-like GameChat system – a system that seems to show that Nintendo is finally catching up with its online services.</p><p>For playing with your pals, GameChat looks like it could be a lot of fun. You can join a shared call with your buddies and play games together or hang out and share screens of the games you’re playing separately. The Switch 2’s onboard microphone picks up your voice for voice chat, and you can use the Switch 2 Camera accessory, which is designed to sit next to your TV while you play on the couch, to host video chats. Nintendo says other “compatible” USB-C cameras will work, too.</p><p>Even in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI">demo video</a>, you can see that the shared screens have lower framerates than your main screen, and the sound quality from the mics seems iffy. But it appears to be a pretty low-fuss way to hang out and play games with your friends that could be a major selling point for the Switch 2 and a Nintendo Switch Online membership. (Though GameChat will be available in an “Open-Access Period” that doesn’t require Nintendo Switch Online through March 31st, 2026.)</p><p>GameChat is just one of a few smart new things Nintendo is doing with its online services. GameShare, which lets you share a Switch game you have with friends who don’t have it so you can play multiplayer together, works online. (This was <em>another</em> feature Nintendo showed before digging into the Switch 2’s specs.) </p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">getting some upgrades, too</a>. There’s a new name: just Nintendo Switch App. Nintendo Switch 2 players will also be able to access their most recent 100 screenshots or video captures. And the app will contain a new section called “Zelda Notes” that you can use for help while playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online is becoming a better deal, too – at least the premium Expansion Pack tier. That more expensive option will let you play Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">available collection of GameCube games</a>, which will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, and will let you access upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of certain games at no extra cost.</p><p>Nintendo has so far only said that this benefit applies to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. But an image on a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo website discussing the perk</a> includes an image of <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, so it seems like those Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades, when they’re available, will be eventually included in the Expansion Pack, too.</p><p>All of these new changes are in addition to the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">dedicated Nintendo Music app</a>, to which Nintendo is drip-feeding some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623759/nintendo-music-app-legend-of-zelda-link-to-the-past-snes">best</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">soundtracks</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">Nintendo Today news app</a>, which it’s already used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">to break news</a>. It seems like Nintendo is taking its online services more seriously than ever to make its games better and broaden its overall footprint in your life, and all in a very Nintendo way.</p><p>Let’s just hope that GameChat is actually good.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those include tariffs of 34 percent on China and up to 46 percent on Vietnam, where much of the manufacturing for the Switch 2 takes place. Cambodia, another country Nintendo sources from, would face a 49 percent tariff. The new tax hikes are set to go into effect on April 5. </p><p>Tariffs are taxes charged on products when they enter the country. Most companies choose to pass on much or all of the tax in the form of price hikes that then show up on the shelves at stores like Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. Many of the original Switch consoles were manufactured in China, but Nintendo began sourcing from countries like Vietnam and elsewhere after trade war threats during Trump’s first term, seemingly to avoid precisely this scenario.</p><p>“Switch production has been shifting to Vietnam and is around 50:50 versus China currently,” MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <em>Kotaku</em> last fall. “Expect more production to shift to Vietnam with Switch 2, but it  takes 6 months (or more) to gear up. If the mix does not change then prices go up 35%+ for U.S. consumers.” He suggested one result is that more U.S. consumers could start trying to import consoles sold from Europe instead. </p><p>The Consumer Technology Association had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901?_gl=1*h1hjvg*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzYxNzkxMi42OC4xLjE3NDM2MzEzMTguMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901?_gl=1*h1hjvg*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzYxNzkxMi42OC4xLjE3NDM2MzEzMTguMjcuMC4w">previously estimated price increases</a></span> of hundreds of dollars for video game consoles in the U.S., but the new tariffs being signed into law would lead to even more drastic hikes. “President Trump’s sweeping global and reciprocal tariffs are massive tax hikes on Americans that will drive inflation, kill jobs on Main Street, and may cause a recession for the U.S. economy,” Gary Shapiro, the group’s CEO, said in a press release today. “These tariffs will raise consumer prices and will force our trade partners to retaliate.” <br></p><p>As with everything Trump does, it’s hard to know if the latest tariff rollout will stick or is just another stunt aimed at exacting concessions for trade partners. It’s also possible that part of the Switch 2's $450 price tag built in some extra room for Nintendo to eat potential tariff costs before passing them onto fans.

Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz—those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While Nintendo talked a bunch about the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> paid upgrades of a select few original Switch games, there’s also some titles that will be getting free upgrades to support the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Free updates to improve playability on the Nintendo Switch 2 system will be released for select Nintendo Switch games,” Nintendo states.</p>
<p>“By connecting your Nintendo Switch 2 to the internet, you can download free updates that may improve performance or add support for features such as GameShare in select games. The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These updates will work on multiple levels. Simplistically, they can offer visual improvements through higher resolutions and improved frame rates – this will be a boon for both The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of Wisdom, not to mention Pokémon Scarlet and Violet – but there are also patches to enable GameShare for titles with multiplayer.</p>


<p>GameShare lets a single copy of a game be used to share multiplayer access to other consoles, both locally for Switch and Switch 2 devices, and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">GameChat</a> for Switch 2. This is great for when you just want to each have your own personal screen instead of sharing a TV, games where all players might have different viewpoints and camera angles, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">See here for more details for how GameShare works on Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ARMS</li>
<li>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker <em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics<em>– GameShare</em></li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li>
<li>Game Builder Garage</li>
<li>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</li>
<li>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain <em>– GameShare</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between a free update and a Switch 2 Edition paid upgrade seems to be whether or not Nintendo is adding significant content to their games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/23/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-switch/">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> are both getting major content expansions, while the improvements for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> extend to HDR support and Switch Online app support (and these updates can be had when bundled in with Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Cross-gen games like Metroid Prime 4 are more straightforward.</p>
<p>For the free upgrades, they could be as simple as lifting the dynamic resolution bounds and any frame rate caps to let the Switch 2 stretch its legs. We’d love to see similar for games with iffy visual quality and frame rates on the original Switch, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p>

<p>All of this means that third party developers are free to choose their own path. 2K are going down the paid upgrade path for Civilization 7, but other developers will no doubt choose free patches.</p>

            <p>
I'm not sure I've seen people swing back and forth on a game so rapidly like they have with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. It's had a few hiccoughs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">there</a>, which has made for some tough times for developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a>, at least in terms of battling the accursed "mixed" rating on Steam (and lower). In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani quite accurately noted that it's been "one heck of a roller coaster year" for Helldivers 2, and also went on to speak about what it was like clawing its way back from low ratings - all the while having to explain to Sony about summer holidays in Sweden.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As Jorjani noted, at one point in time Helldivers 2 went as low as 30% positive on Steam, which as he says, "usually that's the death knell for a game, but we came back from that." The bigger problem came after some balancing tweaks which brought it down to 19%. "I think [19%] was the lowest. Games that get 19% user score do not generally recover." 
</p>
<p>
Except, at that point, everybody was on vacation. "When I was asked to step in [as CEO], they gave me the keys to the car… and told me: ‘we're going off on vacation, because we haven't been taking much over the last few summers,'" Jorjani explains. "And I was like: ‘we're running a live service game, people can't be off for the next three months!’ But that's what happens in Sweden. We take our summer vacations very seriously."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had to explain this to SIE Studio Business Group CEO too, not exactly an easy task - "maybe the lowest point during my tenure so far" as the Arrowhead CEO put it - but a plan was formed, and reviews have swung back around to positive. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jorjani said he was "inspired" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hello-games">Hello Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, perhaps one of the most infamous games of the past decade when it comes to changing the rhetoric surrounding it. "The game was hyped, then bombed, and then they put the head to the grindstone and just updated the game," Jorjani noted.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Hello Games had a lot more work to do to right that spaceship, it took years to get it to where it's at now. The response to Helldivers 2 has certainly been a lot more volatile, and one could pretty easily argue that that fact speaks to where we're at with live service games: kick up enough of a fuss, and you'll more or less get what you want. In any case, fingers crossed for Arrowhead that Helldivers 2's second year goes a bit smoother.

Who needs a new Donkey Kong game when you got this awesome cow on a scooter doing flips?</p><figure id="" data-id="c4b1048c8fa15fec47f13bf43f626e74"
