		<p>Poncle Games has announced that the PlayStation versions of Vampire Survivors will not have the cross-save feature due to a legal issue. This legal issue is that the cross-save feature on PlayStation would have required Poncle to share partner information, which is something the studio is saying it is unable to share. There is still a miniscule chance of cross-save coming further down the line, but this will require more discussion with PlayStation. The full statement is below.</p>

<p><em>“We’re sorry to say won’t be able to bring the Vampire Survivors Cross-Save feature to PlayStation 4/5 alongside our next update. Last month, we told everyone that Cross-Save would be available on PlayStation 4/5, PC, Xbox, Android and iOS alongside our next free VS update in April. But at last minute, we’ve run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren’t aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we’re unable to. The chances of Cross-Save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim, but not impossible, so we’re going to keep working alongside PlayStation to resolve these problems. We’re so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute Cross-Save will still be available on PC, Xbox, Android and iOS in the next few weeks, with Nintendo Switch following at a later date (+ Apple Arcade if we can do so without breaching any privacy commitments).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>PS: for anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it’s worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform”</em></p>

<p>The cross-save feature will still be coming to PC, Xbox, Android, and iOS in the next game update. It will also be available on Switch later on down the line too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-next-update-will-make-food-actually-worth-investing-in-and-let-you-play-forever-if-youve-got-that-long<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's another week, and with that comes word of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update. The patch isn't ready quite yet, but in a new <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/">update check-in</a> post, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/firaxis-games">Firaxis</a> shared that the game's next update is coming April 22nd, just a couple of weeks away. There's a few big changes coming too, so how about we just jump right in. First up is a change to resources. There'll be ten new resources coming to the game, all of which will get their own new narrative events for starters.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Resources will now crop up differently thanks to a "newly added randomized resource generation system." You'll still get key resources in every age, but past that there'll be a wider variety available on the map. Certain resources will also now only be findable on certain continents or hemispheres, with Firaxis hoping that this "gives your maps a little bit more personality and motivation to explore." Treasure resources will also be getting passive effects too.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the changes coming to food. A lot of Civvers (that's what I call Civilization players, I think it's gonna catch on) apparently found that rural population and food wasn't really worth investing in past a certain point, so Firaxis is making some tweaks to make population growth scale "much more smoothly across your campaign, even deep into later Ages. And, growing beyond 8 or 9 rural Population is now very achievable; doing so won’t take hundreds of turns."
</p>
<p>
This update introduces an endless play mode too, so you can keep going with your campaign once you've finished the modern age thanks to a new Just One More Turn option. There's a returning feature from previous Civ games too, Teams Multiplayer, and a bunch of other additions like a repair all option, less natural disasters, and overall quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
Firaxis also took the time to assure us all by promising that previously mentioned features like auto-explore and new map types are still in the works too, they just won't be in this update. In the meantime, just keep Civving (that's a new verb I just made for when you're playing Civilization, I think it's gonna catch on) it up!

                <p>Nitrome, the developer behind Shovel Knight Dig, has announced a new game called Mouse Work. It is exclusively built around the use of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/" data-ref-id="1100-6530529">Nintendo Switch 2's mouse controls</a>.</p><p>Mouse Work really embraces the "mouse" idea. It's a party game in which players use Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to control mice and complete minigames. We see a few of these minigames in action in its debut trailer, such as ones where players pick up and stack boxes, paint the lines that appear on a canvas, close annoying pop-up ads on a PC desktop, shoot asteroids in space, guide rock climbers up a wall, and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Mouse Work, each of these minigames is billed as a job that players must complete to earn Cheddar, the game's in-game currency. Players can then use Cheddar to buy new cosmetics for the mouse cursors that players control. The official description reveals that the whole game can be played in either solo or co-op. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> is the title that most immediately comes to mind as a comparable game.</p><p>Mouse Work is notable for being the first built-for-Switch-2 indie game announced in the wake of the system's reveal last week. It fills the same niche as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut It Out Together!</a> as a kid-friendly, cooperative launch window game where players can get a grip on one of the Nintendo system's core hardware concepts. Where Snipperclips emphasized easy cooperative play, Mouse Work takes advantage of the mouse capabilities of the Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p><p>Nitrome has yet to confirm a release date for Mouse Work, simply saying that it "will release hot on the tail of the Nintendo Switch 2." The new system will come out on June 5 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch lineup</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> 11.1.5 update is landing April 22, and with it new features like a boss rush mode and the return of Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions. However, what players are perhaps most excited about is that the update will finally bake in a UI alternative to one of the game's most popular (and, in the opinion of many WoW players, required) add-ons.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24186695/patch-1115-arrives-on-april-22" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, patch 11.1.5 will officially add the Cooldown Manager to the game's customizable UI, giving players far more control over tracking their character's various abilities and buffs. Players will be able to better track their utility cooldowns with a special bar, see easy-to-read meters showing the time remaining on buffs, and more easily watch out for the essential abilities coming off cooldown. It's something the game's default UI has been sorely missing for quite some time, resulting in players turning to free third-party add-ons to meet their needs, specifically an add-on called WeakAuras.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The 11.1.5 Content Update goes live April 22!<br>🕷️ Nightfall campaign<br>📊 Cooldown Manager UI Update<br>✨ Winds of Mysterious Fortune Leveling Event<br>🔮 Horrific Visions Revisited - May 20<br>⚔️ Dastardly Duos Event - June 3 <a href="https://t.co/HTgj7RHHbo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HTgj7RHHbo</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While the Cooldown Manager won't offer quite as much granular customization as WeakAuras (which can get very complex), it does offer much of the basic functionality and benefits of the add-on, minus all the hassle. It's not the first time Blizzard has sought to improve its UI and make it so add-ons feel like less of a requirement. As part of the game's Dragonflight expansion, Blizzard dramatically overhauled the MMORPG's UI and introduced far more customization to it than ever before, significantly reducing the need for players to install popular UI add-ons like Bartender. Over time, Blizzard has continued to update the UI to make it far more usable right out of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt many players will still use WeakAuras due to how highly customizable it is, but for players who are more casual and don't feel like spending hours setting up WeakAuras for each of their characters, the default Cooldown Manager will be a great alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">As for actual content coming as part of 11.1.5, things will kick off on April 22 with a new scenario and quests revolving around the Flame's Radiance, a new Renown faction that will see players defending Hallowfall from invading Sureki forces. In addition to new cosmetics and a tabard that will change visually as players rise through the Renown ranks, players will also unlock buffs that will make them stronger while in Hallowfall and Azj-Kahet. A leveling event that will grant 20% more XP, as well as a hefty Renown reputation buff for Dragonflight and The War Within factions, will also begin April 22.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions feature will return on May 20, allowing players to once again battle through Old God corrupted versions of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to earn not only up to Heroic level gear but also new cosmetics and enchants. Then on June 3, Blizzard will introduce a new feature called Dastardly Duos, a boss rush-style mode that will see players battling against two or more bosses from the game's past at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW's 11.1 update, Undermine(d)</a>, released February 21 and saw players travel to the fabled goblin city, though the Race to World First to clear the Mythic difficulty of the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-exploiters-cleared-new-mythic-raid-first-using-grey-items-got-banned-and-then-did-it-again/1100-6530118/" data-ref-id="1100-6530118">Liberation of Undermine raid was disrupted by a group of exploiters</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear</a>'s grim and competent special ops protagonist Solid Snake was only grim and quiet thanks to strict tech limitations restricting what his creator, Hideo Kojima, could do with him. Kojima made the comments in a recent interview with Japanese magazine An-An (which <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton </a>translated) and said the severe hardware restrictions of the MSX2, which Metal Gear first released on, meant he couldn't get too ambitious with his new creation's emotional profile.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was 1986 when I entered the game industry," Kojima said. "Games still couldn’t speak. Characters did not have voices. Kanji fonts weren’t supported, and you could only show one katakana character at a time. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut title Metal Gear (1987), was born as a silent ‘tough guy’ because of these circumstances."</p><p dir="ltr">Those circumstances had changed by the time Kojima and Konami developed Metal Gear Solid in 1998, when Snake had a voice actor and more things to say. However, by that point, Kojima had made Solid Snake's stoic gruffness part of the character's personality. He said he envisioned Snake as a character similar to James Bond or Lupin the Third, delivering "snappy lines" when the situation called for them. Kojima also said he attributed much of the character's popularity to David Hayter's voice work in the English version and Akio Otsuka's in the Japanese release.</p><p dir="ltr">Hayter reprised his role as Solid Snake (and sometimes Big Boss) in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, along with a few spin-offs. While his personality remained largely the same, Konami experimented with a more involved role for Snake over the years, with Snake being rather chatty in some games and unusually reticent in others, such as Metal Gear Solid V. However, Kiefer Sutherland voiced Solid Snake in that game.</p><p dir="ltr">His personality in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake won't change, though--at least in the main campaign. Konami confirmed that the studio is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-using Metal Gear Solid 3's original voice track</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid 3: Delta</a>. Hayter, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gears-david-hayter-seemingly-teasing-new-performance-as-snake/1100-6526906/" data-ref-id="1100-6526906">teased new voice work in October 2024</a>, though whether it's for a new Metal Gear game or some sneaky new additions to Metal Gear Solid 3 is anyone's guess.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though it's been in early access for almost a year now, at time of writing, the full release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-second-update-tweaks-major-core-combat-mechanics/">Hades 2</a>, set to arrive sometime later this year, is easily one of the most anticipated releases for 2025.</p>
<p>However, just like the launch of the original Hades, players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles will have to wait to play the full release. During a Creator's Voice video from Nintendo published on Tuesday, Supergiant Games confirmed that Hades 2 will be a Nintendo console-exclusive game at launch.</p>
<p>That means when it arrives at the still unannounced release date, it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. If you don't have any of those devices and only play on a PlayStation or Xbox console, you'll have to wait a little longer to check out the full release of Hades 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hades 2 was one of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">third-party games confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct last week, though it was not confirmed to be one of the launch titles for the console, as we're still without a release date for the full game.</p>
<p>It arrived on PC in early access on May 6, 2024, and at the time of writing, that one-year anniversary is less than a month away. It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we didn't have to wait too much longer to hear more about when the 1.0 version of Hades 2 is ready to release.</p>
<p>The original Hades spent almost two years in early access, and while it's entirely plausible the same could happen here, all signs point to Hades 2 being ready for its full launch far ahead of that timeline.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is the first sequel Supergiant Games has ever done, with each of its previous projects being one-and-done titles that have all added to its mythical status as an indie developer that simply does not miss. Early access players are already loving Hades 2 and can't wait for the full release. It is almost surely a lock for one of the games that'll be a part of 2025's Game of the Year conversation.</p>

<p>Completing every achievement in Blue Prince, like reaching room 46, will be difficult, even for grizzled puzzle genre veterans. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is far from the traditional puzzle title. Dogubomb’s debut project puts you in the shoes of an heir to Mount Holly Manor and features tabletop card game and roguelike exploration elements. The simple objective is to explore all 45 rooms of the house and discover a secret 46th room, but there is a twist.</p>



<p>Each door opens to one of three rooms, and the choice is yours. The floor plan resets at the end of each in-game day, changing the house layout. It’s up to you to discover tools and permanent upgrades to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of a children’s book author and more secrets along the way. And If there is one thing puzzle fans also love, it’s trophy hunting in games. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-every-blue-prince-achievement">How to Complete Every Blue Prince Achievement </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blue Prince has mysteries inside and outside the manor. Image via Dogubomb. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Every room in Mount Holly Manor features some puzzle, tool, or blueprint to discover. Yet, what makes Blue Prince so unique is that players don’t need to complete every challenge. Every player will experience their own journey based on the map layout. However, this list of achievements applies to everyone and can be completed by following the steps below. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/john-carmack-defends-ai-amid-backlash-over-microsofts-generative-quake-ii-demo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The current generative <em>Quake II</em> demo represents a slight advancement from Microsoft's previous generative AI gaming model (confusingly titled "WHAM" with only one "M") we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/microsofts-new-interactive-ai-world-model-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">covered in February</a>. That earlier model, while showing progress in generating interactive gameplay footage, operated at 300×180 resolution at 10 frames per second—far below practical modern gaming standards. The new WHAMM demonstration doubles the resolution to 640×360. However, both remain well below what gamers expect from a functional video game in almost every conceivable way. It truly is an AI tech demo.</p>

      </figure>

<p>For example, the technology faces substantial challenges beyond just performance metrics. Microsoft acknowledges several limitations, including poor enemy interactions, a short context length of just 0.9 seconds (meaning the system forgets objects outside its view), and unreliable numerical tracking for game elements like health values.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another point: A significant gap persists between the technology's marketing portrayal and its practical applications. While industry veterans like Carmack and Sweeney view AI as another tool in the development arsenal, demonstrations like the <em>Quake II</em> instance may create inflated expectations about AI's current capabilities for complete game generation.</p>
<p>The most realistic near-term application of generative AI technology remains as coding assistants and perhaps rapid prototyping tools for developers, rather than a drop-in replacement for traditional game development pipelines. The technology's current limitations suggest that human developers will remain essential for creating compelling, polished game experiences for now. But given the general pace of progress, that might be small comfort for those who worry about losing jobs to AI in the near-term.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sweeney says not to worry: "There’s always a fear that automation will lead companies to make the same old products while employing fewer people to do it," Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1909314230391902611">wrote</a> in a follow-up post on X. "But competition will ultimately lead to companies producing the best work they’re capable of given the new tools, and that tends to mean more jobs."</p>
<p>And Carmack closed with this: "Will there be more or less game developer jobs? That is an open question. It could go the way of farming, where labor-saving technology allow a tiny fraction of the previous workforce to satisfy everyone, or it could be like social media, where creative entrepreneurship has flourished at many different scales. Regardless, “don’t use power tools because they take people’s jobs” is not a winning strategy."</p>

This year’s other top-rated games so far include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and fellow puzzle adventure <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em>. <em>Blue Prince</em> is much harder to talk about than those games, though, in part because explaining too much can ruin the joy of discovery what’s so great about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654">similar to <em>The Outer Wilds</em></a></span>. </p><p>It’s enough to know the basic premise: you’re exploring a mansion that will be bequeathed to you from a dead relative if you can discover its hidden 46th room. Every time you hit a doorway you can select from a set of rooms to “draft” on the blueprints (Get it? <em>Blue Prince</em>?) for it to appear on the other side. This will impact what resources, clues, and additional doorways you find inside. Once you deplete your “stamina” for the day you go home and rest, coming back the next morning to a completely blank slate to be drafted all over again with the help of everything you’ve learned and new room types you’ve unlocked.</p><p>“Later runs in <em>Blue Prince</em> are less about puzzle solving or deckbuilding, and more about excursionary quests into the house to solve certain puzzles (“Can I somehow get the Boiler Room to connect to the Laboratory?”) or information gathering sessions as you try to piece together a message obliquely scattered across all but one room in the mansion,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes Aidan Moher</a></span>. “It’s about unravelling the spooled mystery behind the mansion and its titular blue prince, a fascist nation, and the cost of freedom. It’s not so much about solving puzzles as it is about understanding the link between agency, experience, and story. Journey before destination.”</p><p>This might not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but a really nice bonus for <em>Blue Prince</em> is that the it’ll be practically free for millions of players who are already subscribed to Game Pass on Xbox and PC or PS Plus on PlayStation 5. “Polished indie puzzle game with simple mechanics but bold ideas on a subscription service” recalls last year’s<em> Animal Well</em>, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">strong 2024 GOTY contender</a></span> in its own right. But there are two notable distinctions. Calling <em>Blue Prince</em> a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metroidbrania</a></span>” would probably make people who use that genre nickname mad, and also <em>Animal Well </em>was <em>only</em> on PS Plus. This time around, players on every platform get to take advantage of a a big day-and-date get for subscription services (except Switch). </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-blizzard-tells-ign-whats-coming-to-diablo-4-in-2025-and-2026-including-new-expansion-new-ranking-system-and-finally-leaderboards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 is set to be a big year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Blizzard’s near two-year-old action role-playing game, and that’s despite the delay to its second expansion from this year into 2026. It’s set to launch Season 8 later in April, with Season 9 currently due out in the summer, and Season 10 later in the year. Each will improve the game in key ways, addressing fan feedback and adding long-requested features. And then, looking into 2026, Blizzard will launch Diablo 4’s second expansion, following on from last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, add a new ranking system, and, finally, leaderboards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, for the first time ever, Blizzard has published a Diablo 4 roadmap of content, providing fans with the kind of long-term insight into what to expect from the game they’ve never had before. There are even teases for upcoming IP collaborations thrown in there for good measure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why is Blizzard doing this now, and what, exactly, are the juicy details on Diablo 4’s upcoming updates? IGN sat down with game director Brent Gibson to quiz him on all that and more in an exclusive interview to coincide with the roadmap, below.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/06/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap touches on 2026. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This [roadmap] is new for Blizzard's Diablo team, right? So there's got to be a reason why you're doing it now for the first time. What are the factors that have gone into you making that decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> We've never really been in the position to deliver on a roadmap with the game up until now, right? So when we released the base game, we were getting an influx of feedback from the community on what we should be going after. And so we were in this very reactionary, like, let's stay on top of the big emerging issues that are coming out with the game. And we wanted to be in a position by this year to be able to be more proactive and be in a spot where we can predict out to a year on some of our ambitions and what we want to go after, and be able to do it confidently, knowing the types of things we wanted to commit to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the value of a roadmap is us getting out there saying, 'hey, look, these are the things that we want to go after. We hear you.' We really want to make sure we're going after the things that really matter during the seasons, and create consistency and quality in those releases. And so for the first time, we're actually in a spot where we can see out into that future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When I think of Diablo historically, it's not as a live service game. It was more, you paid for the game and you had the expansions, and the expansions were a big deal, almost like mini-releases. But for Diablo 4 it does feel different. It feels like more of a live service<strong>. </strong>So I wonder if that creates more of a condition for a roadmap to be appropriate for Diablo 4 as opposed to the previous games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> It does. There's a reason why they're called roadmaps, because it literally is a road leading to what we want to do in 2026 with the expansion. A lot of the strengthening of our core from season to season are things that we're building upon, to taking those bigger swings in the expansion itself. And so it's important to us that there is that connectivity. That it is all working out in order and in a plan. And so even though it's not always very transparent about what that plan is, we're hoping that the roadmap is something that shows players those steps that we're taking, so that when we get to the point of announcing the expansion, all those pieces come together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Do you feel like the audience now when it comes to live service games is hungrier than ever for constant content and constant transparency? Needing to know what's coming at any given moment, and wanting a relentless release of updates? I've been watching the Marvel Rivals team and it's just incredible with the pace of their updates. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up">they've just said a new hero every month</a>. Is this just the way things have to be now if you're operating a successful life service? Is it more brutal than ever?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I definitely feel like gamers are more hungry than they've ever been. And even if you delivered on their appetite today, that appetite will shift tomorrow. And so you just have to be in a really good spot to adapt to that situation. Because a lot of times too, what's important this month is going to be completely different three months from now. The priority of things can shift very, very quickly based on another game release or the state of your own game. Or maybe we've discovered something really cool and we want to be able to get it in there to change the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so it is definitely a new way of developing. It is definitely high interaction with the community. The interesting thing about Diablo is that we have a lot of different community types, right? We have our casual players, we have our hardcore players. They all fall into subdivisions of types of players inside of that. And so what we look to do is season upon season, look at the things that are important to some of those groups and go after them with focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you take a look at something like what we're doing in Season 8, we know we have a ton of boss lair feedback and so we're adding in the quality of life improvements for those players where that is a big focus of their gameplay type, or we might shift to nightmare dungeons when we're in Season 9. And so it's an opportunity for us to address different groups at different times, leading to an expansion where we're going to be addressing everybody all at once with something big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>And that's a really nice lead into my next thought on this, which is you are trying to do it all with Diablo 4. It's not just live service with seasons as we're familiar with live service games, but you're also building big paid expansions on top of that. I can only imagine the challenges you must face trying to do everything with Diablo 4 to keep it interesting and everyone engaged. I know the original plan was for an expansion every year, but that's obviously not happening. Is that one of the byproducts of having to do all of this stuff all at the same time, and also trying to do an expansion as well, when most games don't have to think about doing both of those things?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah, we've learned a lot about what it means to do both at the same time. I feel like we've done a good job at trying to not be beholden to the plan. And so if we needed the extra time for the expansion based on everything we learned on Vessel of Hatred, we're taking the time to focus on the expansion in a responsible way. We don't want to push it out 10 years. That's crazy. But the adjustments you've seen are because of key learnings and the feedback that we're seeing. And some of the strategy you're seeing with what we're doing with seasons is to bring consistency and control in one area so that we can get a little more aggressive in another area. And so the roadmap is a really good example of that where you can see that consistency, while also shifting our focus from activity type to activity type to refresh things for different style of players that have feedback for the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>So let's let's dig into the roadmap a little bit<strong>. </strong>'Dungeon escalation' — what are we getting there?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>So you'll notice with the roadmap as we make our way out further into the year, the words are fancy and they have some meaning and they have intent. You could see in that season that the word 'dungeon,' we're going to be focusing on dungeons here, right? You got new nightmare dungeon activities that are in this mix as well. We know that nightmare dungeons, or dungeons in general is the bread and butter of Diablo, is playing that procedural content. And based on a lot of feedback, variety and challenge is one of those things that is a major ask for bringing nightmare dungeons back into the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so even though I'm not going to share the details that far out, you can see that the spirit of our intent is going to address that part of our game. The idea there for that season is about challenge and variety and that's the goal that the team has, and they're in development of that right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Part of the sentiment among the core community is that Diablo 4 isn't hard enough. Is that season about addressing some of that feedback?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah, and it's not exclusive to that season. We met as a team at the very beginning of the year and bringing challenge back into the spotlight is something that we're focusing on over the course of all the seasons. And how does a statement like that apply from activity to activity in our game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're seeing with Season 8, we're bringing a lot of challenge back into the boss lairs, and trying to make sure that difficulty is something that we're keeping an eye on, while also not losing sight of accessibility. Because this is a game where we got a lot of people come in just to blast and relax. And so we don't want it to be an experience that is hard at the sacrifice of fun. But we know that areas in our game that we can tackle that in a way that will be good for the casuals and great for the blasters, and we should be in a good spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>It must be a really tricky balancing act.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah. If we did that to the game as a whole, it would not service our goal. This is one of the reasons why our difficulty system has such a wide band in it, all the way from easy to the later stage in Torment. The goal isn't to just say we're dialing everything up. That is not the case. It is to take a look at the progression of a character and look at those spots where we can create an additional spike that is appreciated by the audience that just needs that one last little push, right? And so that's the way that we've been looking at it, is more of like, how does the entire curve play across our broader audience, and not sacrificing one audience for the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Console keyboard and mouse support also caught my eye. How come it took so long?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I can't answer on why it took this long from a deep level. But it's one of the things that the players have been asking for quite a bit, and now that we are starting to get into the groove with the ongoing development of the game, we're in a spot where we can start addressing issues like that and bring something new to the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My son was super happy because he's converted to a keyboard and mouse guy but he loves his console. And so, being in a position where we can create more access to all different types of players is very important to us. Accessibility is huge for us. We put a ton of attention on it. We don't want the hardware to be the barrier. So we implement anything we can to create that quality of life, and I think this is going to be a pretty big one in that season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I know this is probably not something you can talk deeply about, but people get excited by new IP collabs, and there's two of them in there. People might think of silly stuff, start talking about Microsoft stuff, Activision stuff and all sorts. Is there anything you can say about what people can expect, or maybe how you approach them and what's right and what isn't right for Diablo 4?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>When you think about Diablo, it is one of <em>the</em> dark fantasy IPs, right? And as developers, we're also fans of lots of other IPs that are that power fantasy of being in that dark gothic universe. So you can imagine that there's a pretty heavy influence that is even beyond Diablo itself in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of the game we're role-playing through those dark fantasies. And so I think something you can expect is us reaching out to other IPs that fit really well inside of our universe, and we can do some really cool cosmetic stuff and make it really exciting. But it's not anything that is actually going to betray the brand, right? We talk a lot about, 'hey, when's the French Fries sword coming?' We are avoiding the French Fries sword at all costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we really selected the collaborations we're looking at very carefully. Even though I don't want to expose what we're doing coming up, it is one of those things where it's like it, it's going to be fun, it's going to be super cool, it is totally Diablo. And so once it goes live, hopefully you'll log in and check it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I play a lot of Call of Duty and COD has this thing where the mil-sim fans are like, 'I hate that there are lizards and dragons and fairies and unicorns shooting me.' In the context of everything that's happened with Activision Blizzard in the last couple of years, some fans are worried that's going to happen to Diablo. But from the sounds of things it's not going to end up like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>No. That is absolutely counter to our goal. And so when we're looking at these things, we take a really hard look at making sure that the things that we're bringing to the table, our fans are also fans of. So there's never a moment where you're like, 'wait, really? That's in there?' And so we're holding the line on that. I say holding the line, but we're all aligned on it. There's no question that this is the way that we want to approach it. And the one we have coming up in Season 8 is pretty cool and very spot on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Is there anything in September to December that players should be excited for or should be keeping an eye out for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Season 10 is a really good example of us taking a hard look at not only the activities that need to get refreshed because their role has maybe waned in popularity, but also looking at the things that are working really well and continuing to invest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infernal Horde is one of the most popular activities in the entire game. People really enjoy playing it. They put tons of hours into it. So we're going to take the opportunity to also give it a little bit of love and put a little more player choice options out there for you to have in the experience and plus that up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so very similar to what we did with Helltide very early on where it's like, yeah it's going well, but we're still gonna do something more. Not only are we shoring things up, but we're gonna continue to push some of our activities forward. Season upon season, I really like the idea of us keeping our house in order as we're making our way through the 2025 year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>So now the juicy stuff. Before we talk about new expansion, there's a new ranking system and leaderboards in 2026. Finally! I mean it's next year, but still at least it's coming and we know now. What can you tell me about the leaderboards and the new ranking system?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I can talk about it philosophically. I remember having the conversation: 'we want to be able to say leaderboard when we come out with this roadmap, even if it is a year out, right?' The important thing to us is that players know that we're listening, but we want to make sure that we get it right. Doing a leaderboard is really, really challenging. When we took a first stab at it with Gauntlet, we learned a lot of things with Gauntlet. We had a lot of new power being injected into expansion one, so that led us to take a breath and see where we're at with classes and bring that back into harmony. And now that we're here, we're like, 'OK, what's the right way to do this?'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're investing into leaderboards as we move forward. I won't exactly say how. That will be revealed as time passes by, but we want to work with the community on getting to a place where we've done it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we also know that leaderboards speak to the very upper echelon of our players, and so we want to also introduce something that speaks to everybody. And so this is where we want to have a system that also tells you, 'hey, as you're playing, as you're building your character, how are you doing? Where do you sit rank wise with the rest of the world?' And being able to have a very casual, friendly understanding of am I good or not? Am I doing good or not, right? And so it was important that we deliver both parts of that equation together so that there is something for everybody. And then there's that hard, aspirational go get it at the very end as well. I am super excited about the designs that we've been talking about, and we've been iterating on this for quite some time, and hopefully in the near future we can talk some details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Exciting. OK, new expansion. Is there anything that you can say about that, for the fans?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I definitely can say that there's a lot coming in the expansion. What we did with Vessel of Hatred was fantastic and just the beginning. And as we've learned from that. We feel like we're even more on the money with what we need to do with the second expansion. We have a whole team dedicated to getting ready to start announcing stuff over a really great campaign, to let you know what's going in on this. We're paying attention to it right now. The team is just like, that is priority number one. And so they've been putting all their heart and energy into making sure that it is the best release we've had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on what we're talking about before, we're taking that time to steady the core season to season so that this expansion is the biggest expansion we've delivered yet. So, feeling really great about it. I'm dying to talk more about it. Can't at this time, but hopefully very soon we can revisit this chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-smash-hit-schedule-1-getting-investigated-by-drug-dealer-simulator-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's drama in the PC gaming, meth cooking world, and it's all about whether or not the latest Steam craze, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/schedule-i"><u>Schedule 1</u></a>, is getting sued by the publishers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/drug-dealer-simulator"><u>Drug Dealer Simulator</u></a>, Movie Games. After some review bombing of its titles Movie Games has now come forward to clarify the situation, stating that currently, there is no lawsuit against the creators of Schedule 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Movie Games suggested that the confused reports were probably the result of attempts to translate the news from the <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>original Polish source</u></a> of the information, but added that it was investigating the similarities between the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Due to repeated opinions that Schedule I is very similar to DDS, we were obliged to request a legal analysis from an intellectual property specialist. It has indicated that there might have been an infringement by the Schedule I developers in relation to Drug Dealer Simulator," said Movie Games spokesperson Michal P (AKA Movie Games head of marketing Michał Puczyński) in a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/868108788266332180/868117709194408016/1358455569081438229" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord post</u></a> on Sunday. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Now we are obliged to follow up further, but we are yet to contact the Schedule I developers. Our goal at this point is discussing the situation with them and we have an open approach."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drug Dealer Simulator was released in 2020 and like Schedule 1, focuses on the mechanics of producing and selling illegal substances. While the subject matter is similar, Drug Dealer Simulator leans into a more realistic look while Schedule 1 has a look that screams "what if I designed Rick and Morty while having a nervous breakdown?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puczyński went on to assure gamers that "it is not our intention to prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game." He also made clear that Drug Dealer Simulator's developers, ByteRunners, had no role in the decision to investigate. Byterunners also made that clear in a post on social media. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear fans, in light of the legal investigation controversy taking place between our publisher, Movie Games, and Schedule I, here is our official statement regarding the situation. <a href="https://t.co/NkK9fLRYQz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NkK9fLRYQz</a></p>— Byterunners (@ByterunnersGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/ByterunnersGS/status/1909638114311913793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, our goal is to support all devs, but we need to consider our legal obligations if law specialists determine that there are grounds to claim infringement;" continued the Movie Games statement from Puczyński.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We even contacted TVGS via email just before the release, when the game was already huge, and wished them all the best - but that was before that legal analysis. Back then no one expected it to be needed, not to mention that it would bring these results."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So good news for Schedule 1 addicts who, at least for now, go back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/schedule-1/How_to_Get_Coca_Leaves">growing Coca Leaves</a> for completely innocent reasons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <p>
Amid speculation Nintendo might be considering a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> price hike following last week's announcement of significant US trade tariffs, one analysis firm has told Eurogamer it expects the company to stick with its previously announced $450 launch price in the US - as it predicts Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever.
</p>
<p>
Last week saw Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">make the unprecedented decision to delay Switch 2 preorders in the US</a> just hours after announcing them, saying it was doing so "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions". More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has admitted</a> that while the Trump administration's earlier trade tariffs weren't a factor in determining Switch 2's price point, the latest wave of tariffs - which have heavily impacted countries where much of Nintendo's manufacturing is focused - create a "challenge", and are "something [the company is] going to have to address." 
</p>
<p>
Some have speculated Nintendo might respond by raising Switch 2's price in the US, despite the fact its existing $450 USD price tag has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">already seen a vocal pushback from fans</a>. However, analyst David Cole, founder of games industry marketing and research firm DFC Intelligence, has told Eurogamer his firm sees a change in price as unlikely at launch. "We are expecting Nintendo to stick with the $450 price point," Cole told Eurogamer, "and we believe that price point was reached with the threat of tariffs already looming."

<p>
However, in its <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/the-evolution-of-console-gaming-insights-on-the-switch-2s-debut/">initial Switch 2 guidance</a>, DFC also suggests US trade tariffs - which include a 24 percent levy on Japanese goods - could lead to a 20 percent price increase for the console over the next two years. As such, it's lowered its initial 2025 worldwide forecast for Switch 2 from 17m to 15m units sold. "If prices increase substantially due to tariffs," it notes, "a significant portion of prospective buyers are likely to hold back on a purchase until prices come down."
</p>
<p>
Cole tells Eurogamer DFC's revised forecast factors in both a potential price hike and "the possibility that there may be a supply issue if Nintendo chooses to limit production initially" due to tariffs. "Nintendo is very conservative," he adds, "and they don't like to take big risks on having surplus inventory. So they may take a bit of a wait and see approach given some of the current unknowns."
</p>
<p>
Despite DFC's revised sales forecast, the firm notes shifting 15m units in 2025 would still make Switch 2 the "fastest-selling gaming console to date, outpacing its predecessor". And looking further ahead, it believes "the upper limit for hardware sales... is enormous", adding, "As the Switch 2 matures it has the ability to capture an even larger share than the original Switch."
</p>
<p>
"With its expanded appeal and focus on capturing new consumer segments," the firm writes, "it will likely redefine what constitutes the core Nintendo audience. Historically seen as a niche or standalone ecosystem, Nintendo is now poised to engage more directly with the broader competitive landscape dominated by Sony and Microsoft... This shift could mark a transformational moment for the video game industry, as the Switch 2 positions itself as a serious contender across multiple demographics and game genres."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is still scheduled to launch worldwide on 5th June, despite Nintendo's decision to indefinitely delay pre-orders in the US - a delay that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">now impacted Canada</a> as the company moves to "align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US".
</p>
<p>
And it's not just Nintendo. Earlier this month, US trade group the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">said the Trump administration's tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a> as a whole.

            <title><![CDATA[Games Writing Words I Hate]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-writing-words-i-hate.1158603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Kotaku, our style guide contained a list of over-used or meaningless phrases that were banned from headlines and articles. My strongest memory is of “looks” making an appearance every press conference season, very good advice that also forced me to think more deeply about what had actually <em>happened</em> during a marathon of trailers. In my decade-plus of working as a professional editor in games journalism, I’ve developed my own personal list of words I axe from drafts. Since it’s Inside Baseball week, here’s some games writing words I hate and why I hate them.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these words are jargon, either from game development or games marketing, while others are vague. I am pretty pedantic as an editor (“But what does this <em>mean</em>?” is one of my most commonly-written notes), but it’s usually in service of pushing a writer to be specific. I'm also aware that I too have used these words, probably on this very website, because many of them are pretty entrenched in how we talk about games. I’ll try to offer some alternatives to the words I criticize in this list, just so I don’t come off like a complete crank. </p><p><strong>Immersive:</strong> This is an easy one, since discourse around this word returns every few years. In a 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyY1xt-YnCY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video essay</a> on the topic, <a href="https://iam.benabraham.net/2012/04/14/attention-and-immersion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Abraham</a> pointed out that calling something “immersive” can lead to “appealing but meaningless statements,” and I think that really sums up why this word is so useless in games writing. It looks good on paper, but what does it actually <em>mean</em> to be “immersed?” You’re just saying that you…had a lot of emotions, that the game felt realistic, that you were paying attention? As praise, it’s contributed to the high-fidelity graphics race that is ballooning production costs and pricing all of us out of hardware. You don’t need to help that happen.</p><p>As an alternative, you guessed it: Be specific. If the boulder scene in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> felt “immersive,” think about what that word is really pointing to for you. Did the game’s accurate recreation remind you of seeing the movie for the first time as a kid? Did the scene have really good sound design? Was it paced in such a way that it felt tense or unpredictable? Tell the reader what you actually experienced and why you valued it, instead of throwing down a tired buzzword.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Franchise:</strong> Regular people do not use this word in their regular lives; no one who isn’t a shareholder is saying “oh boy, another entry in my favorite franchise!” (While we’re at it: “entry” also sucks, but I’m less of a stickler about this one.) “Franchise” is a marketing word, and you don’t work for a game’s marketing department. Just say “series,” jesus christ.</p><p>I know that not everything you might be tempted to call a “franchise” is strictly a “series,” but in this instance I’ll take a potentially fuzzy noun over one that makes you sound like a tool. We all know you’re talking about a video game.</p><p><strong>IP:</strong> Same. There is no reason for you to <em>ever</em> say “IP” unless you are making fun of <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people who say “IP”</a> or are a contracts lawyer. Like with “franchise,” I know it can sometimes be hard to find a non-clunky alternative to this word, but it’s a PR word and you are not on a game’s PR team.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of video games writing words veer close to marketing words; while I don’t consider journalists the enemies of PR per se, we’re doing very different jobs, and the words we choose can make that clear. When marketing words creep into our vocabulary, we blur a boundary fundamental to journalists’ independence, and we also miss out on the opportunity to say the things that we as journalists are uniquely situated to say. Leave the press release talk in your inbox.</p><p><strong>Revealed/Dropped:</strong> Look, I get that this one is pedantic, but unless you work in a video game’s marketing department, a company “showed” or “announced” something. They didn’t <em>reveal</em> it–it’s not a magic trick–and they didn’t <em>drop</em> it–it’s not a new album. Actually, I frequently get into arguments with writers about that last one, because while I get that people use this colloquially, I think it sounds like a hype word. You’re a journalist; you’re not in the business of hype.</p><p><strong>Fun: </strong>Hear me out. One of the big challenges of writing about games is trying to communicate your own reactions and emotions when you’re talking to hundreds or thousands of people you don’t know, who not only have their own tastes but also their own perceptions of their own emotions. What you find “fun” or “moving” or “interesting” or “boring” could be completely different not only to what kinds of experiences give them those emotions, but to how they even understand their experience of those emotions. It’s easy to write “this game is fun” or “this mechanic is fun,” but, like “immersive,” you actually aren’t communicating very much.</p><p>Here, again, is where being specific will be your friend. If you found a game “fun,” give a concrete example of a fun moment and dig into precisely what your experience was. What was “fun” for me about climbing up and down the tea-making machine in <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a><em> </em>was that it was clunky and manual; this strange, slow machine gave the game its particular pace and highlighted that quality in the game itself, as part of its overall message. That has a lot more detail than “Making tea in this game is fun,” and asks you to really dig into your experience with a game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplay loop:</strong> I feel like this one is going to be contentious. To me, this is a game design word, and much like marketing words, I think it behooves us as writers to remember that we aren’t game designers. (You might in fact also be a game designer, but hopefully you get what I mean!) Whether or not games journalists are “in the games industry” has come up a lot in the past few years, particularly in a few <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-insomniac-hack-reveals-the-ugly-truth-of-video-game-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-profile</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instances</a> where our different roles and priorities became clear. I am firmly of the mind that games journalists are in the journalism industry, and as such, we have a wonderful wealth of our own words to use, rather than another field’s. Take advantage of it!</p><p>“Gameplay loop” also veers into jargon territory, another thing I try to excise from writers’ drafts. It can be really tough to avoid jargon without running the risk of talking down to your audience, because it’s hard to know what is or isn’t jargon to such a large, diverse group. Not everyone who plays video games is as dialed in as someone who likes games enough to write about them on the internet. Jargon can be useful–one word instead of several always <em>feels</em> better–but I find it almost never harms my writing to take a moment to consider if there isn’t a simpler or more accessible way to say what I mean. This gives me the opportunity to invite more readers in and maybe teach them something in the process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Addictive:</strong> Many games sites have finally gotten on the same page about this, thankfully. “Addictive” as praise sucks, not just because your readers might struggle with <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-kept-playing-the-costs-of-my-gaming-addiction-5384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compulsive behaviors</a> related to video games, but also because when you think about it, it’s not really meaningfully descriptive. The fact that I <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled with alcohol use</a> isn’t a compliment to alcohol, nor is it–to me at least–a criticism of it; booze was a tool I used to solve a problem, and it took over all my other tools, but you might not have that struggle at all. Addictiveness might say more about you and your experience with something than the thing itself (this isn’t a blanket truth, obviously), and as such is not very useful when describing something.</p><p>“Addictive” also ties into some negative tendencies in game design and how some games want to keep you playing for longer than you might otherwise, but whether or not that constitutes “addiction” is a whole field of thought far bigger than a nit-picky blog about words. If you’re writing an article about predatory practices, just say that. If what you mean is that you really enjoyed playing a game and wanted to keep playing it, <em>just say that</em>, and, as always, give a specific example of a moment and why you felt the way you did.</p><p>(While we’re on substance talk, I’m always a bit chagrined when I have to explain this one, but I tend to edit out “drank the Kool-Aid” in pieces. This is a reference to the brutal end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peoples Temple</a> in 1978; beyond the fact that research has shown that many people did <em>not</em> willingly drink the poisoned Kool-Aid, it was also a hideous tragedy that should not be turned into a glib phrase.)</p><p><strong>Genius:</strong> Maybe this is a hot take, but no one is a “genius.” “Genius” itself is often a marketing word that obfuscates the labor that goes into games and other creative work. People might be very good at what they do, and they might be in the right place at the right time or have access to the right resources so that they get lots of opportunities to be good at that thing, and they might have a whole system or marketing apparatus behind them so that everyone knows how good they are at the thing. But no good comes of praising an individual as a genius, not just for helping readers know more about a person, but for <em>anyone</em> who makes things. I’m looking at you, everyone who writes about Kojima.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re writing about someone who’s very good at something, try to dig into what precisely that looks like, and also <em>why</em>. It’s also a great opportunity to think about and <a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlight </a>the people who are most likely helping them be so good at their thing. There’s probably a way more interesting story there than another fawning profile of someone who already gets talked about to death.</p><p><strong>Game of the Year: </strong>Apart from lists written for SEO purposes, ranking things against each other and deciding which one is the best is a fool’s errand. And look, I’ve written these lists, and I even <em>like </em>them, because it’s nice to see a roundup of things someone liked that I might like too. But it’s a weird practice that the whole internet ecosystem falls into that, sure, has some benefits, but in the long run probably does more harm than good.</p><p>“Game of the year” or “my GOTY” should especially be avoided when you’re writing about one specific game, particularly when the year isn’t over. “This is a contender for my game of the year” means nothing to a reader for the same reasons that “fun,” “boring,” and their ilk mean nothing. Furthermore, you don’t know what the year holds! Life is a terrifying roller coaster and anything could happen! Just say what stood out for you, or what you’ll remember, and, as always, be specific.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Review scores: </strong>I’ll end on an easy one, and I know this isn’t always in a writer’s hands.

			<p>Almost immediately after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct had players excited about the new device and the new games revealed, a dark cloud took shape above that excitement with Donald Trump's announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">steep tariffs</a> imposed on countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the time since, there's been plenty of speculation as to how these tariffs will impact the cost of the console<span>. Nintendo even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed pre-orders for the console in the United States</a> from the original April 9, 2025 date&nbsp;</span>to "<em>assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>That delay will now also impact Canada, as Nintendo confirmed to Canadian publication <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a> that pre-orders for the console have been delayed in Canada "<em>in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S.,</em>" the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date,</em>" the statement continued. "<em>The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged</em>."</p>
<p>It's unfortunate news for Canadians who thought they might've avoided the delay that their southern neighbors are dealing with, especially considering that they are only hearing it a day before pre-orders were meant to go live.</p>
<p>The fate of Canadian gamers' Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order hopes is now tied to that of United States gamers, whether they like it or not. In this case, it's safe to assume not.</p>

			<p>The PvPvE extraction RPG game from Wolcen Studio, currently known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">Project Pantheon</a>, just got a new teaser trailer revealed along with the announcement that Wolcen Studio is hosting a second closed alpha test that interested players can now sign up for.</p>
<p>The test will only last for a little less than a day, beginning on <strong>Friday, April 25, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong> and ending the next day on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, April 26 at 2:59pm PT / 5:59pm ET / 10:59pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Those interested in joining the closed alpha to get an early taste of Project Pantheon can <a href="https://pantheon.firstlook.gg/">sign up for the play test at this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you already participated in the first closed-alpha test for Project Pantheon, you don't have to worry about signing up for this new one. You'll automatically be granted access to it. For everyone else, all you need to do is make sure to register your interest in the play test before <strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>There's a number of new features that play testers will be able to check out, including the player sanctuary now being a "<em>fully 3D navigable hub where players can customize gear, track achievements, and craft runes</em>," the studio says in a press release.</p>
<p>There's also a new dodge roll mechanic, new weapon and gear customizations, new weapons like a new magic weapon simply called "<em>The Staff</em>," new dungeons, a new monster faction to fight in t<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">he Hamförir, and a structured gameplay tutorial to help newcomers get the hang of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of course, there's also a slew of bug fixes<span>&nbsp;and new quality-of-life improvements. For example, a revamped health and shield system, abilities adjusted to feel&nbsp;<em>"snappier,</em>" according to Wolcen Studio, and the overall movement system </span>improved.</p>
<p>If you miss out on this closed alpha, Wolcen Studio currently has two more planned for Project Pantheon after this. The third closed alpha test will arrive sometime in summer 2025, with the fourth coming a bit later in the year in autumn.</p>

But in a post Monday night, YouTube said the restrictions shouldn’t have been applied.</p><p>“Videos featuring <em>Balatro</em> gameplay should not be age-restricted,” YouTube <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1909446185598996790">says in a post on X</a>. We’re reviewing the age-restrictions on these videos and conducting a platform-wide review. Thanks for your patience as we fix!”</p><p>In the video, Balatro University says that 119 of 606 videos were age-restricted, and of the 30 appeals submitted, 24 were rejected. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Balatro University says that YouTube said last night it would remove the age restriction from five of the videos and that it may “remove the age-restrictions from additional videos.”</p><p>“On one hand, progress is slow,” Balatro University tells <em>The Verge</em>. “On the other hand, this is seemingly the fastest YouTube has responded to anything, ever, so I’m thankful for that.”</p><p>YouTube’s X post from last night is a reply to <em>Balatro’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/634123/balatro-localthunk-developer-anonymous-update">anonymous developer</a>, LocalThunk, who shared the Balatro University video <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620740435280288">Monday afternoon</a>. “Good thing we are protecting children from knowing what a 4 of a kind is and letting them watch [<em>Counter-Strike</em>] case opening videos instead,” <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1908620319381717301">LocalThunk said</a>.</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, a roguelike that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">borrows ideas from poker</a>, doesn’t actually involve gambling. But the game received a PEGI 18 rating in Europe after it launched because it “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling,” as quoted by publisher Playstack <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">at the time</a>. LocalThunk also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324626/balatro-localthunk-18-plus-rating-europe-pegi">expressed his displeasure</a> with that rating.</p><p>However, in February, PEGI revised <em>Balatro’s</em> rating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618342/balatro-pegi-rating-appeal">to PEGI 12</a> following an appeal and said it would “develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, April 8th</strong>: Added details from Balatro University.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You know, I'm going to be very real with you right now: I thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-rumble">Sonic Rumble</a> was already out. It feels like I've been hearing about this thing for an eon now, probably because it was leaked a good while before Sega even officially revealed it. And yet here we are, with an announcement from the house of hog (sorry) saying that in actual fact, it's not out until May 8th, exactly a month from now! Perhaps this is a sign that I'm losing track of time, perhaps this is a game that Sega has been cooking in the kitchen for a bit too long. Who's to say!
</p>

<p>
This one's obviously a lot more geared towards kids that say to their parents "can you put Sonic on your phone" given that it'll be available on iOS and Android, but even though it does appear to be skipping out on a console release, it is coming to PC via Steam.

The skins-inclined amongst you - I appreciate this is the worst possible way to put this - might be interested to know that <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3Ddb045d06-e0f8-4d7d-8de3-69c167c330d2">the more wishlists there are</a>, the more goodies you get when the game arrives, like a movie Sonic skin, who honestly looks a bit terrifying.
</p>
<p>
I'm not easily won over by free-to-play games all that much, though I do think the kind of toy vibe Sonic Rumble has is cute. It looks like it's being quite smart about how it folds in that general Sonic feel to its more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque levels too. Seriously though, I like movie Sonic's design, but there's something not right about the Sonic Rumble skin…

<p>When asked about the sequel in a recent interview, the director of ‘A Minecraft Movie’ stated, “It seems like there’s already talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>

Hess stated that the team enjoyed creating this movie; however, the game world is so expansive that “there were so many things” they couldn’t tap into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hess added that he “would have a blast doing the sequel” for the Minecraft movie before stating that he is excited because “it seems like there’s already talk about it happening.” The director added that it would be a lot of fun to dive back into this world, and the audience is also seemingly going ”wild” for their post-credits scene, which hints towards a potential sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hess already has a plan for the characters he will focus on in the sequel. <strong>Spoilers Ahead</strong> for those who haven’t watched the movie, as this references the post-credits scene.</p>



<p>In the post-credits scene of A Minecraft Movie, they teased Alex, an iconic character from the game’s universe. Hess has stated that “it’s Steve (Black) and Alex, and so that’s the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt” for the sequel.</p>
