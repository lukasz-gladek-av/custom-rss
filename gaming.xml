                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games. There will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p>For years, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">has fought with Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">Google</a> in court for the right to expand the Epic Games Store on mobile. The company says that it grew Epic cross-platform accounts to 898 million users during 2024--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-store-sales-on-pc-reached-1-billion-in-2024/1100-6529505/" data-ref-id="1100-6529505">an increase of 94 million people</a>--and this stat includes accounts created through partner platforms and the Epic Games Store. Epic is following in the footsteps of its PC store by trying to attract users with free games.</p><p>Recently, two members of Epic's board of directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-justice-department-investigation-leads-to-board-members-leaving-epic-games/1100-6528567/" data-ref-id="1100-6528567">were forced to step down</a> by the US Justice Department because they were already members of Tencent's board, which the government considers a rival gaming company. Epic is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">suing an alleged cheater</a> whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments.</p>

Miller, the voice of Athena in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Earlier today, Miller </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likgdz5k722f">posted on Bluesky</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that their role may be "recast" by the studio following its alleged decision not to sign the SAG-AFTRA voice actor's interim agreement. The post did not name Supergiant Games directly, but in a follow up post they wrote that it would be "SUPER helpful" if their followers wrote a "GIANT email" asking the studio to "flip" for their actors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now Supergiant Games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o">has responded</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, saying it has not re-cast any characters in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that it hopes to keep working with its "wonderful cast."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This dispute </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike">echoes our December 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reporting on a similar conflict between </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Activision and the cast of the game's Zombies campaign. In both cases, it's been alleged that the studio declined to update their contracts with actors under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements">SAG-AFTRA interim agreement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and as a result the original actors are not reprising their roles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are key differences between the two casting disputes. Activision is a member of the interactive media bargaining group, a collection of studios that collective bargain with the union to cast SAG-AFTRA members in their games. In its statement, Supergiant Games says none of its games have been made under SAG-AFTRA contracts.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">Activision quietly recast Black Ops 6 Zombies actors during SAG-AFTRA strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Miller had been initially cast under a non-union contract and was requesting the studio re-up them under an interim SAG-AFTRA contract, that would be a different situation than the one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Ops 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> actors faced last year.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who protects voice actors from AI and contract violations?">Who protects voice actors from AI and contract violations?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In follow-up posts on Bluesky, Miller offered further insight on why they might turn down a contract from a non-union client even if that client offers robust protections against using their voice for generative AI. They explained that as a union member, they receive legal protection from SAG-AFTRA that can go after any company that decides to violate the terms of a contract. "I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they stated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Miller signed a non-union agreement with a studio that promised not to use their voice for generative AI, but the studio turned around and did so anyway, they would need to pay out of pocket for a lawyer to fight the case.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be clear, Miller does not accuse Supergiant of attempting to use generative AI, and Supergiant vociferously shot down the idea that it would use AI technology. "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them," it wrote. "We offer the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now Miller and the company appear to be at a standstill. The actor stated that they will only work on projects signed to a SAG-AFTRA interim agreement, and Supergiant stated that it "[respects] and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve," it added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear at this time if any other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cast members have made similar requests of the company.

<p>Nvidia's RTX 50-series makes its first foray below the $1,000 mark starting this week, with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti—at least in theory.</p>
<p>The third-fastest card in the Blackwell GPU lineup, the 5070 Ti is still far from "reasonably priced" by historical standards (the 3070 Ti was $599 at launch). But it's also $50 cheaper and a fair bit faster than the outgoing 4070 Ti Super and the older 4070 Ti. These are steps in the right direction, if small ones.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about its performance shortly, but at a high level, the 5070 Ti's performance falls in the same general range as the 4080 Super and the original RTX 4080, a card <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/">that launched for $1,199</a> just over two years ago. And it's probably your floor for consistently playable native 4K gaming for those of you out there who don't want to rely on DLSS or 4K upscaling to hit that resolution (it's also probably all the GPU that most people will need for high-FPS 1440p, if that's more your speed).</p>
<p>But it's a card I'm ambivalent about! It's close to 90 percent as fast as a 5080 for 75 percent of the price, at least if you go by Nvidia's minimum list prices, which for the 5090 and 5080 have been mostly fictional so far. If you can find it at that price—and that's a big "if," since every $749 model is <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=5070+Ti&amp;Order=1">already out of stock across the board at Newegg</a>—and you're desperate to upgrade or are building a brand-new 4K gaming PC, you could do worse. But I wouldn't spend more than $749 on it, and it might be worth waiting to see what AMD's first 90-series Radeon cards look like in a couple weeks before you jump in.</p>

<p>Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version of the 5070 Ti, so this time around our review unit is <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rtx5070ti-16g/">an Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> provided by Asus and Nvidia. These third-party cards will deviate a little from the stock specs listed above, but factory overclocks tend to be inordinately mild, and done mostly so the GPU manufacturer can slap a big "overclocked" badge somewhere on the box. We tested this Asus card with its BIOS switch set to "performance" mode, which elevates the boost clock by an entire 30 MHz; you don't need to be a math whiz to guess that a 1.2 percent overclock is not going to change performance much.</p>
<p>Compared to the 4070 Ti Super, the 5070 Ti brings two things to the table: a roughly 6 percent increase in CUDA cores and a 33 percent increase in memory bandwidth, courtesy of the switch from GDDR6X to GDDR7. The original 4070 Ti had even fewer CUDA cores, but most importantly for its 4K performance included just 12GB of memory on a 192-bit bus.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is based on the same GB203 GPU silicon as the 5080 series, but with 1,792 CUDA cores disabled. But there are a lot of similarities between the two, including the 16GB bank of GDDR7 and the 256-bit memory bus. It looks nothing like the yawning gap between the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080, and the two cards' similar-ish specs meant they weren't too far away from each other in our testing. The 5070 Ti's 300 W power requirement is also a bit lower than the 5080's 360 W, but it's pretty close to the 4080 and 4080 Super's 320 W; in practice, the 5070 Ti draws about as much as the 4080 cards do under load.</p>

<p>As a Blackwell GPU, the 5070 Ti also supports Nvidia's most-hyped addition to the 50-series: support for DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation (MFG). We've already covered this in our 5090 and 5080 reviews, but the short version is that MFG works exactly like Frame Generation did in the 40-series, except that it can now insert up to three AI-generated frames in between natively rendered frames instead of just one.</p>
<p>Especially if you're already running at a reasonably high frame rate, this can make things look a lot smoother on a high-refresh-rate monitor without introducing distractingly excessive lag or weird rendering errors. The feature is mainly controversial because Nvidia is comparing 50-series performance numbers with DLSS MFG enabled to older 40-series cards without DLSS MFG to make the 50-series cards seem a whole lot faster than they actually are.</p>
<p>We'll publish some frame-generation numbers in our review, both using DLSS and (for AMD cards) FSR. But per usual, we'll continue to focus on natively rendered performance—more relevant for all the games out there that don't support frame generation or don't benefit much from it, and more relevant because your base performance dictates how good your generated frames will look and feel anyway.</p>
<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>We tested the 5070 Ti in the same updated testbed and with the same updated suite of games that we started using in our RTX 5090 review. The heart of the build is an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D, ensuring that our numbers are limited as little as possible by the CPU speed.</p>
<p>Per usual, we prioritize testing GPUs at resolutions that we think most people will use them for. For the 5070 Ti, that means both 4K and 1440p—this card is arguably still overkill for 1440p, but if you're trying to hit 144 or 240 Hz (or even more) on a monitor, there's a good case to be made for it. We also use a mix of ray-traced and non-ray-traced games. For the games we test with upscaling enabled, we use DLSS on Nvidia cards and the newest supported version of FSR (usually 2.x or 3.x) for AMD cards.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Though we've tested and re-tested multiple cards with recent drivers in our updated testbed, we don't have a 4070 Ti Super, 4070 Ti, or 3070 Ti available to test with. We've provided some numbers for those GPUs from past reviews; these are from a PC running older drivers and a Ryzen 7 7800X3D instead of a 9800X3D, and we've put asterisks next to them in our charts. They should still paint a reasonably accurate picture of the older GPUs' relative performance, but take them with that small grain of salt.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>Despite including fewer CUDA cores than either version of the 4080, some combination of architectural improvements and memory bandwidth increases help the card keep pace with both 4080 cards almost perfectly. In most of our tests, it landed in the narrow strip right in between the 4080 and the 4080 Super, and its power consumption under load was also almost identical.</p>

                </p>
  </div>

<p>In every way that matters, the 5070 Ti is essentially an RTX 4080 that also supports DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. You can see why we'd be mildly enthusiastic about it at $749 but less and less impressed the closer the price creeps to $1,000.</p>
<p>Being close to a 4080 also means that the performance gap between the 5070 Ti and the 5080 is usually pretty small. In most of the games we tested, the 5070 Ti hovers right around 90 percent of the 5080's performance.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is also around 60 percent as fast as an RTX 5090. The performance is a lot lower, but the price-to-performance ratio is a lot higher, possibly reflecting the fact that the 5070 Ti actually has other GPUs it has to compete with (in non-ray-traced games, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX generally keeps pace with the 5070 Ti, though at this late date it is mostly out of stock unless you're willing to pay way more than you ought to for one).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>Compared to the old 4070 Ti, the 5070 Ti can be between 20 and 50 percent faster at 4K, depending on how limited the game is by the 4070 Ti's narrower memory bus and 12GB bank of RAM. The performance improvement over the 4070 Ti Super is more muted, ranging from as little as 8 percent to as much as 20 percent in our 4K tests. This is better than the RTX 5080 did relative to the RTX 4080 Super, but as a generational leap, it's still pretty modest—it's clear why Nvidia wants everyone to look at the Multi-Frame Generation numbers when making comparisons.</p>

<p>Being able to get RTX 4080-level performance for several hundred dollars less just a couple of years after the 4080 launched is kind of exciting, though that excitement is leavened by the still high-ish $749 price tag (again, assuming it's actually available at or anywhere near that price). That certainly makes it feel more like a next-generation GPU than the RTX 5080 did—and whatever else you can say about it, the 5070 Ti certainly feels like a better buy than the 5080.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is a fast and 4K-capable graphics card, fast enough that you should be able to get some good results from all of Blackwell's new frame-generation trickery if that's something you want to play with. Its price-to-performance ratio does not thrill me, but if you do the math, it's still a much better value than the 4070 Ti series was—particularly the original 4070 Ti, with the 12GB allotment of RAM that limited its usefulness and future-proofness at 4K.</p>
<p>Two reasons to hold off on buying a 5070 Ti, if you're thinking about it: We're waiting to see how AMD's 9070 series GPUs shake out, and Nvidia's 50-series launch so far has been kind of a mess, with low availability and price gouging both on retail sites and in the secondhand market. Pay much <em>more</em> than $749 for a 5070 Ti, and its delicate value proposition fades quickly. We should know more about the AMD cards in a couple of weeks. The supply situation, at least so far, seems like a problem that Nvidia can't (or won't) figure out how to solve.</p>

<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a starting price of $749, you get the approximate performance and power consumption of an RTX 4080, a GPU that cost $1,199 two years ago and $999 one year ago.</li>
<li>Good 4K performance and great 1440p performance for those with high-refresh monitors.</li>
<li>16GB of RAM should be reasonably future-proof.</li>
<li>Multi-Frame Generation is an interesting performance-boosting tool to have in your toolbox, even if it isn't a cure-all for low framerates.</li>
<li>Nvidia-specific benefits like DLSS support and CUDA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not all that much faster than a 4070 Ti Super.</li>
<li>$749 looks cheap compared to a $2,000 GPU, but it's still enough money to buy a high-end game console or an entire 1080p gaming PC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pricing and availability for other 50-series GPUs to date have both been kind of a mess.</li>
<li>Will you actually be able to get it for $749? Because it doesn't make a ton of sense if it costs more than $749.</li>
<li>Seriously, it's been months since I reviewed a GPU that was actually widely available at its advertised price.</li>
<li>And it's not just the RTX 5090 or 5080, it's low-end stuff like the Intel Arc B580 and B570, too.</li>
<li>Is it high demand? Low supply? Scalpers and resellers hanging off the GPU market like the parasites they are? No one can say!</li>
<li>It makes these reviews very hard to do.</li>
<li>It also makes PC gaming, as a hobby, really difficult to get into if you aren't into it already!</li>
<li>It just makes me mad is all.</li>
<li>If you're reading this months from now and the GPUs actually&nbsp;<em>are</em> in stock at the list price, I hope this was helpful.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced a new company business strategy. The toy and tabletop company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and Dungeons &amp; Dragons has announced Playing to Win, a strategy that will focus more on play-fueled franchises and ongoing partnerships.</p>

<h2>The Hasbro Playing to Win Strategy Announcement</h2>

<p>Hasbro's Playing to Win strategy was announced alongside their <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/32a267bf-241b-4541-91ab-7745ed17693d" rel="nofollow">Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Report</a>. In that report, Hasbro CEO, and AI advocate, Chris Cocks discussed areas of growth, revenue, and decline for the various IPs and studios under Hasbro's umbrella.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=xeMIvhOF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=bA-f6-5N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the major areas of growth was the franchises under the stewardship of Wizards of the Coast. Both WOTC and Digital games were up 4% YoY courtesy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Monopoly Go, </em>and strong ongoing sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cocks even stated that <em>Magic's</em> ecosystem remains "as healthy and engaged" as it has ever been thanks to strong set sales and Secret Lairs.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> also showed ongoing growth. The new 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Player's Handbook</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and brand-new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/2024-monster-manual-review-we-take-look-at-some-of-dds-most-well-known-monsters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Manual</em></a> have been breaking sales records for the best-selling D&amp;D books ever as well as increased digital revenue through the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace.</p>

<p>Notably, while analog sales of Wizards products were down by 16%, digital sales were up 3% and digital licensing was up 7%. This does align with the rise of online TTRPG play over physical book purchases and WOTC's own investment in their own D&amp;D-focused virtual tabletop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sigil</a>.</p>

<p>Within this financial report, Cocks discussed Hasbro's Playing to Win business strategy. Simply put, the plan involves Hasbro investing hard on their play-first franchises and partnerships, increasing play and appeal to older fans, expanding reach to emerging markets, and building more videogames with their IP.</p>

<p>The first part of this strategy is self-evident in Hasbro's toylines. Their toy robot franchise, <em>Transformers</em>, continues to sell to its target demographic of children, bolstered by the recent <em>Transformers One</em> feature film.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=hMFKzq4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=DjYRirT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for partnerships, the company has plenty. In addition to the recent <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crossover with <em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, the popular card game will be crossing over with Marvel's Spider-Man in 2025 alongside a third unannounced Universes Beyond set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expanding their reach to emerging markets are covered with the recently announced <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie coming courtesy of Legendary Pictures and a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> TV show by Netflix and executive producer Shawn Levy.</p>

<p>Finally, building new videogames based on Hasbro's IP aligns with the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive is working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new AAA game</a> based on a Hasbro franchise. Given Space Marine 2's gameplay is full of high-octane action, there's a strong chance this game will align with Hasbro's appeal to older fans.</p>

<p>In short, the Playing to Win strategy seems to be the company leaning more into digital sales, leveraging partnerships with other studios for multimedia projects, and investing in their bestselling franchises.</p>

            <p>
Developer MachineGames' steady finessing of last year's stellar <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> continues today with the launch a third major update for the acclaimed third-person action-adventure. This time around, there's support for a range of new graphics features on PC - including DLSS 4 - as well as the usually array of bug fixes and more.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those graphics features, there's that DLSS 4 support, giving PC players access to the likes of transformer-based Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and updated versions of DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution - provided their hardware supports them.
</p>
<p>
Update 3 also includes a new option for ray-traced shadows that utilises all light sources within a player's surroundings (as opposed to just the sun) when Path Tracing is enabled. Additionally, Path Tracing is now available on Intel and AMD GPUs, and there's support for AMD 3.1 upscaling and frame generation, as well as Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.

<p>
Away from the PC-specific new features, all platforms get an <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/19eQtJoGEbNeavznlgvNMH/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3">extensive helping of quality of life improvements and bug fixes</a>. Repair kits can, for instance, now be used directly from the inventory, rather than only after selecting a broken weapon or tool.
</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, other than Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's still undated PS5 release, MachineGames says Nvidia RTX hair support is coming in a future update, and it's also looking into adding support for community requested features such as HUD modification.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you've read all this and somehow still don't know what an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is, allow me to point you toward <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's five star review</a>, which called it a "stealth action tour de force" and a "bold new era for MachineGames". That was before we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">crowned it our Game of 2024</a> too. And finally, Update 3's patch notes (spoilers ahead):

<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would repeat her lines from the ambush (“That was too close”) while you are in the boat. Please note this will, unfortunately, not correct the issue for players who are currently experiencing the bug, but it will prevent it from happening again</li>
<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>
<li>Raised the volume of the enemy mounted machineguns in Sukhothai hotel shootout</li>

                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms. The note also states that the developers want the game "to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318" data-ratio="1" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318"></a><figcaption>The complete message from Tales of the Shire developers Private Division and Wētā Workshop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg"></figure><p>There will be no epic quests or ring-tossing into Mount Doom in this game. Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures. Truthfully, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins--as well Sam, Pippin, and Merry--were always outliers among their people. Most of the Hobbits prefer to stay at home in the Shire.</p><p>This game will allow players to create their own Hobbit character, and put together a beautiful home for them. Players can also enjoy simple Hobbit tasks like farming, gardening, decorating, and trading for rare items with fellow residents of the Shire.</p><p>Tales of the Shire will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC .

Hopefully the final version of the game will deliver those adjustments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-tentpole-aaa-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hasbro and Saber Interactive have announced a new partnership to develop a new AAA game from one of the toy giant’s “tentpole IPs”.</p>
<p>Given how big Hasbro is and how many toy ranges and properties they produced, that could be pretty much anything. Hasbro owns Dungeon &amp; Dragons, Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, GI Joe, Battleship, Risk, Jenga, and so, so much more.</p>


<p>Of course, Saber is now best known for their excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which launched to plenty critical and fan praise last year, and their surprising World War Z adaptation before then. We know their strengths as developers, and the technical prowess of their game engine to throw hundreds or thousands of individual enemies around on screen. It was great when used for a zombie shooter, and the perfect for depicting the Tyranids of 40K.</p>
<p>“We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I’m especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team’s games,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said in an earnings call. “Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024’s megahit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber’s Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.”</p>
<p>Joining all of the dots, the answer’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Saber is clearly making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/25/larian-boss-says-wizards-of-the-coast-not-to-blame-for-them-moving-on-from-baldurs-gate/">Baldur’s Gate 4</a>.</p>
<p>(Actually my money is on Transformers)</p>
<p>Answering questions, Cocks said that this would be a co-publishing deal, and that it’s specifically tapping the Space Marine 2 team to make the game – which was developed by the company’s main studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This sadly seems to reduce the odds of a Space Marine 3 happening, unless that project is already underway and the Hasbro collaboration scheduled to come after that.</p>

(Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy.

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6’s Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that’s cool,” Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today’s newly revealed Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there’s no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since. However, in 2020, fans received the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Pro Skater 1 + 2 remakes</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">Vicarious Visions</a>. That means it’s been five years since a Tony Hawk game hit store shelves. With so much evidence lining up for a big reveal next month, it seems the wait may soon be over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see what that March 4 reveal has lined up, you can read up on a few of the other skateboarding-themed inclusions in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Reloaded, including a pack of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cosmetics that have some fans upset</a>.

Although there are a handful of crash fixes, there aren't many major issues at all in this patch, which Warhorse is calling Hotfix 1.1.2. Instead, the most exciting revision comes in The King's Gambit, where players can now keep the wine flowing for the king.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1imfa12/kcd2_cant_pick_up_white_wine_during_the_kings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, some players ran into an issue in The King's Gambit where the option to pour wine for the king disappears. When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-had-a-huge-weekend-on-steam-and-it-may-get-even-bigger/1100-6529355/" data-ref-id="1100-6529355">peaked at 250,000 concurrent users</a> on Steam. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-mods-are-coming-get-a-first-peek-with-henry-holding-a-fish/1100-6529434/" data-ref-id="1100-6529434">official mod support is coming</a> to the PC version of the game as well.</p><p>Players have also found entertaining details in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-a-secret-ending-you-only-see-if-youre-the-worst-person-ever/1100-6529439/" data-ref-id="1100-6529439">a hidden ending</a> that can only be achieved by letting the main character embrace all of his worst instincts. The complete patch notes for Hotfix 1.1.2 are reproduced below.</p><h3><strong>Fortuna </strong></h3><ul><li>Bozhena and Pavlena will no longer report the player for crimes during the quest.</li></ul><h3><strong>The King's Gambit </strong></h3><ul><li>The quest interactor for wine will no longer disappear, allowing players to continue pouring wine for the guests.</li></ul><h3><strong>Combat</strong></h3><ul><li>Fixed the crossbow aiming zoom on ultrawide resolutions.</li></ul><h3><strong>Platform-specific fixes</strong></h3><ul><li>Epic Games Store: Fixed the issue with achievements not being completed after longer than one hour of play.</li></ul><h3><strong>PROS</strong></h3><ul><li>Improved the issue with rewards sometimes requiring game restart to be awarded.</li></ul><h3><strong>Stability</strong></h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash when looking at certain locked doors and chests.</li><li>Fixed a crash sometimes occurring loading the game after finishing the dice mini-game.</li><li>Fixed a crash related to opening the horse inventory.</li><li>Fixed a crash related to interacting with a cart.</li><li>Fixed a crash when spamming keys on the EULA screen.</li><li>Fixed a crash when having conflicting versions of the Bink library.</li><li>A few dozen additional stability fixes and improvements.</li></ul>

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other. However, It Takes Two had cross-gen play, meaning that PS4 and PS5 players and Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players could play with each other as long as they were on the same platform family.</p><p>Split Fiction is only on current-gen consoles, so cross-gen play doesn't exist. However, Split Fiction now offers cross-play, meaning that PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S players can all play together. Cross-play requires both players to sign up for separate EA accounts each, which you can <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">make for free</a>.</p><p>Hazelight also has a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hazelight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a> with a channel called "Looking for Player" for those who want to play Split Fiction with but don't have anyone available to arrange game sessions.</p><p>Split Fiction launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In other related news, director Josef Fares recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-and-split-fiction-director-shares-his-thoughts-on-ai/1100-6529493/" data-ref-id="1100-6529493">shared his thoughts on AI</a>, and also said that Hazelight Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-boss-says-studio-will-never-make-a-live-service-game/1100-6529501/" data-ref-id="1100-6529501">will never make a live-service game</a>.</p><p>For more Split Fiction coverage, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/split-fiction-is-shaping-up-to-be-another-great-co-op-adventure-hands-on-impressions/2300-6465704/" data-ref-id="2300-6465704">Split Fiction preview</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | How to Invite a Friend for Free with the Friend's Pass" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>
