			<p>After reading The Lord of the Rings, the last thing on my mind was wanting to be a Hobbit. No, I categorically wanted to be Legolas, growing my hair and joining the University Archery Society, spending a year enjoying the fine art of putting arrows in a massive circle. If I couldn’t be Legolas, though, then it would have been Strider, and then probably Gimli or Gandalf in that order. Frodo and Sam might be the ostensible heroes, but as the everyman they’re not… well… very cool, are they? And frankly, my own feet are hairy enough already.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of the Shire | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XabBAJdc964?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, as an adult person, with adult constraints, tasks and responsibilities, the Hobbits’ way of life is far more alluring than the detached, changeable, emotionally reserved elves. Here we have a race that has made elevenses a religion, whose pantries are always full, and who can nap, eat and smoke at any time of day without anyone raising an eyebrow.</p>


<p>Their beautifully decorated underground homes are also warm, cosy and ever so appealing – even more so with the state of the current real-world housing market. This is the perfect time then to discover Tales of the Shire, a cosy life sim that lets you become the Hobbit of your dreams, and there’s not an adventure in sight.</p>
<p>You’ve got to give a suitably Hobbity name to your Hobbit, and thankfully, there’s a range of pre-made ones to mix and match from if you don’t quite feel as creative as Tolkien. Enter Odo Lightfoot, or maybe Myrtle Mugwort. It’s interesting to find a game where the character creator has as many options for foot hair as it does for hair on your head, but overall, this is a limited character creator compared to most. Still, you can make a fair approximation of Sam, Frodo, Merry or Pippin, and that’s probably the important thing.</p>


<p>Your first task is to become a local of Bywater. This Hobbit town is made mention of in the series as a crucial location in the fight back against Saruman, but there’s no sign of vindictive wizards here, just an array of green pastures, blooming flowers and one rundown Hobbit Hole for you to bring back to life.</p>
<p>Food is the key to a Hobbit’s heart, and that’s as true as ever here. Progress is fundamentally tied to making meals, sharing them with townsfolk, and levelling up your relationship with each of them through bribery-based friendship. The better your ingredients, the better your meals, and you go through a short series of tasks to prepare each one. These are pretty simple, but they do make you feel slightly more like a cook than someone clicking through menus.</p>
<p>Things are complicated by each dish’s sweet spot. You have to prepare and cook dishes to a particular level, with a scale between smooth and chunky, between tender and crisp, and if you manage to do that, alternating in how much you chop or cook each component, you’ll make your dish much tastier, greatly increasing its impact on the diner.</p>

<p>I particularly like some of the little touches the team have included, like the birds that serve as your route finders, fluttering from signpost to arch to wall as you go about your business. It’s such a smart and natural way to direct your play that I wonder why I haven’t seen it before – the closest might be the wind blowing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>
<p>One of the other key things you’ll spend your time doing, is tidying, designing and expanding your Hobbit Hole. It’s a bit of a wreck when you arrive, and the first thing you’ll want to do is clear up. Thankfully, this is very well done, and the controls are clear and easy to use, making moving, rotating and setting items pleasingly easy.</p>
<p>It’s also very detailed, so you can place mugs and bottles on shelves or the floor, filling places with clutter if you want, or going for a new-age Hobbit Feng Shui where everything points in the right direction. I do wish there were a gyro option on Switch, for a perfect level of precision, but it works suitably well without.</p>

<p>The Switch version A Hobbit’s Tale looks distinctly pared back, and frankly, it’s a little ugly. The character models look less detailed, and there’s clear pop-in of level furniture, with flowers and other details magically appearing as you walk towards them. What it does mean is that everything runs relatively smoothly, and the overall presentation remains charming, but it’s definitely not a looker on the older handheld, and it’s limited to compatibility modes on the Switch 2 – hopefully a patch or upgrade is forthcoming.</p>
<p>A further disappointment is that there’s no recorded speech, and only minimal grunts and exclamations made by characters during conversation. It gives every encounter a strange silence, a disconnect, and it really robs speech of any emotional depth at all. Even if it was shorter portions of speech that give a flavour of the full written dialogue – like we’ve seen in series like Fire Emblem – that would have breathed so much more life into the characters here.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the beautiful soundtrack helps to draw your attention away from any other audio/visual deficiencies. It manages to capture the nature of the films, with finely drawn, gentle orchestration emphasising the arable fantasy, letting you truly embody the Hobbit way of life. It’s about as perfectly tuned to its task as possible, and while you’re cooking, cleaning, renovating and removing, it provides an excellent aural backdrop.</p>

<p>Now, Tales of the Shire is going to appeal to a very particular sort of person. Some might decry the limited Lord of the Rings connections – at least those who expect to be walloping orcs with swords – but there’s a heap of Animal Crossing here, alongside some Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons, wrapped up in a thoroughly convincing Lord of the Rings landscape. For fans of cosy gaming, those for whom a busy little fantasy life is what they want at the end of a day, rather than a grand adventure, Tales of the Shire is a gentle and lovingly crafted entry in the genre.</p>

			<p>The Astronauts, the studio behind early access first-person fantasy shooter Witchfire, have released the latest major update for the game, Webgrave, which adds an entire new region to explore called Velmorne, new weapons and gear for players hunt the Witch with, changes to player onboarding, quality of life improvements, and more. </p>



<p>A new trailer showcasing the update has also been debuted, going through several of the changes included in the update, mainly around how player progression and build crafting work in the update. Which is great for returning players, but for new players, and even some returning ones, the arrival of a new in-depth tutorial set on a new map before you're dropped into Hermitory is perhaps the biggest highlight of the update. </p>



<p>What's definitely a welcome feature for returning players is the introduction of a new difficulty level, Gnosis VI, to raise the stakes even higher if you've already found yourself running through Witchfire's challenges without issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Witchfire was first launched into early access on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/">Epic Games Store in 2023</a>, and then on Steam in <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/">September 2024</a>. The studio has continually updated and tweaked the game in response to feedback from players, and in a press release for today's update, The Astronauts co-founder and creative director, Adrian Chmielarz, thanked players for taking that journey with the studio.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to our early adopters! To all of you who have participated in our Early Access so far: Thank you very much for your help in getting us to this point</em>,<em>" </em>Chmielarz said. "<em>Your feedback in our official Discord and beyond has been vital!"</em></p>



<p>Witchfire will have been in early access for two years this coming September. Now that the game is getting a proper tutorial as part of this expansion, and an overhaul to its weapons and ability systems, it'll be interesting to see if we finally get word of a 1.0 release coming sometime next year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-shire-review-can-you-relax-too-much</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-review-cozy-lotr-fun-with-big-problems.1255179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hobbits from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> universe, Middle-earth, have what could be the coziest lifestyle ever created, and <em>Tales of the Shire</em> attempts to bring that relaxation to the masses with one of the most relaxing, play-at-your-own-pace games to release in a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the calm and surprisingly deep atmosphere, fun yet simple gameplay loops, and in-depth customization are held back from shining like the star it should be in a few unfortunate areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hobbits are creatures who spend their days with life’s simplest comforts, and they’re incredibly fond of food. Players start the game as a new Hobbit in an area called Bywater, an already-established part of the Shire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=i95Tr6NB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=76neaal- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nature is beautiful and bountiful in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>After they arrive in Bywater, preparations begin to try to establish the area as its own Village. To do this, an appraiser will need to verify its status. This results in a variety of different quests and, ultimately, waiting around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this, players are able to grow closer to the other Hobbits through cooking and hosting meals. To prepare for these meals, players have to forage, fish, and farm for ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> Cooking Is a Cut Above</h2>

<p>Cooking is easily the focal point of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40e0d549-a81e-46b9-9977-4f4a7267b6d2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>, and its depth attests to that. Everything from picking combinations of flavors and seasonings in ingredients to using a variety of kitchen tools to achieve the perfect texture is satisfying, especially when you finally achieve exactly what you’re trying to make seasoned to perfection.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=rX8TQ0Fu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=bujPXldJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>includes balancing different flavors and textures to create the best meal you can.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the meal sharing isn’t as straightforward as it should be. What should happen is that players write letters to Hobbits to invite them to a meal. The next day, the Hobbit will write back what they’re craving that day for a meal, and players make the meal and start the event whenever they want during the day.</p>

<p>As a reward for a meal well done, Hobbits will share recipes with the player.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem that caused the game to crash after most of the meals I tried to host that weren’t part of the main story. To get around it, I had to ignore the meals that I planned, which ended up with some Hobbits who are surprisingly good at holding grudges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developers are working on ironing out problems before <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d2f5f5b9-19dc-4f88-ba82-0aecd6ac2014" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> launches, so this could be solved by the time the game is released. However, it was something that had a pretty big impact on reviewing the game since I couldn’t get too close to the other Hobbits or unlock as many recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=AlYjN6od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=EHbQgHFs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sharing meals with other Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>&nbsp;should be a fun experience, though bugs made it a feature I could barely use.</figcaption></figure><p>Besides that, the cooking system sets the tone of the game well. Yes, Hobbits have cravings and want specific flavors, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> isn’t about perfection. The Hobbits of Bywater are happy to have a meal together, so long as they don’t hate the food, so things don’t have to be perfect.</p>

<p>It’s a small nod to the fact that nothing in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> asks for perfection and rigid solutions. Everything in the game is fluid and requires little to no hustling, and players get to see this from the very start. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Foraging, Fishing, and Farming Are Also Well Done</h2>

<p>While it’s hard to get too excited about foraging every single day, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> makes it surprisingly easy and entertaining enough. Traveling around the map for missions (whether you’re skipping around or walking at a relaxing pace) means passing by quite a few&nbsp;ingredients. It’s very easy to pick these up as you go.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=tn_lF1Dk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=TosMcuS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>fishing is easier than in many similar games, but complex enough to keep players interested.</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is also pretty relaxing. The actual fishing minigame isn’t too difficult, but it’s just hard enough to make sure the player needs to pay attention. Compared to other games in the genre, it’s a balance that works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farming in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is a bit more in-depth than the other systems. Growing plants vary by season, like most farming-sim players would expect. However, a unique twist comes with how plants are grouped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planting can be done freely in various farming spots. By planting an assortment of plants that get along with each other, players can speed up the process and harvest higher-quality plants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Hobbit Holes Are Truly the Coziest Homes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=O6zLwY4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=usktinAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are quite a few gorgeous home customization option in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, like these planters and ceiling wallpaper.</figcaption></figure><p>Part of living the Hobbit life is living in a Hobbit hole. In <em>Tales of the Shire</em>, the player’s Hobbit hole can be customized in a near-endless way. Players can tailor every part of the home to their desires, including minute details like the rafters, the transitional flooring, and the chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you play more, the home expands until the Hobbit hole is a sprawling burrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of it all, there’s a ton of furniture to gather from other Hobbits and from the furniture store in town. Not only is it all pretty stylish, but it can be placed and rotated freely in the home. This includes furniture for outside and the gardening areas, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the furniture comes from around Middle-earth. Finding various Mirkwood pieces for my Hobbit home was a pleasant surprise, and it felt like small easter eggs for Middle-earth lovers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Max Relaxation Doesn’t Fit Everyone’s Playstyle, Though</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=cTt58TOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=9S8_TRyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The writing in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was as quirky as one would expect from Hobbits.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tales of the Shire</em> capitalizes on the fact that some people want to sit back with a game and relax. There are very few time constraints – even the events of each day aren’t dictated by times – and players can take everything slowly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, it’s easy to feel like you’re playing a waiting game. However, the bigger idea is to slow down and enjoy the small parts of the game, which is truly the way of the Hobbits with foraging, farming, and fishing (and, of course, cooking).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that regard, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> really shines. It truly feels like you’re living the life of a Hobbit. Things like quirky dialogue and random events players can run into while running around the map are really well done.</p>

<p>However, this is held back by a few things. Beyond quests, it’s almost pointless to interact with NPCs at random. Players can talk to some NPCs at random, but there are no interactions and no meaningful dialogue that happens by doing so. It made the actual Hobbits feel a bit hollow.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=4rHBwr9_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=jGWmnZV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villagers in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>have potential, but they're hollow shells unless they're talking in the main story.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also held back by several crashing problems. Talking to different Hobbits just to turn in quests would crash the game more often than not. This problem is supposed to be resolved before launch, but it’s worth noting that it caused a significant problem for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tales of the Shire Needs Work, But Has a Solid Foundation</h2>

<p>Overall, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d95816c7-fd28-4045-9e01-20d255217d3c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> offers a niche, yet lovely, experience if you can get past the bugs and you enjoy a more fluid, cozy gaming experience. For those who love Hobbits or Middle-earth, it’s a wonderful, cozy game that expands on the calm lifestyle of Hobbits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a lot to enjoy, from the core gameplay to the small details like dialogue. However, it’s easy to feel dragged down by the larger stability problems.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you’re hopping into the latest Soulslike to hit players in the head with a sneak attack, then you’ll want to know how levelling works in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. While it bears some similarities to games you’re likely more familiar with, like Dark Souls, it has enough little quirks that we think it’s worth going into the specifics to make sure you know what you’re getting into.</p>


<p>As with so many of these games, you will be collecting a single currency called Red Mercury. In its base form, you can spend on items and whatnot from different merchants. However, to level up, you need to refine it into Red Mercury Essence. These are sort of like your stat points, and you can spend them in the Impetus Repository at the shrines you rest at, to unlock different skills.</p>


<p>The first time you open this, it’ll seem very bare. This is because skills are tied to different weapon skill trees. Each of the weapons in the game has a specific tree you can follow that not only unlocks better mastery with that weapon, but also stats relevant to that weapon as well. For example, the one-handed sword tree lets you boost your magic stat and your feathering stat.</p>


<p>It’s worth exploring the different weapon types at least a little bit, because each of them has a different combination of stats to it, but also some of the passives are game-changing when it comes ot how you play the game.</p>
<p>Never feel bad for exploring either, because you can actually reset your invested points whenever you want with no actual penalty. That’s a huge deal in games like this, because the chances are you’re not going to know exactly what play style you’ll actually like until you’ve been playing for a little while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Glen Schofield is a name that horror video game fans have known since the arrival of the first Dead Space game in 2008. He's credited as the creator of the series, and even though he spent some time away from horror during his Call of Duty days in the 2010s, it's clear he was always pulled to the genre since he tried to return to it with The Callisto Protocol in 2022. He's worked in the video game industry for over two decades, with most of that time spent in AAA games. Now, he thinks it might all be coming to an end. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), Schofield ponders on the fact that he might have directed his last game when The Callisto Protocol released nearly three years ago now. He talks about what he's been doing for the last eight months, and how he has tried, and been unsuccessful, in finding appropriate financial backing for a project he's been developing with his daughter, who is also a game developer and has worked as an artist in games for the last eight years.</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past eight months, I've been quietly working with my daughter, Nicole, on a new game idea. She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more</em>," Schofield writes. </p>



<p>"<em>We pulled the budget down to $17 million, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of 2nd and 3rd meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10M.' Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5M.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap...I've worked on games of every size. From 2 of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So I'm back to my art. I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so thank you for playing my games</em>."</p>



<p>Schofield also added that the members of the team he and his daughter were working with to develop this early concept horror project are all looking for work, and that his daughter was also one of the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">caught up in the layoffs</a> suffered by Striking Distance Studios, the company that Schofield and others founded back in 2020. SDS also seems to have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">cancelled a project it was working on</a>.</p>



<p>The video game industry is in a tough place at the moment, no doubt about that. Schofield has been around the AAA block more than a few times now, and if this is his sign to hang it up and take early retirement, then it'll have been unfortunate for him to hang up the gloves on a final game like Callisto Protocol.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-wireless-fight-stick-officially-named-flexstrike-launching-2026.1255146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation has revealed the name and release window of its upcoming wireless arcade fight stick: it's called the FlexStrike, and it's launching sometime next year.</p>

<p>The FlexStrike was first revealed under the codename Project Defiant back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's summer State of Play</a>, but it's now shedding its development moniker. What's more, Sony has revealed more about what you can actually expect from the peripheral.</p>

<p>It'll be compatible with both PS5 and PC, and you'll be able to use it with both via a wired connection or wirelessly (using the included PlayStation Link adapter, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=HXRoyRYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=NccehqMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The FlexStrike is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>On the technical side, you can expect "mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates", which include "square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates" you can slot into the storage compartments alongside the aforementioned PlayStation Link adapter.</p>

<p>You'll be able to hook both the FlexStrike and a Pulse 3D headset, or the Pulse Explore earbuds, up to your PS5 using a single PS Link adapter, and you can even connect two FlexStrikes up with the same adapter if you want to battle alongside (or against) a friend.</p>

<p>If you're not looking to use the FlexStrike to wander through game menus, you can keep your PS5 controller connected while you're using it, and since the FlexStrike features the same button inputs as a DualSense, you can probably use it as a standard controller as well, if you're so inclined.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off what the FlexStrike can do and what kind of aesthetic it's sporting (hint: it's pretty similar to the PS5's design) right here.</p>




<p>If you're lucky enough to be attending Evo in Vegas next month, you'll be able to get a first look at the FlexStrike. The rest of us will have to wait until 2026, and we'll presumably learn more about pricing and release dates in the coming months.</p>

As such, I chose to focus on the Longsword skill tree due to its strong potential for stunning enemies and dealing reasonably fast damage compared to heavier weapons you may discover in the first few areas. If you find that you prefer a different weapon a few hours into the game, rest assured there are comparable skills early in their skill trees, too. </p><h2 id="h157887"><a id=""></a>Skyborn Call I</h2><p>Skyborn Call I is the node located directly to the left of Illusive, which is unlocked by default. </p><p>This skill will increase your maximum Skyborn Might charges by one. Since Skyborn Might is among the most important parts of your kit, you’ll want to grab this one as soon as possible. With more Skyborn Might at your disposal, you can use magic more often (as well as wield stronger spells) or unleash multiple powerful melee skills in a row.</p><h2 id="h157888"><a id=""></a>Manna Capacity &amp; Manna Potency</h2><p>Manna Capacity and Manna Potency nodes are located directly above and below Skyborn Call I, respectively. </p><p>These skills do exactly what you’d expect: increase your Manna Vase’s number of uses and healing power. But they don’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need special items found while exploring: Forgotten Remembrance and Lost Remains. You can find quite a few of these throughout your adventure, but I pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126">two early locations in our beginning tips guide</a></span>.

Since this combo is quick and easy to pull off, it makes for an excellent early pickup to ensure that you can keep stacks of Skyborn Might rolling in consistently. You’ll be especially happy to have this once you combine it with the skill below.</p><h2 id="h157890"><a id=""></a>Windforce</h2><p>Windforce is a node located in the Longsword tree purchaseable after buying Sword Saint and two Strength upgrades.</p><p>This skill allows you to use a charged heavy attack much more quickly if you have a stack of Skyborn Might. Thanks to Sword Saint helping you consistently build stacks alongside any you get from dodging well, you can pull off these charged heavy attacks with frequency. Doing so will let you stun enemies for critical attacks more quickly, with it being especially effective against small-to-medium-sized human foes. </p><h2 id="h157891"><a id=""></a>Strong Blade</h2><p>Strong Blade nodes are located in the Longsword tree that can be found on either side of Windforce after buying an adjacent node (either Vitality or Endurance).</p><figure id="" data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Regardless of which node you choose, this skill will level up the mastery of the Longsword and increase its damage. But it doesn’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need Faint Red Feathers, which you’ll find by exploring thoroughly and defeating specific enemies. One example is a little creature in a jar that spits poison at you. They’re often found down optional pathways or lurking in corners among debris. </p><p>You’ll find more Strong Blade nodes throughout the skill tree as well, each offering three tiers of upgrades (meaning three upgrades per node), so you’ll get more chances to increase the damage of your weapon as you venture further into the game. As you level these higher, however, you’ll need more advanced upgrade materials (feathers). </p><hr><p><br><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-longsword-skills-strong-blade-windforce-1851787137]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">One of the issues the game has experienced so far is related to preorder bonuses, as an update released on July 25 did not properly distribute these bonuses to all players. As compensation for this, those who own the deluxe-edition of the game on Steam will be getting three extra sets of deluxe costumes and four weapons, and both standard- and deluxe-edition owners will get three headgear items on all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the game's performance and optimization issues, Leenzee explained that it will "continue to optimize performance issues and will keep adjusting the game based on your suggestions--such as difficulty levels and boss encounters--in upcoming patches." It outlined a preview of some of its "recent optimization efforts," which include things like crash fixes, improved frame rates and reduced lag on certain graphics cards, improved AI logic for monsters and bosses, enhanced texture quality in low-resolution areas, and improved asset detail and precision in some regions.</p><p dir="ltr">Leenzee closed out the post by asking "for your patience as we tackle these optimizations step by step."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious as to whether the game is worth checking out despite these performance issues, check out or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-aint-nuthing-ta-pluck-with/1900-6418385/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a>.</p>

            <p>Laura Bailey, who portrayed Abby in Part 2, has called Kaitlyn Dever "phenomenal" following The Last of Us' second season.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2 (the game) initially released back in 2020, and Bailey went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2020-live-report">win the Best Performance accolade at the Game Awards for her portrayal of Abby</a>. Now, another actress has taken on the role, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">Dever portraying Abby in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, which recently ended its second season.</p>
<p>"She's just phenomenal, every moment that I saw that she was in, I just loved how much she brought to the character and made it her own," <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-laura-bailey-reacts-kaitlyn-dever-abby-exclusive-11778801">Bailey said of Dever's performance on the show</a>.</p>

<p>Bailey likened seeing Dever on screen in The Last of Us season two as "like watching your child get up and start walking" for the first time. "Once you put it out there it's somebody else's and she's just embraced it," Bailey said.</p>
<p>She added she had recently had lunch with The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann, saying she told him "how happy [she] was with everything that [Dever] did" on the show. And it is not just Bailey who is evidently impressed by Dever's take on Abby, with her portrayal in The Last of Us' second season <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-lands-another-16-emmy-nominations-bringing-series-total-to-40">recently securing her an Emmy nomination</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the series showrunners confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-where-season-three-will-go">Abby will return for season three of The Last of Us</a>. One person who will not be returning to the show, though, is Druckmann, who earlier this month announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">he was stepping away from HBO's The Last of Us adaptation to bring his full attention back to Naughty Dog</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Reflecting on this change, Bella Ramsey - who plays Ellie on the show - has admitted this will be an adjustment for sure, but the series will still have Druckmann's influence even though he won't be "actively involved" in season three.</p>
<p>"The world of The Last of Us is his creation and so his voice and creative input," Ramsey said during a recent conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/the-last-of-us-bella-ramsey-season-3-neil-druckmann-emmys-1236470903/">Variety</a>. "It doesn't just go away in season three because he's not as actively involved." Ramsey added that, even if he isn't on set, The Last of Us will "always" be Druckmann's "creation".</p>
<p>"And we're always in everything that we do, honouring the game and Neil's creation," they closed. "He'll definitely be missed on set. But his spirit is the story."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Earlier this month, HBO confirmed the third season of The Last of Us is slated for release in 2027. While there had previously been chatter about a potential fourth season, the third may in fact be the last.</p>
<p>"[Showrunner Craig Mazin] is still working out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-boss-not-worried-about-the-last-of-us-without-neil-druckmann-as-season-three-gets-2027-release-window">HBO's CEO Casey Bloy said at the time</a>. "It hasn't been decided yet, and I'm following Craig's lead on that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-calls-kaitlyn-dever-phenomenal-while-bella-ramsey-says-neil-druckmann-still-has-an-impact-on-season-three]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-%E2%80%9Chave-confidence-in-trusted-age-rating-systems%E2%80%9D-in-response-to-adult-games-removed-from-steam-and-itch-io.1255098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>UKIE, the United Kingdom video game industry trade body, has put out a statement in response to adult games being removed on Steam and Itch.io. </p>



<p>Payment processing partners have been pressuring Itch.io and Valve regarding the adult content available on both platforms. Itch.io "<em><a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">deindexed</a></em>" all adult and NSFW content on its platform last week in response to pressure from payment processing partners and Collective Shout. Valve also <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1945409792207421900">pulled several adult games</a> from its platform earlier this month and<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/"> changed its publishing guidelines</a> to accommodate new policies from processors.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ukie-responds-to-adult-games-being-pulled-from-steam-and-itchio-after-pressure-from-payment-providers">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, UKIE is telling PayPal and other payment processing partners that it should place its confidence in age rating systems like PEGI, rather than ask for the all-out removal of adult and mature content. </p>



<p>"<em>The UK games industry champions creative freedom while taking its responsibilities to players seriously. Clear and consistent age ratings are crucial part of helping people make informed choices about the content they engage with. That's why UKIE strongly supports the use of robust classification systems like PEGI across all platforms, including those hosting adult or experimental content. This ensures that content is labelled appropriately, that younger audiences are protected, and that creators can publish with transparency. We believe payment providers and platforms alike should have confidence in trusted age rating systems and the enforcement mechanisms behind them</em>."</p>



<p>If you don't have your Steam settings tuned to not show you adult content, then you're aware of how much space they take up in the store and in its list of trending games. It's unclear how far the pressure from payment processors will go, and if we'll see all adult content entirely removed from Steam and Itch.io in the coming months. </p>



<p>One thing the internet is not lacking in, however, is adult content. Players looking for those kinds of games will undoubtedly find them elsewhere if Steam and Itch.io stop becoming options for them. The people who will be impacted the most by this are the people creating these games, who already found audiences on Steam and Itch.io, and who will have to start from scratch in one form or another to build those audiences elsewhere.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Are These Horrible Mental Health App Ads]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/liven-app-youtube-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-are-these-horrible-mental-health-app-ads.1255095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all know endlessly scrolling is bad, and the way mental health can get talked about on these endless scroll platforms is bad, and also AI slop is bad. But what if you combined all of them? You’d get these ads for an app called Liven that will not leave me alone recently, until I finally decided to face them head-on and enter a very special circle of Hell.</p><p>I have to start with a confession here: I have been seeing these ads because I have fallen back into my habit of <a href="https://aftermath.site/reels-shorts-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compulsively scrolling YouTube shorts</a>. This is a bad use of my time and makes my brain feel like a hotel lobby carpet, and I hate that I’m doing it. Anyway, increasingly often when I’m scrolling that endless feed, an ad for Liven will pop up. Some deeply specific self-help phrase will play over a beat, like “this is how procrastination manifests in high-performing men” or “day in the life of a dopamine-addicted man.” These sound like pop mental health garbage, so I usually quickly scroll away.</p><p>Last night I finally decided to let one of the full ads play through, and they’re <em>fascinating</em>. They’re set to dance or club beats, but instead of being advertising jingles in the traditional sense, they’re just <em>text</em>, an entire series of sentences like you’d see in ad copy. They don’t rhyme, and the flow of words doesn’t follow the music in a way that works together with it. They mention the Liven app, but not in a chorus or musically memorable moment in the song. Here’s an example:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Procrastination, Liven commercial song." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeErTZKV5GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here’s another:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven &quot;How Procrastination Manifests In High-Performing Man&quot; Ad" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBVnqepcZjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One more, if I have to suffer you have to suffer:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven's latest procrastination song is even better than the original!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Td0LEO-TE4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some are specifically geared toward women (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVnqepcZjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is how dopamine obsession looks in women</a>”) while others are geared toward men (“<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@peachymoon___/video/7525238149673536786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men with ADHD often become insecure ‘nice guys</a>’”). I’ll hand it to Liven’s ad department for using the language popular (and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/31/more-than-half-of-top-100-mental-health-tiktoks-contain-misinformation-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harmful</a>) on the short-form content channels where the ads play, and for tailoring their message toward how users on those channels might be feeling. Case in point: I feel awful about my use of these platforms, and I often investigate why I engage in this scrolling behavior when it doesn’t make me feel good. I don’t think the ads’ creators thought this deeply or they’d have made better ads, but starting off with “this” can be read as subtly turning the whole thing back on me: seeing the ad <em>is</em> how procrastination is manifesting in my life! Purporting to then have an answer, and even better an answer that lives on an app and thus on the phone where I’m mindlessly scrolling, is a real example of meeting potential customers where they are. Congrats to Liven, really.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven &quot;How Procrastination Turned Me Into A Tired Man&quot; Ad" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZuKnHwXat8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’m not alone in seeing these ads an unusual amount. I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/comments/1ks1dtj/is_anyone_else_sick_of_or_even_seeing_this_liven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jhbatb/has_anyone_tried_liven_app_i_hear_its_a_scam_but/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">folks</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/comments/1kjmsge/ai_generated_adhd_ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymobilegameads/comments/1kvw442/new_ai_slop_liven_ad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> also complaining about their frequency and how much they stink of self-help bullshit. Many folks speculate they’re made by AI; beyond the sounds-like-<a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a>-but-isn’t of the songs, the videos that accompany the ads feature some of the hallmarks of AI animation: characters <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymobilegameads/comments/1kvw442/new_ai_slop_liven_ad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change</a> throughout the videos, and the animations feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c5aLhxyljYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space-fillers</a> rather than going along with the song, and they don’t seem to line up with the topic being sung about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theliven.livenhabits&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liven-discover-yourself/id6450840109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pages</a>, Liven calls itself “your self-discovery companion, a system of tools designed to help you better understand and transform yourself.” It seems to include mood and task trackers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLuNh-XtuGs/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logs</a>, short education sections, quizzes, and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMOFOF9uS9O/?hl=en&amp;img_index=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI chat bot</a> that Liven writes will “help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try.” It seems like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjIul5BE25Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basic</a> stuff, though some user <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liven-discover-yourself/id6450840109?see-all=reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a> complain of upsells, trouble cancelling their subscriptions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/191th5x/have_you_tried_liven_how_does_it_work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unauthorized charges</a>, or just a lack of personalization. I can’t tell if it’s a “scam,” as some users call it, or just a faddy cash grab in the style of so much self-help-meets-technology offerings out there, though I certainly would not give it my money. As a common refrain in many of the ads goes, “A friend [or in my case, a mind-numbing social media algorithm] told me about the Liven app, I was skeptical at first.”&nbsp;</p><p>That “I was skeptical” is the line I can call up from memory feels like a real flaw in these ads as ads. Because the songs are so unstructured, they don’t have choruses or hooks like a traditional ad. After falling down the hole of them last night, I was brushing my teeth and realized I had one of them in my head. But because they’re just a series of words instead of <em>songs</em>, I wasn’t humming a call to action like getting the app, but instead random words like “dopamine” and “procrastination.” Is it an ad for procrastination? Is it an ad for being skeptical of the app? I am more aware of the app and what it does than I was before, a basic function of ads, and I am far more familiar with the company’s advertising now than any human should be, but the ad hasn’t even managed to groove “buy this product” into my brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I started my dive into these ads laughing at their absurdity, but by the end of it I had stayed up way too late and felt gross both about the internet and myself. That’s the exact kind of feeling the app seems to want to solve, so that’s either killer marketing that drives home how much I need the app, or a signal that this app is just another piece of the system it says it wants to help users break free of. I will end this blog before I overthink my way into believing the Liven people are actually marketing geniuses, but if you hadn’t seen these yet, I’m sorry for putting them in your head too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/spice-girls-anime-production-ig"><h3>I’m Mad We Didn’t Get A Spice Girls Anime</h3></a><p>Look I'm not saying it would have been good, but just look at how cool it looks!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft"><h3>Ozzy Osbourne Played A Video Game Convention In 2009, And It Ruled</h3></a><p>"The kids had a great time.

            <p>A demo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be playable at this year's Gamescom, with Microsoft set to show it off in tandem with the first public exhibition of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">ROG Xbox Ally</a> handheld. </p>
<p>Yep, the fates of this long-awaited Metroidvania sequel and Asus' Xbox-branded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">portable PC</a> continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld">intertwine</a>, like star-crossed lovers.

<p>Right, before you ask, there's still no full release date for Silksong as I write this. It's still just coming at some point in what remains of 2025. Got it? Ok, on we go. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_7.28.1">Xbox have announced</a> it'll be one of the games coming "this Holiday and beyond" with a playable demo at the console makers' booth in Cologne.</p>
<p>They didn't offer much more info as to what you can expect from the Silksong demo, which comes just a little bit prior to the game's much-discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">Australian museum cameo</a> in September. Well, aside from the fact it's one of the games you'll be able to give a go on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are also set to come out later this year (it'll be playable on conventional PCs as well).</p>

<p>I'd say why not bake a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">big Silksong-themed cake</a> to take with you if you're going to the German leg of the summergamesthings, but given the company running its booth recently executed some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">horrible mass layoffs</a>, maybe not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-as-xbox-offer-first-chances-to-fiddle-with-the-rog-xbox-ally]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV series showrunner Ronald D. Moore has revealed some more info about what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, but it's probably going to be a while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Moore confirmed that the show will adapt the Norse stories featured in 2018's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Ragnarok</em>, since Kratos and his son Atreus will form the core duo at the heart of the show.</p>

<p>Moore says the tone of the show will "emulate the tone of the game", depicting an "epic journey" that's also a "heartfelt story of...two men" setting out to "honor the memory of [Kratos'] wife, Atreus' mother". It sounds, then, like the first season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">the 2018 title</a>.</p>

Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show sounds like it'll be a pretty direct adaptation of the 2018 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collider</a> a few days ago, Moore said that his show will be an "adaptation-slsh-interpretation" of the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>universe, and that while the showrunners want to keep the story and characters, there's "a lot here [they] can play with".</p>

<p>Moore refused to be drawn on how many seasons the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV show would span, however. He says he's focusing on the task at hand rather than looking too far into the future, so we don't know how long the show will run.</p>

<p>He does, however, confirm that filming hasn't yet started on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and that the process is unlikely to begin until next year at the very earliest. Sounds like it's going to be quite a while before&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>comes to Prime Video, then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-tv-series-ronald-d.-moore-ragnarok.jpg?itok=jiyiMDoa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-tv-series-ronald-d.-moore-ragnarok.jpg?itok=hBBCJpDc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will each new&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game get one season, two, or more? It's hard to say right now.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks as though this&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series will be all you're getting in terms of&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>for the foreseeable future, at any rate. No third game in the Norse series has been confirmed, and it was reported back in January that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">had canceled</a> an in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>Ronald D. Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show is set to debut on Prime Video at some point in the future. Here's hoping Kratos' companions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">are a little more muted</a> than they are in 2021's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>.</p>

The company is hiring for a senior director of multiplatform and account management, which is a fancy way of saying someone who will help Sony profit from bringing its games to more storefronts. This person will be in charge of “global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.”</p><p>Fans are already treating this as a window into Sony’s thinking moving forward, including the possibility of it bringing more of its own first-party exclusives to other platforms, something that seemed unthinkable even just a few months ago. The job listing for the multiplatform leadership role goes on to say, “Oversee the out-of-year (mid-range) commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios titles across all non-PlayStation platforms, driving long-term revenue growth and audience reach.” It also lists direct reports that include people overseeing sales on both Xbox &amp; PC.</p><p>Sony’s multiplatform approach began small with bringing big single-player exclusives like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and<em> Days Gone </em>to PC years after they were out on console. <em>MLB: The Show</em> is also on Xbox Series X/S and Switch, though it’s published by MLB on those platforms. Upcoming Bungie shooter<em> Marathon</em> is also multiplatform. Then last fall, Sony announced the <em>Horizon </em>Lego spin-off, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, for both PS5 and Switch. And just this month, Sony revealed it will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">publish <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox Series X/S</a></span>. The new job listing, however, suggests things won’t stop there, and that this may be a reaction to more than just Microsoft bailing on the hardware race. </p><p>The tech giant has been on an accelerated course due to the struggling sales of Xbox this generation.

A year later, <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>has made the jump, and <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will bring the Locust-chain-sawing  shooter franchise to Sony’s platform almost 20 years after it became synonymous with Xbox. What’s more, monthly sales charts show these ported exclusives, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, are selling great on its long-time rival’s platform. </p><p>One way to view rumblings that Sony will look to bring more of its games to other platforms is as a direct reaction to Microsoft essentially throwing in the towel on exclusivity. But ballooning blockbuster development budgets and stagnating console sales—PS5 isn’t surging past PS4, thanks to lost ground by Xbox—suggests Sony is looking for more ways to profit off its games regardless of what competitors do. <em>Helldivers 2</em> makes it easy to draw the current line at just multiplayer live service games, but if Sony really does see Xbox as becoming indistinguishable from a gaming PC in the future (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">complete with access to Steam</a></span>), it’s not hard to see it replicating its single-player blockbuster strategy on Xbox as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-recommend-id="image://8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helldivers fight below Xbox logos.

But another might simply be that people don’t buy consoles that way anymore. “People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list,” Circna gaming research director Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Game Business</em></a></span> last week. “You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point.”</p><p>It was a version of what Phil Spencer admitted in 2023 at what now appears to have been an important inflection point for Xbox. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he told<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446"> the<em> Kinda Funny </em>podcast</a></span> at the time. “That’s not going to happen.” He went on to say that many players are locked into wherever their digital libraries are now, calling the Xbox One/PS4 battle the “worst generation” to lose from the perspective of fighting over market share. </p><p>I’ve been skeptical of this view and think it undercounts Microsoft’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">persistent struggle to consistently ship high-quality exclusive games</a></span> that everyone wants to play. But it also seems undeniable that players, especially younger ones, are less attached to where they play games than ever as long as they can play what they want. Does this mean we’ll see <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> on Xbox Series X/S next year? Almost certainly not. But exclusivity increasingly feels less like a promise binding all Sony first-party games, and more like a ticking clock competing platforms bake into their long-tail sales strategy. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122]]></content:encoded>

Every Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase, rumors start to swirl that this time—<em>this time</em>—the game is going to appear, and we’ll see it moving, and there will be a release date. And none of that ever happens. One of my favorite ever headlines on <em>Kotaku</em> was this one from Willa  after it didn’t show in April 2024's Direct: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028"><em>Silksong</em> Fans Won’t Survive Another Round of Disappointment.</a></span></p><p>Then today, looking through the impossible avalanche of industry emails that pour in, I noticed Microsoft had sent over its itinerary for this year’s Gamescom. Germany’s Gamescom is the biggest gaming show in the world, and every August features its own Geoff Keighley-hosted night of trailers during which <em>Silksong</em> also doesn’t appear. But what’s this? Hidden in the list of games Microsoft will have playable in its booths at this year’s event, tucked between <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and <em>Borderlands 4...</em>it’s <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>In fact, the email even specifies, “This includes the first ever public opportunity to go hands on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, including a new playable demo for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em>”</p><p>Rumors spread earlier this year that there might be some sort of strange deal between the ROG Xbox Ally and <em>Silksong</em>, after the logo for the game appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">in the launch trailer for the handheld console</a></span>.</p><p>However, Team Cherry’s Matthew “Leth” Griffin then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped on the game’s Discord</a></span> to confirm a previous vague suggestion the game would come out before Christmas 2025, and to add “we are not tied to a console release.”</p><p>Still, this Gamescom tie-in suggests there’s <em>something</em> going on there. Could it turn out to be pre-loaded on the ROG Xbox Ally, as well as being sold separately elsewhere? It’d sure be a cool incentive.</p><p>But more importantly, it seems <em>Silksong</em> actually exists so much that there’s at the very least a playable demo of the game. You just need to head to Germany next month to see it to believe it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121]]></content:encoded>

From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15–20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That’s what I do. That’s what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it’s a long ways away." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield says he's "back to [his] art," but admits he misses AAA development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans.

Celebrating the full Unova roster, these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> sets stand out not just for gameplay but also for their pure focus on the beloved Gen V. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every card in the expansion has an Illustration Rare or better, a few have emerged as both highly collectable and competitively viable. As a result, some cards have been selling out more over at dedicated card marketplace <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/sv-black-bolt?productLineName=pokemon&amp;setName=sv-black-bolt&amp;productTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;view=grid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a> than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dive into the standout cards and the artwork that have collectors scrambling for singles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – The 10 Most Popular Cards From Black Bolt</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Bolt’s top sellers blend power, nostalgia, and jaw-dropping art, also sharing some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards in White Flare and Black Bolt</a> too. N’s Plan leads the Trainer hype with a serene illustration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Zekrom ex shows up three times, with the coveted Black White Rare version being the most in-demand — and expensive — of them all. Air Balloon’s reprint is a clean, functional favourite, and Genesect ex is a collector and/or competitive player’s dream with three sleek variations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seismitoad’s psychedelic Round set-up adds both charm and synergy. And then, further down, Victini’s bold Black White Rare print rounds out the list as a fiery sleeper hit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">N’s Plan – 170/086</h2><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225973"><div id="225973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Plan - 170/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Illustrated with a striking close-up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJP31?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Plan</a> is a simple but impactful Supporter card that lets you move up to two Energy from your Benched Pokémon to your Active. It’s already seeing experimental play for energy manipulation combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real reason collectors are eyeing it, however, is the artwork. Featuring N against a glowing night fairground, this is one of the most beautiful Trainer cards in the set. It captures a rare moment of peace and nostalgia for its deeply tied scene in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokémon Black</a><em> &amp; </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version/walkthroughs">White</a> games — set on that same ferris wheel in the background, with N revealing that he is actually the king of Team Plasma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">N’s plan is also available as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWXy?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Uncommon and Secret Rare</u></a>, but this is the version everyone wants in their collections.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 034/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225972"><div id="225972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 034/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three varities of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgXAM?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> on this list, this one might be the most aggressive-looking of the bunch. It shares the same stats and moveset but showcases Zekrom mid-roar, bolts of lightning wrapping around its frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a card that goes all-in on intensity — the pose, the expression, the thunder. It’s easy to see why it’s become a standout for players who want their decks to look as powerful as they play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Air Balloon – 079/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225971"><div id="225971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Air Balloon - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reprint of a beloved Tool card, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgPjw?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air Balloon</a> reduces a Pokémon’s retreat cost by two Energy. It sees regular play in many decks thanks to its versatility, but this version’s value is bumped by its clean and nostalgic look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration is simple but effective, with a bright red balloon floating in an airy green background. It evokes early Pokémon art styles with its softness and clarity, and longtime fans are snapping it up fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 169/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225970"><div id="225970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 169/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive take on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJPRY?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> in the set, this Special Illustration Rare version leans darker with a more industrial setting. Framed by black and crimson tones, the artwork gives the impression of a covert mission or even a monster movie scenario. It still offers Metallic Signal and Protect Charge, but the mood here is more intense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the most atmospheric of the Genesect trio. It’s one of those cards that gives hints of a chilling story, as well their being a stylish addition to their decks. On the other hand, with there being cheaper options, it’s good to keep this pricey card at least in a top loader if you want to retain its value. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 161/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225969"><div id="225969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 161/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWpK?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> appears again as a radiant, glossy Secret Rare. All the same play value from its ability and attack, but now clad in reflective armour with dynamic camera angles — looking like a pure weapon ready to fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this one desirable is its futuristic sheen. It’s mechanical but elegant, and some collectors seem to prefer the balance between high-tech precision, bold colour use, and being slightly more budget-friendly than the Special Illustration Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 166/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225968"><div id="225968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 166/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03ZGE?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> shares the same devastating Voltage Burst attack and utility-focused Slash of the earlier Double Rare, but is elevated by its the thunderstorm backdrop. Lightning crackles around Zekrom in a dynamic battle pose that sells its raw, storm-born power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the below Black White version, this one is all about motion and energy. It’s a favourite among players who want a flashy yet functional attacker, and it stands as a reminder that good art can enhance competitive cards without compromising on impact. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although its current $200+ market price may make you want to get this one PSA-graded instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 067/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225967"><div id="225967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 067/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47dOd?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> is function-first, but its standard foil still makes it pop. What makes this card playable is the featured Metallic Signal Ability, searching for two Evolution Metal Pokémon every turn — and Protect Charge, which hits for 150 and reduces incoming damage by 30 next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s not the flashiest version of Genesect, the vibrant swirls of metallic pink and white light that frame the Pokémon give this card a sense of speed and energy. Most importantly, it’s the most affordable for those who want to slot this into a deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seismitoad – 105/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225966"><div id="225966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seismitoad - 105/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare of <a href="https://seismitoad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seismitoad</a> is not only one of the most psychedelic prints in White Flare, but it also has real deck-building potential. Its Round attack does 70 damage for each Pokémon you control with the same attack, meaning it scales dangerously with board set-up. Add in Hyper Voice at 160 damage and you’ve got a hefty Stage 2 option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the artwork certainly has a wow factor too. With swirling, trippy patterns and an oddly serene expression, Seismitoad looks like it wandered into a Beatles album cover. It’s colourful, weird, and unforgettable. With it being #3 among Black Bolt’s best sellers on TCG Player, that aesthetic flair has pushed this card into top-tier collector territory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Victini – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225965"><div id="225965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Victini - 171/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Victini’s White Flare Black White Rare edition has become a surprise high roller. At first glance, it’s easy to underestimate. After all, 80 HP on a Basic doesn’t scream value. But a real kicker is its attack, V-Force, which hits for 120 damage with just two Fire Energy; if you have five or more Benched Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Fire swarm decks, that’s not hard to hit, making this a shockingly good closer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAk6b?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Victini’s</a> is cemented most of all by its unique presentation. This Black White Rare treatment uses deep reds and a minimalist embossed foil that makes Victini feel like a mythic figure, despite its size. It radiates heat, charm, and just enough menace to make you look twice. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225964"><div id="225964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 172/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The top seller among TCG Player Pokémon cards in Black Bolt, this Black White Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GD22?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> combines raw power with prestige. Like the others Zekroms in this list, Voltage Burst attack starts at 130 damage and gains +50 for each Prize card your opponent has taken, creating late-game knockout potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 30 recoil damage is offset by Zekrom’s chunky 230 HP and synergy with Lightning acceleration like Miraidon or Flaaffy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monochrome foil art makes it one of the most imposing cards in the set, alongside the above Victini. Rendered in elegant grayscale on an imposing pure-black background, Zekrom’s jagged lines and fierce pose turn it into a poster-worthy collectable. It’s a card that hits hard in play and even harder in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

                <p>The Friday the 13th films have been dead in the water for more than a decade due to an issue involving the rights to the series, also leading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-350279">Friday the 13th: The Game's</a> servers to shut down last year, leaving the game completely unplayable. Last year, though, after the rights issue had finally been resolved, the <a href="https://jasonuniverse.com/" rel="nofollow ">Jason Universe</a> was announced as a multimedia effort supposedly including films, games, and more. Now, as announced at a panel held at San Diego Comic-Con over the weekend, it's been revealed that a new game is in the works.</p><p dir="ltr">This comes from Horror Inc. VP Robbie Barsamian (thanks, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3890048/new-friday-the-13th-film-and-video-game-in-early-development/" rel="nofollow ">Bloody Disgusting</a>), who said during the panel "I can tell you that a new sequel movie and new sequel game are at the top of our list. It’s where most of our energy’s going right now. And I can tell you finally we’re in a position to deliver on that." He went on to explain, "While we’re not officially announcing with our partners today, both are coming. They’re both in the works and they’re both coming."</p>
