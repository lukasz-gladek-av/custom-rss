<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 yesterday and it's resolved some compatibility issues.</p>
<p>There's been an issue with the 2021 releases <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a></strong>, with both Switch titles reportedly crashing from time to time on the new hybrid system. Fortunately, Nintendo appears to have finally resolved these problems after the rollout of the 21.2.0 system firmware.</p>
<p>This is now officially reflected on Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">software compatibility search page</a>:</p><div><figure data-videoid="UhXw8bSC6A0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytUhXw8bSC6A0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhXw8bSC6A0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38ea9bvoxkmh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 01/13/2026</strong> - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One other game fixed is the "RTS, tower defense, and match-3" title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cats_on_duty">Cats on Duty</a> (<em>yes, you read that correctly</em>), which is <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/01006b401d426000">now fully supported</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe</a> on the Switch 2 tied to audio issues in certain areas of the game, so we'll hopefully see a fix for this soon. Once again, you can find out more about the compatibility of Switch titles on the Switch 2 via Nintendo's software compatibility search page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a banner launch day for Hytale, the new sandbox game from the creators of popular Minecraft server Hypixel. In addition to a surge of players and a lot of positive buzz, it's shot up to become, briefly, the most popular game on Twitch, with over 420k viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">observed first by PC Gamer</a>, who earlier today clocked that it was the most-watched game on Twitch and the second-most-watched category, only behind Just Chatting by about 43k views. At the time this piece was written, Hytale had dropped down to around 260k viewers, but is still the most-watched video game and the third-most-watched category. It's now behind both Just Chatting and football (soccer, for the Americans) league Kings League. And it seems possible that it will surge further in the coming days.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a heck of a comeback story for a game that, half a year ago, was thought to be canceled entirely. Hytale, made by the developers of wildly popular Minecraft server Hypixel, was first announced in 2018 with an incredibly popular trailer, and garnered plenty of buzz at the time. Riot Games took notice, invested, and in 2020 acquired it entirely. However, Hytale was delayed several times as its scope grew, and just this past year was canceled entirely by Riot. Then, in November, co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he had acquired the IP rights back from Riot, and in an incredibly fast turnaround, he and the team got the game ready for an early access release today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to its popularity on Twitch, Hytale has already made enough money to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">cover two more years of development</a>, and its <a href="https://hytale.curseforge.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modding scene is already bustling day one</a>.

Though we're still waiting for confirmation from Hypixel as to how many players are checking it out today, Collins-Laflamme made a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-dev-expects-over-1-million-players-to-turn-up-for-early-access-release-date-asks-fans-to-download-the-launcher-now">bold prediction of one million players on day one</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>While absolutely another instance of gruesome bloodletting for the video game industry, 2025 at least <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u>had fewer layoffs than the prior year</u></a>. 2026, on the other hand, is off to a terrible start.</p><p>Today three major companies announced layoffs in some capacity, beginning with Meta, which shut down Sanzaru, Armature, and Twisted Pixel – all VR studios. The first worked on <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em>, an award-winning game, while the latter is fresh off releasing <em>Deadpool VR</em> in November. The studios are victims of Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3m775t5ndvc2r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>predictably disastrous overinvestment</u></a> in VR and the metaverse, with roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees also set to be laid off, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to The New York Times</u></a>.</p><p>“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”</p><p>Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/its-january-13-and-ubisoft-just-announced-its-second-round-of-layoffs-for-2026-at-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced more layoffs</u></a> today – its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>second round</u></a> in as many weeks, a time period that constitutes the entire year. Following a “voluntary transition program” at <em>Division</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and <em>Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</em> studio Massive Entertainment, the company decided to finish the job with an old-fashioned slash-and-burn treatment, eliminating approximately 55 roles at the Malmö, Sweden-based Massive, as well as Ubisoft Stockholm.&nbsp;</p><p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” a company rep <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told IGN</u></a>, noting that <em>The Division</em> will be the studios’ primary focus going forward. “These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams.”</p><p>Lastly, former Xbox hype man Larry “Major Nelson” Hyrb, an industry veteran, announced that he’s been laid off from Unity after joining the <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cut-happy</u></a> <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails?ref=aftermath.site"><u>company</u></a> in 2024.</p><p>"Like many in the gaming space recently, I've been laid off from Unity," he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:c4hu4bppjn6wilmucfikwite/post/3mccuyabbv22d?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said on Bluesky</u></a>. "I am proud of the goals my team and I accomplished in just 18 months, and I am grateful for the creators and teams I had the chance to support. Now, I am excited to explore the next chapter."</p><p>It is unclear if Hyrb's dismissal is part of a larger wave of layoffs at Unity.</p><p>This marks a rough beginning to the year for game workers, especially following yesterday’s news that Rockstar workers who alleged they were fired unjustly amid a unionization push <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>won’t have their pay restored</u></a> during mandatory legal proceedings. However, small silver lining: IWGB, the union representing the workers in the upcoming tribunal, still believes that it will win out in the end.</p><p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we've come out of last week's hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gameworkers.co.uk/post/3mccnz6vhuk2b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement published today</u></a>. “Over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures. … This hearing could have alleviated the hardships faced by those in financial precarity or forced to leave the country as a result of Rockstar's actions but we remain undeterred in our efforts to hold them to account.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/"><div><p>Trying To Get A Job In Video Games Right Now Is Like Crawling Through Hell - Aftermath</p><p>The application process has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

                <p>Meta has shut down three of Oculus Studios' internal developers, new reporting has revealed. Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studio have all been impacted.</p><p>Outlets suchs as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html?ref=uploadvr.com" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> indicated that cuts were coming to Meta's Reality Labs business, which encompasses first-party VR game development. On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. </p><p><a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a> confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/meta-layoffs-vr-game-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. </p><p>It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.</p><p>Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Marvel's Deadpool VR</a> in November 2025.</p><p>Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.</p><p>Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-vr-review-a-selection-of-good-things-stranger/1900-6417767/" data-ref-id="1900-6417767">Resident Evil 4</a> in 2021.</p><p>As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/</link>
            <guid>1405285</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees who lost their jobs last week when Ubisoft Halifax was shut down, have officially filed a legal complaint.</p>



<p>The complaint accuses Ubisoft of “shutting down its Halifax studio to keep out the union”.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s against the law to stop workers from joining a union in Canada, but the slap on the wrist employers often get is not enough to stop this,” </strong>CWA Canada President Carmel Smyth said in a release. <strong>“The penalty should reflect the reality of intentional corporate bullying.”</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft has denied that the closure was related to its employees joining the Union. They <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim that the closure</a> had been in the plans <strong>“well before”</strong> the staff unionized. The France-based company said that the decision came as part of the company’s 24-month process to <strong>“streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-cwa-is-looking-for-from-the-board">What The CWA Is Looking For From The Board</h2>



<p>The CWA says that after the layoffs were announced, the union’s lawyers contacted Ubisoft to demand records and information related to the claim that the decision was done entirely out of <strong>“financial necessity”</strong>.</p>







<p>The union is requesting that the labor law be updated to give labor boards, like the Nova Scotia Labor Board, the ability to force employers to reopen for a year. They also request that employers either help find other work for impacted staff or pay laid-off workers three years’ salary. </p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology.”</strong></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s New England wasteland</a> is full of all manner of abominations. You can now add a mutant snail masquerading as a cardboard cutout of Todd Howard to that list. Twitch streamer Blurbs modded it into the game for his latest playthrough. The scariest part? Let Howard catch you and you automatically die. “It just works.”</p> <p>That’s a famous line the veteran Bethesda designer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OleheKCR_cA">uttered on stage at E3 2015</a> when describing crafting in<em> Fallout 4</em>. It is not a good way to describe <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">Blurbs’ latest mod</a>, which includes other wasteland hijinks like NPCs randomly exploding and dogs raining from the sky. A video uploaded to YouTube shows all of it in action:</p>

  <p>Blurbs took a snail mod for <em>Fallout 4</em> and swapped the model with a picture of Howard, with the condition that the player dies if the two ever collide. Easy to avoid because it moves so slowly, unless you aren’t paying attention and the <em>Starfield</em> director quietly ambushes you from behind.</p>

 <p>My favorite part is the low-budget cardboard cutout slowly following Blurbs around the map, even when he’s in the middle of a conversation with an NPC. In fact, seeing the 2D developer poking out of the far side of the frame is the most terrifying part of the whole thing. Let’s see how many other games killer Todd can be modded into <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-todd-howard-has-talked-about-fallout-5-2000655749">before<em> Fallout 5</em> launches</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-2-gen-ai-shift-up-sequel-2000659439</link>
            <guid>1405219</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will gen AI be part of <em>Stellar Blade 2</em>‘s development? It doesn’t sound entirely outside the realm of possibility after recent comments from developer Shift Up’s CEO. The South Korean game studio is currently working on a sequel to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-game-review-ps5-bayonetta-nier-dmc-sekiro-1851432247">2024 sci-fi action game</a> and its boss thinks AI is the only way to compete with the massive development teams coming out of China.</p> <p>“We devote around 150 people to a single game, but China puts in between 1,000 to 2,000,” Hyung-tae Kim, who also served as director on&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, said during a recent conference briefing according <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">to<em> GameMeca</em></a> (translated <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">v</a><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">ia <em>Automaton</em></a>). “We lack the capacity to compete, both in terms of quality and volume of content.”</p>

 <p>The remarks were part of the Shift Up CEO’s address during the “2026 Economic Growth Strategy” conference held on January 9. South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, was in attendance. Kim went on to suggest that generative AI and LLM tools will be important for evening out the playing field.</p>

 <p>He argued that with AI, “one person can perform the work of 100 people.” Will this lead to mass layoffs? Not according to the Shift Up CEO. That’s because global competition will require countries to still utilize every possible worker. Sounds fun!</p>

 <p>Was Kim actually worried about rising competition from China, or was he just flexing his geopolitical muscle as <em>Stellar Blade</em>‘s popularity catapults Shift Up into the big time? After all, that game sold millions of copies across <a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-pc-steam-release-date-soulslike-scifi-ps5-1851696612">console and PC</a> without the help of AI, even as Tencent, Net Ease, and other major Chinese publishers flood the market with AAA free-to-play games.</p>

 <p>For now at least, Shift Up employees are being well taken care of. <em>Seoul Economic Daily</em> <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2K773GI6BZ">recently reported</a> that all 300 employees at the studio were given AirPods Max, Apple Watches, and a bonus $3,400 to celebrate the company’s profitable 2025. Why no video game consoles? It already gifted PS5 Pros and Switch 2s <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/shift-up-ceo-gifted-all-his-employees-nintendo-switch-2-to-celebrate-stellar-blade-3-millions-sale.1685455/">last year</a>.</p>

 <p>Shift Up is currently aiming to release <em>Stellar Blade 2</em> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/20/stellar-blade-developer-plans-to-release-a-sequel-before-2027">before the end of 2027</a>. Hopefully it’s not relying on gen AI to do it.</p>

<p>The first handful of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in January 2026 have been leaked ahead of the official reveal.</p>



<p>Known leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a> has revealed the first six games that will be announced. </p>







<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, five of the games being added this month are Resident Evil Village (PS5 | PS4), Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5 | PS4), Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5 | PS4), A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5 | PS4), and art of rally (PS5 | PS4). </p>

<p>All of the games, per the report, will be available starting January 20. </p>







<p>While those six games are likely based on Billbil-kun’s track record, it should be taken with a grain of salt until the official announcement.

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals – Everything We Know About NetEase’s Super Hero-Charged Shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/marvel-rivals-everything-we-know-about-neteases-super-hero-charged-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1405186</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> arrived on the shooter scene right at the end of 2024, and it arrived with such a bang, it made it seem like all Blizzard actually needed to do with Overwatch was make all the characters Marvel heroes. The third-person shooter expanded on the momentum built by its massive launch and has definitively wedged itself into the shooter genre and earned a spot among the other live-service free-to-play shooters.</p>



<p>As NetEase is charging up to make Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">"<em>the biggest game possible</em>,"</a> here's everything we know about the MOBA shooter stuffed with Marvel characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals initially arrived on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on December 6, 2024. On September 12, 2025, a version of the game was released for PlayStation 4. It has always been a free-to-play title with in-game microtransactions for cosmetic items and battle passes.</p>



<p>Premium transactions in Marvel Rivals are made with Lattice, which is one of several in-game currencies players can collect in the game, and the only one that can be purchased with real-world money. Untis, Chrono Tokens, Costume Coins, Unstable Molecules, and limited-time event-based currencies make up the rest of the in-game currencies you can collect.</p>



<p>Lattice, however, is the currency that you need to concern yourself with since it is the one used to buy battle passes and the only one you can buy with real-world money.</p>



<p>The price of Lattice, like other premium currencies in free-to-play games, can fluctuate with sales and sometimes price increases, but the current cost for the different amounts you can purchase is:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 Lattice = $0.99 USD</li>



<li>500 Lattice = $4.99 USD</li>



<li>1000 Lattice = $9.99 USD</li>



<li>2180 Lattice = $19.99 USD</li>



<li>5680 Lattice = $49.99 USD</li>



<li>11,680 Lattice = $99.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the battle pass is 990 Lattice, making the battle pass just under $10 USD and leaving you with only 10 Lattice if you purchase the 1000 Lattice option. Just enough to get the battle pass, but nowhere near what you'd need to get something else. </p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a third-person, free-to-play hero-shooter set within the Marvel universe, featuring Marvel characters from every corner of the comic books, though unsurprisingly leading with some of the most popular ones in today's age due to the popularity of the numerous Marvel movies that have been made in the past two decades.</p>



<p>The story, as you might have been able to guess considering the game includes Marvel characters from across space and time, is a <strong>multiverse-based</strong> story, which begins with two versions of <strong>Doctor Doom</strong>, one from the future and one from the present. Both Doom's separately worked on combining magic and science in order to gain control of the multiverse, and when the present-day Doom tries to execute his work, he ends up running into future Doctor Doom from 2099.</p>



<p>The fight that ensues between them causes chaos and leaves the multiverse in a fragile state, threatening to destroy everything until <strong>Galacta</strong>, the daughter of Galactus, contains the problem within a few mixed-up and muddied timelines. With several Marvel heroes and villains now seemingly stuck in the middle of both Doom's fighting, they all take sides as they agree or disagree on how to move forward. Meanwhile, Galacta keeps the whole thing contained as she gets a steady diet of <strong>Chronovium</strong>, her food of choice, rather than trying to eat planets like her father.</p>



<p>That is essentially the setup for why these characters, whether allies in the comics or not, are all fighting together in this seemingly never-ending bout. Each season adds new elements to the story with new playable characters introduced, and while it feels like a premise that is stretched thin to make the gameplay work, it's realistically not the craziest foundation for a story in Marvel history.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-season-of-marvel-rivals-so-far">Every Season of Marvel Rivals so far</h2>



<p>This section will be continuously updated with the release of new seasons in Marvel Rivals, so the following list is only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season 0: Dooms' Rise</strong> - December 6, 2024-January 10, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 1: Eternal Night Falls</strong> - January 10, 2025-April 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 2: Hellfire Gala - </strong>April 11, 2025-July 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 3: The Abyss Awakens</strong> - July 11, 2025-September 12, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 4: Heart of the Dragon </strong>- September 12, 2025-November 13, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 5: Love is a Battlefield </strong>- November 13, 2025-January 16, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Season 6: Night at the Museum</strong> - January 16, 2026-March 20, 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>When Marvel Rivals first launched, its Season 0 lasted five weeks, with Seasons 1 and 2 then lasting three months. After those initial three seasons, NetEase Games established a new seasonal structure, with every season lasting two months, with a major update in the middle of each, dividing seasons into halves. Each half of a season adds a new character and a map to the roster, while the battle pass for each season runs for the entire two months.</p>



<p>New cosmetics, game modes, limited-time modes, and balance changes vary from season to season with how they are introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is, at its core, a third-person shooter. Players are divided into two teams, with six players on each side. You can choose between a Quick Match or a Competitive Match to begin, with Quick Match including four game modes and Competitive featuring three.</p>



<p>Quick Match includes Domination, Convoy, Convergence, and Resource Rumble, while Competitive features Domination, Convoy, and Convergence. There's also Arcade Modes, which include Conquest, Doom Match, Conquest (Annihilation), Free Fight, Clone Rumble, and Giant-Size Brain Blast. There's also a Practice mode where you can practice against computer-controlled enemies. </p>



<p>Beyond the various game modes, which change up the rules of engagement, the other layers of gameplay come from the heroes you can choose to play as. Heroes are categorized as Duelists, Vanguards, and Strategists. Vanguards are the frontline heroes that you want charging into the fight, while Duelists are your more specialized characters that can take down enemies quickly and deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<p>Strategists are your support heroes, who help round out the full team to ensure you're approaching each game mode with a winning mixture.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-roster">Hero Roster</h2>



<p>The following list is the current roster of heroes, and with new heroes getting added with each season, this list will only ever be as accurate as possible at the time of publishing. Just like the Seasons list, we'll update this list as new heroes are added.</p>



<ul>
<li>Adam Warlock - Strategist</li>



<li>Angela - Vanguard</li>



<li>Black Panther - Duelist</li>



<li>Black Widow - Duelist</li>



<li>Blade - Duelist</li>



<li>Bruce Banner - Vanguard</li>



<li>Captain America - Vanguard</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger - Strategist</li>



<li>Daredevil - Duelist</li>



<li>Deadpool - Duelist</li>



<li>Doctor Strange - Vanguard</li>



<li>Emma Frost - Vanguard</li>



<li>Gambit - Strategist</li>



<li>Groot - Vanguard</li>



<li>Hawkeye - Duelist</li>



<li>Hela - Duelist</li>



<li>Human Torch - Duelist</li>



<li>Invisible Woman - Strategist</li>

<li>Peni Parker - Vanguard</li>



<li>Phoenix - Duelist</li>



<li>Psylocke - Duelist</li>



<li>Rocket Raccoon - Strategist</li>



<li>Rogue - Vanguard</li>



<li>Scarlet Witch - Duelist</li>



<li>Spider-Man - Duelist</li>



<li>Squirrel Girl - Duelist</li>



<li>Star-Lord - Duelist</li>



<li>Storm - Duelist</li>



<li>The Punisher - Duelist</li>



<li>The Thing - Vanguard</li>



<li>Thor - Vanguard</li>



<li>Ultron - Strategist</li>



<li>Venom - Vanguard</li>



<li>Winter Soldier - Duelist</li>



<li>Wolverine - Duelist</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play shooter with a heavily stylized visual style, Marvel Rivals isn't the kind of game that wants to push your hardware to its limit. It doesn't take too much to run, and if you have the hardware for it, you'll be able to push it as far as possible to maximize your framerate, a key factor for any competitive player.</p>

The tabletop studio known for the iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> has stated that none of its staff are to use AI in either content or design, insisting that senior management aren't excited about the technology.</p><h2>Games Workshop's AI Ban Announcement</h2><p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech" rel="nofollow">IGN report</a>, Wesley Yin-Poole uncovered that the Games Workshop AI ban was announced during a UK financial report. Games Workshop's CEO, Kevin Rountree, stated that GW staff are barred from using generative AI to produce anything.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Rountree qualified this stance by stating that the use of AI is a broad topic on which he is not an expert and that a "few" senior managers are experimenting with the technology.</p><blockquote><p>"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p>“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p></blockquote><p>This stance is in step with Games Workshop's attitude towards generative AI. They updated the rules and guidelines for their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> miniature painting competition to ban any use of AI in submissions. This announcement just extends that ban from fans and enthusiasts in the Warhammer community to the people making the miniatures and writing the rulebooks.</p><p>The Games Workshop statement also stands in stark contrast to other studios in the gaming space. Larian's own Sven Vincke has been raked over the coals for his statements regarding generative AI in the development of the upcoming game, <em>Divinity</em>. Wizards of the Coast's CEO Chris Cocks spoke about the benefits of AI in tabletop development <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">in 2024</a>, which was at odds with the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="nofollow">ban of AI art</a> in <em>D&amp;D</em> books. The list goes on.</p><p>In an environment where generative AI is being forced into every field to justify its existence, it is refreshing to see Games Workshop's stance be so direct.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

                <p>So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-2/" data-ref-id="5000-137">Fallout 2</a> and a writer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>--believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received.</p><p>When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, "They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009456971339149774%7Ctwgr%5E99f1ee048f913fdce98a2199dfe0f1e4cd7a6c94%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fzenimax-bethesda%2Flead-fallout-new-vegas-dev-says-bethesda-strayed-away-from-the-rpgs-origins" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout - and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me.</p>  — Chris Avellone (@ChrisAvellone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Avellone went on to explain that he doesn't hate Bethesda, and he praised the publisher's open-world games before calling out its weaknesses regarding its linear stories and "their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill. But every developer has their pros and cons."</p><p>Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-says-todd-howard/1100-6537213/" data-ref-id="1100-6537213">praised Obsidian Entertainment's work on Fallout: New Vegas</a>, and said that the studio was the only choice to handle the game.

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">described as</a> an "experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." Now, reporter Jez Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2010993531037302935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the game was "only ever a concept" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.</p><p>He added: "It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else."</p><p>In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror." The description continued: "Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible."</p><p>Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as "experimental" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a "showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium."</p><p>As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corden reported</a> that the developer's next title, which he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KPhoHILH4Wo?t=2176s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on the Xbox Two podcast</a> could be Hellblade 3, "will be more combat-involved and interactive" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.</p><p>Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.</a></p><p>2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-6-release-date-deadpool/</link>
            <guid>1405147</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NetEase Games</strong> is getting set to launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-joins-roster-season-6-the-game-awards-2025/">Season 6: Night at the Museum</a></strong> of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/marvel-rivals-everything-we-know-about-neteases-super-hero-charged-shooter/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong> this coming <strong>Friday, January 16, 2026</strong>, which includes the introduction of the game's latest duelist, everyone's favourite merc with a mouth, <strong>Deadpool</strong>.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">Season 5 introduced Rogue and Gambit</a>, Season 6 will start with Deadpool, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow at the halfway point. As NetEase does with every new season, ahead of its launch, the studio has debuted a gameplay trailer showing off the new hero's skills, with today's trailer showcasing Deadpool's lethal arsenal and the various ways in which players can take advantage of his skills.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Deadpool: The Merc with a Mouth | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a Duelist, Deadpool is actually a triple-threat hero. He's a Duelist, a Strategist, and a Vanguard. You can also unlock upgrades for his skills mid-game to make him even more deadly. With all of that built into one character, it's not surprising that in Quick mode games and Competitive mode games, there can only be one Deadpool on either side.</p>



<p>Along with Deadpool entering as the new character for the first half of Season 6, NetEase is introducing a significant update to the Hero Proficiency system. "<em>The cap will be raised for each hero and new rewards added such as Units, Unstable Molecules, Nameplates, Titles, Nameplate Frames, Badges, Dynamic Avatars, and more</em>," writes NetEase in a press release. </p>



<p>Season 6 also introduces a photo mode to Times Square, and Times Square will also be getting a new area called the Clobberin' Club, where you can challenge other players to duels. Then, on January 29, the Museum of Contemplation map will be introduced.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Season 6: Night at the Museum // Dev Vision Vol. 13" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>And as always, there are plenty of bug fixes and balance changes that are coming with the new season, though those will be <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">revealed in the full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>This is the season that is kicking off 2026 for NetEase Games and Marvel Rivals, and if NetEase is to be believed, 2026 will be the year that the studio really shows how much it can grow its third-person hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">after calling 2025 a "<em>warm-up</em>."</a></p>

			<p>More than six years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the release of the first game</a>, <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> returns with <strong>CODE VEIN II</strong>, the sequel to the Soulslike action RPG that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-shipped-over-3-million-copies-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over three million copies</a></strong> across all platforms. While not a smashing success, the game undoubtedly garnered a sizable following. However, the developers are still making changes to several aspects in this new iteration; for instance, it is set in a completely different world with new characters. The first CODE VEIN also allowed co-op multiplayer, whereas this new entry focuses on expanding the Partner System that powers AI companions.</p>



<p>Following a recent press event <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where we went hands-on with the game</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled <strong>January 30</strong> launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, we sent a few questions to Bandai Namco Studios to uncover more details about CODE VEIN II. The answers were provided by CODE VEIN II producer <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong>-san and game director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>-san. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-character-creator-demo-release-date-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Character Creator demo will be released on January 23</a>, one week before the full game's debut.</p>

<p><strong>What were some of the challenges your team faced when it came to overhauling the combat and giving it more impact in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> In the previous game, players opted to play without a partner to focus solely on combat. To give players the option to explore alongside a partner while focusing on enemy encounters, <strong>we’ve introduced a new “Assimilation” mechanic to the partner system in this installment</strong>.</p>



<p>We rebuilt the partner system from scratch to ensure players can choose between the traditional “Summoning” mechanic and the newly added “Assimilation” mechanic, while also incorporating cooperative elements such as the Restorative Offering mechanic.</p>



<p><strong>If Code Vein II is in a separate universe with no connections to the first title, why go with a numbered sequel rather than calling it something different?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura: </strong>This second installment in the series continues the core concept of CODE VEIN: challenging, exploration-focused action alongside a partner character. By introducing time travel and the idea of intervening in a character's past, we felt that we could powerfully depict the drama of two species—humans and Revenants—living in different timelines.</p>



<p><strong>However, we also considered that if players experience returning to the past and altering it, and then ultimately encounter the continuation point of the previous game, they might feel the urge to intervene in that world as well. We felt that if we allowed this, it would negate the lives of the characters from the previous game, and the stories players experienced themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Considering these points, we ultimately decided to create a new story in a world distinct from the previous one. For these reasons, while this is the second installment in the series, it depicts a story set in a different world.</p>



<p><strong>What was the design philosophy your team had in mind when it came to creating the levels and encounters in CODE VEIN II? Is this intended to be more difficult than the original title?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> We've taken care to prevent unreasonable melee encounters from occurring, allowing players to stay focused on combat. Even when group battles do occur, this game features an enemy group-behavior control system that maintains a satisfying level of challenge while letting players enjoy the back-and-forth combat against enemies.</p>



<p><strong>How much player agency will there be when it comes to the time travel? Can players choose not to change events in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura:</strong> Travel between the present and past worlds is relatively unrestricted. Even while progressing the story in the past, you can return to the present world and explore it. <strong>As the story advances, you will encounter several major turning points where you must choose whether to return to the past.</strong> At these points, it is possible to advance the story without intervening in the past more than necessary.</p>



<p><strong>How many routes/endings will there be in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> While we can’t share specific numbers, we can say that <strong>the game includes multiple scenario branches and endings</strong> that reflect the choices and changes players make throughout their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
