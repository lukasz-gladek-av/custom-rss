            <p>
Despite many others disagreeing with this stance, I am of the opinion that it's completely fine that we'll likely never get a "classic" 3D Zelda game again. By that I mean, the whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> format is definitely the direction Nintendo will continue to go in, they've just been too popular. However, I understand the desire for such an experience all the same, and I think Demi and the Fractured Dream might be able to scratch that itch.
</p>
<p>
Announced during today's Annapurna Direct, Demi has you playing as, uh, Demi! A "voidsent" born into a world with a cursed fate he's trying to avoid. It's the debut title from Yarn Owl, and honestly, it really does kind of look like they went "hey wanna make a '90s era Zelda game?" That's not a knock against it to be clear, as it's also a nicely stylish and swish looking game.

<p>
I often find that games inspired by the 3D Zeldas can look and feel a bit too flat, or uninspired. Demi the game has a real strong vibe going for it, with Demi the character appealing to my own sensibilities quite a lot. I very much vibe with his deer boy vibe, his sword with a handle made from what looks like a tree branch is cool as heck, and yeah, I even like that he literally just has Link's pointy, droopy hat but in blue. Combat looks nice and smooth too, though that's something I'd have to try out for myself at some point to comment on it properly.
</p>
<p>
As of right now it doesn't have a release date, but you can probably already guess that it's coming to PC given that I covered it here.

<p>2K Games and Gearbox Software confirmed this <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">on social media today</a>, mentioning how the team does not take this decision lightly. The aim is to deliver the "best possible experience", so this version needs more development time.</p>
<p>While a new launch date for Switch 2 hasn't been revealed just yet, the aim is to line it up with the addition of cross saves, which are currently in the works. In accordance with Nintendo's policy, digital pre-orders have also been cancelled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p>
<p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, Sept. 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact <a href="https://t.co/p0U8UeGs49" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://bit.ly/4niZo7h</a>. For physical pre-orders, please reach out to the corresponding retailer.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borderlands 4 was originally released for PC, Xbox X|S and PlayStation 5 earlier this month on 12th September 2025. Our colleagues at Push Square thought the shift to an open world was the "right move", but couldn't ignore the console version's "problematic performance".</p>
<p>Before this latest development update, the Nintendo Switch 2 version was originally scheduled for 3rd October 2025.</p>

			<p>When Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 would be launching on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">October 3, 2025</a>, before delivering the news, he started to act as if he was about to deliver bad news, that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game wasn't going to make it out before the end of 2025. He then happily and excitedly announced that it would be arriving on October 3.</p>



<p>Well, so much for that. This evening, Gearbox took to the <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">official Borderlands X (formerly Twitter) account</a> to announce that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 has been delayed. It will no longer be released on October 3. In fact, we don't know when it will be released, because Gearbox didn't provide a new release date or release window, and we'll just have to wait for an update when Gearbox has "<em>fully adjusted</em>" its plans.</p>



<p>On top of that, in line with Nintendo's eShop policy, all digital pre-orders of the game are being cancelled, so you'll have to pre-order it again whenever a new date is announced. You can go ahead and cancel your pre-order yourself, or it will happen automatically this Friday, September 26, 2025. If you have a physical pre-order, you'll have to deal with the retailer you got it from to figure out your next steps there.</p>



<p>"<em>Greetings, Vault Hunters,</em>" the studio began in its statement. "<em>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.

</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate news for Borderlands fans who were hoping to play Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, if it had kept its original release date, but it's not exactly surprising considering the myriad of technical issues the game has faced on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it makes it out before the end of this year, which would make Pitchford's joke from his video in July still applicable. Though between all the fixes Gearbox is trying to implement on the versions of the game that's already out in players' hands, it can't help but feel unlikely that the Switch 2 version will be pushed to the back of the priority line, and we won't see it arrive until 2026.</p>

As she attempts to shed the guilt of her past, she works to become a force for good in an area known as the Red Expanse – a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p>

<p>That backdrop opens from the jump, and we’re treated to a quiet opening in a place Clem calls home. It’s framed as a “day in the life,” and it’s easy to see why. Following a quick call, Clem can explore and check off tasks from a list located at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>These tasks range from simple, daily life activities such as eating a meal, grabbing mail, and collecting water, to accepting bounties, which make up the core of the combat-based missions away from home.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=giUBV7fD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=qfaw1GEh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Within those tasks, Clem can do things like individual cooking, where she’ll need specific ingredients to make dishes listed in a recipe book. There are other books she can find and read as well, which expand her knowledge of the game.</p>

<p>At her home, Clem can also prepare fuel, equip and paint her mech, and craft melee weapons and ammunition. There’s really a lot to do, just enjoying the life simulation aspect of Bounty Star. You could probably spend hours tinkering around and even working on your skills by taking part in some target practice.</p>

<p>Further customization comes into play with Clem’s mech, or the Desert Raptor MKII. This is important because it lets you mess around with different weapons like a knife or hammer, or different guns, and you can test them out for yourself out on the actual missions.</p>

<p>These missions, or bounties, are initiated by accepting them from the map in Clem’s home. There are two available for this demo, “The Full Moon Gang”, and “Bad Business”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bounty takes place up north in a place called Coyote Wash, where a large gang has taken up residence. The goal? Take them out, because they’re all too dangerous.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250922171511_1.jpg?itok=RgDJZ73N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250922171511_1.jpg?itok=uCyyDvdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The second bounty is located in the south of the map and requires Clem to knock out a bunch of heavy equipment. So it’s not all just sweeping up enemies – it seems there are different types of missions, all of which have hefty pay-outs.</p>

<p>Engaging with each bounty is relatively simple, and Clem is pretty much dropped into the fray right away. The Desert Raptor takes a bit to get used to, but it’s a powerful tool against the different types of opponents. Ranged weaponry is useful against flying enemies, while melee strikes can take out those on the ground. Clem can engage a target lock-on, too, just to be safe.</p>

<p>It can feel overwhelming at first, and if Clem fails (that is, the Raptor is too damaged), she’ll be asked to restart or you can just head back to base. A lot of it seems to come down to using the Desert Raptor’s tools and recognizing the most effective way to dispatch different enemy types. There’s also some practice dummies around for weapons testing, which was a nice little detail.</p>

<p>While the<em> Bounty Star</em> demo doesn’t go on too long outside of the life sim and bounty activities, it’s pretty clear there’s going to be a lot to do here. There’s a whole map we haven’t explored, or can explore at this point, but that’s what the full game is hopefully for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, <em>Bounty Star</em> seems like a unique twist on the daily life genre, so we’ll just have to see how Clem’s full story fits into all of that when it releases next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive is readying a new round of games to shore up their publishing slate heading into this year. During a special presentation at Tokyo Game Show, the publisher revealed three new titles spanning a variety of different genres.</p>

<p>First up from developer Marumittu Games comes a puzzle-adventure game called <em>D-topia</em>. In <em>D-topia</em>, players assume the role of a maintenance worker known as a Facilitator who works at the <em>D-topia</em> residential facility. Their job is to address the people’s concerns, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets in this oddly perfect society managed by AI.</p>

<p><em>D-topia</em> has a large focus on exploration and nuanced choices that delve deep into the human heart of this perfect world as the story progresses. It’s due for launch on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Annapurna’s next reveal is a musical narrative adventure called <em>People of Note </em>in development by Iridium Studios. The hook here is that it’s a turn-based RPG and a full-on musical rolled into one. <em>People of Note</em> promises a heartfelt story, choreographed cinematic musical sequences, and a battle system based on an interactive sequence of musical expressions and abilities.</p>

<p><em>People of Note</em> will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Last but not least, we’ve got <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream,</em>&nbsp;an action-adventure game created by Yarn Owl. As the title suggests, players take on the role of Demi, a voidsent born in the world of Somus who seeks to escape his cursed fate.</p>

<p>As he’s guided by a mysterious voice and aided by an acolyte named Mergo, Demi will journey across diverse yet treacherous lands to fulfill his destiny. <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a love letter to classic hack-and-slash action-adventure games, complete with environmental puzzles and platforming. It’s due out in 2026 for PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>It’s been a while since we saw a new entry in the Splinter Cell series, but fans can look forward to the return of Sam Fisher when he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-anime-needed-to-rip-the-spine-out-of-the-source-material-showrunner-says/1100-6534838/" data-ref-id="1100-6534838">sneaks onto Netflix</a> with a fresh animated series on October 14. Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan, Logan) will voice the Third Echelon operative for its eight-episode run, and if you’re excited about the upcoming series, but have already played through the stealth-action video game series, consider checking out the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=0425201686,0425204227,0425212785,0425218244,0425231046,0425231445,1405914394,B0DZD85MQD,B0DZHQV5XM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy Splinter Cell novels</a> that both the video games and the new Netflix animated series are based on. Better yet, many of the books are discounted at Amazon, making now the ideal time to dive into the espionage thriller series.</p><p>Like many other books, video games, or TV series bearing the late author's name, Tom Clancy never actually wrote any of the Splinter Cell books. Instead, they’re written by David Michaels, Peter Telep, and other popular authors who follow a similar format to Clancy's earlier works.</p><p>If you’re just getting started, it makes sense to start with the first book, aptly titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clancys-Splinter-Cell-David-Michaels/dp/0425201686?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</a>, which is on sale for just $8.94 (was $10). The book introduces Third Echelon, Fisher, and the many people on his team who help him survive out in the field. Fans of the Splinter Cell video games will recognize the tense military espionage action and Sam Fisher’s morbid sense of humor. From there, the Splinter Cell book series includes eight more novels, for a total of nine (so far). The direct follow-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Barracuda-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425204227?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda</a>, while book three, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checkmate-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425212785?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Checkmate</a>, and book four, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425218244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Fallout</a>, introduce new storylines.</p><p>While the first few books are largely original stories that only lightly touch on the video games, several of the later novels tie into or outright retell the events of several games in the series--including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conviction-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231046?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Conviction</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endgame-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231445?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Endgame</a>, which serve as the basis for the game also titled Splinter Cell: Conviction. Then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell-Blacklist/dp/1405914394?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath</a> details events that take place after the last game, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, making it a great choice for fans who've been waiting for Ubisoft to resurrect the dormant series.

            <p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> has revealed three new games in its latest digital showcase, all of which are playable at this week's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Annapurna is known for publishing well-loved games like Outer Wilds, Stray, the most recent To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-is-eurogamers-game-of-2023">Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year Cocoon</a>. There are always high expectations, then, as to what it's supporting next.</p>
<p>The first of these three games is D-topia, a puzzle-adventure game from Marumittu Games that features a minimalist sci-fi aesthetic as a young boy seeks to question how to find happiness if life is a utopia?</p>
<p>Expect choice-based gameplay and a very cute grumpy cat. It's set for release next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<figure>

<p>Next up is People of Note, described as "a full fledged musical, condensed into a video game" - specifically, a turn-based RPG. The trailer shows a young female star in a singing contest, a colourful futuristic world, and musical battles against strange creatures.</p><p>Of course, any music game like this lives and breathes by its songs - thankfully, this sounds like it could have some Kpop Demon Hunters-esque bangers. It's coming from Iridium Studios and will be out next year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>Lastly, there's the Zelda-like adventure Demi and the Fractured Dream from developer Yarn Owl. A "tribute to classic action-adventure games", it features hack and slash combat with puzzle solving and platforming, plus ethereal visuals.</p>
<p>Once again, it's due out next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>"Annapurna Interactive is making its debut at this year's Tokyo Game Show and we couldn't imagine a better way to participate in this iconic event than by showcasing three great new titles from amazing indie studios," said Leanne Loombe, head of games at Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>"From the wonderful puzzle adventure D-topia, to the catchy, innovative turn-based musical RPG People of Note, and a beautiful love letter to the classic action-adventure genre with Demi and the Fractured Dream, these games embody our vision of supporting world-class developers who are pushing the boundaries of artist story telling."</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">majority of Annapurna's staff quit in a mass exodus</a> following a dispute with the company's owner.</p>
<p>Today's showcase was the second since then, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">February's showcase</a> featuring a number of games now available.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to kick off the Nintendo Switch 2’s first big fall season but it’s now been indefinitely delayed as Gearbox Entertainment works to deliver the “best possible experience” for fans on the new portable console. It’s a surprisingly last-minute move for a game that was supposed to ship in less than two weeks, on October 3. The pivot comes after weeks of heated debate over the loot shooter’s performance on other platforms.</p> <p><span>“We need to share that the release of<em> Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Tuesday evening. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters – We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development…</p> <p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The studio said it hopes to peg the new release date for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 to the arrival of cross saves for all versions of the game, but didn’t provide a release window for that either. “We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span><span>In the meantime, all digital pre-orders on the eShop have been canceled in accordance with a Nintendo policy, and will be refunded starting September 26.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The sudden delay comes after lots of complaints about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s performance on PC</a> as well as some concerns on other consoles, including an apparent memory leak that makes the game run worse if you play it continuously for long stretches of time without quitting out and relaunching. The game is capped at 30fps on Switch 2, and initial hands-on impressions with the game suggested it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DosYcQK5y2Q">ran well enough</a>, though experiences on Steam Deck have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCMeKugDOQ">reportedly been subpar</a>. Digital Foundry’s analysis of the game across various platforms has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWW6qwjFBA">less than glowing</a>.</p> <p>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAY7wUyCggCEAAYgAQYogQyBwgDEAAY7wUyCggEEAAYogQYiQUyBggFEEUYPNIBCDM1MjhqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">all over social media</a> since the sci-fi sequel launched earlier this month, but hasn’t yet weighed in on the delay as of publishing time.</p>

              <p>Star Wars is the number one selling license of LEGO, even surpassing Harry Potter in fan enthusiasm. Most Star Wars LEGO sets have wonderful reviews, usually 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon and both children and adult fans enjoy them. One set that’s flying off the shelves, especially with its all-time lowest price just before Prime Day, is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi shuttle: Now offered for $54, where it was once $79</a>, it’s a bargain if you’re looking to revisit the galaxy far, far away adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Step Into the World of Star Wars Adventure</h2>
<p>This LEGO set mimics the streamlined and signature look of Ahsoka Tano’s starship in the well-known animated TV series. <strong>With 599 pieces</strong>, the set provides a satisfying build experience that’s <strong>perfect for kids 9 and up</strong> but suitable for adult collectors who desire a displayable model as well. The shuttle includes an opening cockpit that is well-suited to house the included LEGO mini-figures.</p>



<p>The collection includes <strong>four detailed mini-figures: Ahsoka herself, with two lightsabers; Sabine Wren, with two blasters; Professor Huyang, with a wrench; and Marrok, with a double-bladed lightsaber</strong>.</p>
<p>Functionality gets its proper place in this model with two stud shooters and storage bays that can hide tools, weapons and accessories and add realism and interactive play. The landing gear folds up neatly on the shuttle, automatically placing the wings in flight mode.</p>
<p>What makes this offer different from the typical Star Wars attraction is the combination of quality, level of detail, and now phenomenal pricing: Dropping to an all-time low of $54, the set gives children and collectors a chance to pick up a highly rated model at a friendly price at just the right time for holiday shopping or adding to a collection.</p>

Publications like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MSNBC</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/15/washington-post-columnist-karen-attiah-fired-charlie-kirk/86169162007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> have yielded to far-right pressure, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as did ABC</a> in the case of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/workers-are-getting-fired-over-posts-mocking-charlie-kirk-s-death/ar-AA1MBTTF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schools, airlines, and even NASDAQ</a> have given staff the boot as the likes of JD Vance and Elon Musk cheer them on from their bully pulpits.&nbsp;</p><p>The witch hunt has made its way to the world of video games as well, with an artist at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> developer Sucker Punch <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing her job</a> days after Kirk’s death following social media jokes about Kirk and an ensuing mob effort to get her fired. Late last week, a community manager on SWAT game <em>Ready Or Not</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was fired</a> as a result of furor around their take that “nothing of value was lost” when Kirk died. This week, <em>Storm Lancers</em> developer ProbablyMonsters announced it had <a href="https://x.com/prblyMONSTERS/status/1969909019834999137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired an employee</a>, seemingly its global marketing manager, following <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/probablymonsters-is-the-latest-studio-to-fire-someone-for-posting-about-charlie-kirk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of comments</a> like "Charlie Kirk's epitaph should read 'Worth it for the second amendment.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A firestorm of debate ensued in <em>Ready Or Not</em>’s Discord, where the community manager was active and generally well-liked, with some messages viewed by Aftermath lamenting the studio’s decision while others came to the conclusion that the community manager got their just desserts for “[celebrating] the death of someone for speaking their mind,” not even remotely detecting the irony in celebrating a government-encouraged movement that’s trying to get people fired for… speaking their minds.</p><p>Sucker Punch and <em>Ready Or Not</em> developer Void Interactive did not reply to Aftermath’s requests for comment as of this publishing. A ProbablyMonsters representative declined to provide additional details.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There are no dogwhistles anymore.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Those behind an email campaign targetting <em>Warhammer </em>publisher Games Workshop have claimed that they <a href="https://x.com/pr_of_hell451/status/1968757256540811624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully got an employee suspended</a> for saying on Facebook that he isn’t shedding any tears over Kirk’s death because Kirk was "a fascist cunt carrying enormous amounts of water for a side that has no compunctions committing structural and systemic political violence against the working class and the people of Gaza," but Games Workshop has not publicly confirmed the suspension or replied to Aftermath’s request for additional details.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, aggrieved Kirk stans have <a href="https://x.com/Microsoft/status/1966626714148368766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced a statement out of Microsoft</a>, seemingly in relation to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777664/elon-musk-charlie-kirk-satya-nadella-fire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments from Blizzard employees</a>, about how it takes “matters like this very seriously” and is “currently reviewing each individual situation,” as well as Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned</a> “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” (Bandai Namco has since deleted the statement.) Bethesda was also <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/clip-removed-fascism-row" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressured into deleting an <em>Indiana Jones</em> promotional post</a> in which Indy pet a cat and said, “You don’t care much about those fascists, do you?,” because apparently the people behind these campaigns have just decided to say the quiet part out loud now.</p><p>The Gamergate 2.0 mob responsible for recent tea kettle storms, marshalled by the likes of nearly-60-year-old games industry washout Mark “Grummz” Kern and MMO streamer-turned-political-pundit Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, has been kicking around for quite some time, beginning to percolate even prior to the emergence of the modern anti-woke movement and then roaring to life on the back of last year’s still-ridiculous <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Baby Inc conspiracy theory</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events have, unsurprisingly, galvanized the aforementioned influencers and their ilk, with Kern, Hoyt, the KotakuInAction subreddit, and a menagerie of other YouTubers and community members plucking game developers who’ve spoken ill – or even not entirely reverently – of Kirk from relative obscurity and instructing followers to get them cancelled (which usually means fired). While Hoyt has <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1966430272838074510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised to</a> “do this until [offending developers] are all gone or the companies that protect them have their reputations destroyed beyond repair,” he’s spent the past week and change out of action following the passing of his father. In his stead, a segment of his Twitter community, <a href="https://x.com/i/communities/1853165142885679514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roach Ranch</a>, has taken up the cause of naming and shaming developers who shuffle a toe out of line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tandem to this effort, a Steam user created a curator page called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915-CharlieTweetsDetected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CharlieTweetsDetected</a> that lists games worked on by developers who “celebrated the tragedy” of Kirk’s death. Reminiscent of a similar Sweet Baby Inc Detected page from 2024, it currently boasts over 28,000 followers and has already given a thumbs-down to over 100 games.&nbsp;</p><p>This all sounds bad, and in many ways, it is. Developers and personalities identified by these groups are facing increased harassment – some for the first time in their careers.</p><p>"This is my first time getting swept up in a harassment campaign," a developer who made Charlie Kirk-related comments on social media and who was granted anonymity out of concern that speaking openly could spur further harassment told Aftermath. "It was surreal to watch a video where I was directly referenced along with my colleagues ... where [Asmongold] said he wanted to ‘ruin our lives,’ and that we were ‘animals – and that's exactly what they are, you shouldn't view them as people, you shouldn't view them as a person with a political disagreement with you, these are violent animals.’ It's practically a 1:1 quote for Goebbels’ ‘These are not humans, but animals’ <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-animals-hitler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> about Jewish people. There are no dogwhistles anymore, and not only has YouTube kept that video up – and, I'm assuming, monetized – but that video has been seen several million times."</p><figure><blockquote><p>This is the first time I've actually had to recommend other people lock down their accounts on the basis of me being targeted. You just don't know who else they're going to find an excuse to harass.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Some have been forced to at least temporarily shut down social media accounts to avoid being bombarded with harassment, which the mob has taken as (spurious) evidence that they have been fired from their jobs.</p><p>“What's remarkable about this instance,” another developer who made Charlie Kirk-related comments on social media and who was granted anonymity to avoid further harassment told Aftermath, “is that a) at least in my case, they have been much more successful in getting their followers to expend the effort to harass me on an individual basis, b) the campaign has been much more sustained, whereas usually it dies off rather quickly when they don't get what they want, and c) they are expanding their field of targets nigh indiscriminately. You usually see them targeting one person at a time, more often than not marginalized people who aren't high up in the company, but this time they're happy to add even C-suiters to their list. This is the first time I've actually had to recommend other people lock down their accounts on the basis of me being targeted. You just don't know who else they're going to find an excuse to harass, and that part in particular is alarming.”</p><p>Kirk zealots have crept into unexpected places as well – for example, the personal Discord of an Australian fighting game commentator Teq, who was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theteqnique.tv/post/3lywxtam7lc2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> from a community-run <em>Street Fighter</em> organization called SFAustralia after saying “get got idiot” in response to Kirk’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm incredibly surprised at how effective and far-reaching the campaign has been,” Teq told Aftermath. “I think what was particularly shocking for our scene is how POC- and queer-centric the fighting game community is, so to see it rearing its head all the way down here in Australia blindsided us all."&nbsp;</p><p>Another SFA member was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/midnightaus.bsky.social/post/3lyxmu3zbos27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed not long after</a>, also for comments made outside SFA’s channels.</p><p>But while some companies and organizations have beaten a hasty retreat in the face of this campaign, you can still – as of this writing, at least – count the number of people whose actual jobs it’s impacted on one hand, compared to the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/18/charlie-kirk-comments-prompt-firings-across-us/86216872007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100+ who’ve been fired or disciplined in other sectors</a>. This despite an ongoing campaign with dozens of targets (hundreds if you count the CharlieTweetsDetected list). The broader shape of the grievance machine, it seems, has not changed all that much in light of recent events, and given that some version of this has been going on for years, savvier companies have grown wise to its tactics.</p><p>"Generally studios are pretty good at identifying the rabble as just that and protecting their employees," another game creator, who was granted anonymity out of concern over further harassment and who has been a repeat target of harassment mobs, told Aftermath. "Hell, when those guys lost their minds over a stray tweet of mine and tried to get me fired from [a company], the subreddits they posted in also just came to my defense and shut them down. They are certainly good at generating harassment, but no, I haven't personally seen any real ramifications of their campaigns. … I and others have found that these idiots generally lose interest and move on to something new given time. If there was a legit way to stop it that would be great, but there’s basically no path to that outside of litigation, and I cannot afford that."</p><p>One streamer in whose direction Roach Ranch’s Eye of Sauron recently turned wasn’t even aware.</p><p>"I've barely heard a peep,” they told Aftermath. “Been dogpiled by Gamergate people in the past, [and] that led to torrents of abuse/threats. [I was] harassed to the point I had to close my account for weeks at a time before. Seem to have dodged a bullet this time, I guess?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>They are certainly good at generating harassment, but no, I haven't personally seen any real ramifications of their campaigns. … I and others have found that these idiots generally lose interest and move on to something new given time.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The creator of <em>Cruelty Squad</em>, an unabashedly political immersive sim for which a fan made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdcVAKSofAs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreation of Charlie Kirk’s shooting</a>, has gone so far as to poke the hornet’s nest, <a href="https://x.com/CSoftproducts/status/1968340767719690466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taunting</a> those attempting to review bomb the game and <a href="https://x.com/CSoftproducts/status/1968565358781972806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly boasting</a> of a resultant sales bump.</p><p>“The amount of negative reviews has been quite low,” the <em>Cruelty Squad</em> developer Consumer Softproducts, who shared the Charlie Kirk map on Bluesky, told Aftermath. “I’ve also noticed that many of their [Twitter] posts haven’t actually gained much traction, with my quote tweets of them getting more likes than the original posts. Also, the sales count went up by around 40 percent compared to recent average.”</p><p>"I think even the conservatives generally don't give a shit about the Charlie Kirk stuff,” they added. “They're obviously not going to communicate that because of their internal thought policing."</p><p>The creator of the <em>Cruelty Squad</em> Charlie Kirk map agrees.</p><p>“The subsequent right-wing virtue signalling was just surreal to watch," the map creator told Aftermath. "It's all so fake and performative and clearly inorganic. They're not even actually making political or moral statements. It's just whining and grandstanding. Nobody on the left or right actually sees Charlie as a human being during this whole thing – just a tool or component to use. So might as well put him in a videogame as a low-poly caricature barely resembling a man because it's funny."</p><p>The CharlieTweetsDetected Steam list and sustained harassment campaigns of developers on major games, you’d think, would lead to a flood of negative reviews, but even games like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> – a Roach Ranch fixation – have only seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trickle</a>.</p><p>The developer who’s weathering their first real harassment storm described the impact as “relatively mild.”</p><p>"I'm lucky enough that my workplace has seemed to come to the conclusion that there is more value in retaining me as an employee and providing me resources to support me through the harassment rather than firing me," they said. "I don't feel that this harassment campaign is necessarily new or different for the most part; queer people and women in games – especially queer, women of color in games – have been bearing the brunt of targeted harassment campaigns simply for who they [are] since the Gamergate days. Of course there's the open secret that Gamergate never went away, but rather just pivoted to being the alt-right community, so the harassment never truly ended."&nbsp;</p><p>The mob has cast a wide net, though, and its harassment campaigns vary in severity. While some are quickly abandoned, others have persisted for days or weeks. And of course, a few have resulted in firings. Though the developer who’s had to tell other people to lock down accounts remains employed at a major studio, they don’t like the precedent a (so far) small handful of video game companies are setting.</p><p>“In my opinion, every company that has caved to their demands has contributed to the harassment and climate of fear the rest of us are enduring, and game companies that have done so, in particular, have painted a target on the back of every single person in this industry,” the developer said. “Frankly, I’m pissed.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;There's the open secret that Gamergate never went away, but rather just pivoted to being the alt-right community, so the harassment never truly ended.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I recently heard someone say they find it disturbing that the American right reacts with the same amount of outrage to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/23/1150844961/tucker-carlsons-war-on-m-ms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">green M&amp;M</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/cracker-barrel-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cracker Barrel</a>, and the killing of a public figure. This lack of focus is a feature – not a bug – but it also means their movements are uniquely prone to running out of steam unless someone is constantly shoveling fresh fuel onto the fire. Gamergate in its various incarnations has been at it longer than just about any other, and its basic rhythm is revealing: Figureheads like Kern and Hoyt provide new controversies every week, especially as core crusades wane. Barely anybody cares about Sweet Baby anymore; dozens of uniting causes have come and gone since. Kirk is the latest, but eventually the bloom will fall off that rose as well. A lack of overall effectiveness and general disinterest in the review bomb efforts that often undergird these things suggest that might already be happening. Time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to suggest a lack of caution or alarm, but rather to say that fascism is neither inevitable nor unassailable. The component parts of the modern movement, especially, are rusty and in need of constant replacement – a weak point as much as it is a necessity in this era of social-media-fried attention spans. While more companies than usual are capitulating to Gamergate 2.0’s latest all-out assault, a significant number are evidently aware of its tactics, demonstrating that even if this kind of grievance movement regularly swaps out pieces, the larger apparatus can still break down. That approach renders it necessarily hollow – less a Trojan horse and more a one-trick pony.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it is worth remembering that despite the seeming wave of Kirk-a-mania sweeping the nation, this is all heinously unpopular outside a specific far-right bubble that’s being inflated to look much bigger than it actually is by corporate cowardice. Trump’s approval rating <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to drop</a> following Kirk’s death, with just 39 percent of Americans giving him a thumbs up. The Kimmel suspension resulted in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bencollins.bsky.social/post/3lzbv62abuk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-high search interest in deleting Disney Plus</a>. Disney has already <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oliverdarcy.bsky.social/post/3lzh5lpfips2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elected to lift the suspension</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More alarming, however, is the fact that the right has spent years constructing <a href="https://defector.com/the-united-states-of-snitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an infinitely re-deployable Snitch Force</a> just in time for the government to begin openly cracking down on free speech. Kimmel’s suspension – which came hours after Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, threatened to “take action” against ABC – is the most high-profile example, but Trump and his cronies have repeatedly spoken of a much wider crackdown on <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/texas-congressman-says-trans-people-need-to-be-taken-off-the-streets-after-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans people</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-republicans-cancel-culture-wars-rcna232152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left-wing organizations</a>, and anything that falls under the extremely broad umbrella of “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-sign-order-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization-2025-09-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antifa</a>.” In order to effectively enforce the speech-curtailing policies to come, they’ll need citizens to tell on each other early and often.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Every company that has caved to their demands has contributed to the harassment and climate of fear the rest of us are enduring.</p></blockquote></figure><p>A version of this is already playing out elsewhere in the gaming world. For more than a year, a group of streamers, their communities, and increasingly, <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a> have <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed to get leftist politics streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker banned</a> from Twitch, largely on the laughable basis that his Palestine advocacy constitutes open support of terrorism. This movement has unsurprisingly been emboldened by Kirk’s killing, <a href="https://x.com/Grummz/status/1966558139131850924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syncing up with Kern and co</a> to suggest that Piker is a prime example of the “violent” left-wing rhetoric that’s inspiring all the nation’s killers (<a href="https://theconversation.com/right-wing-extremist-violence-is-more-frequent-and-more-deadly-than-left-wing-violence-what-the-data-shows-265367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source: trust me, bro</a>). It is only with this context in mind that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s decision to request Twitch’s presence – in addition to that of Discord, Steam, and Reddit – <a href="https://aftermath.site/us-oversight-committee-online-radicalization-hearing-discord-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at an upcoming Kirk-inspired radicalization hearing</a> makes even the slightest bit of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s impossible to predict exactly what committee members will do on October 8, there’s a very good chance they’ll badger Twitch CEO Dan Clancy about Piker’s continued presence on the platform, something I don’t imagine his bosses at Amazon would love. Already, Twitch has <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-what-mizkif-say-charlie-kirk-s-death-streamer-gets-banned-twitch-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended</a> popular streamer and <a href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OTK</a> co-founder Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo for jokes about Kirk’s death, though the company wound up <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1969435549652996150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">un-suspending him</a> mere hours later. The next few weeks, then, will prove to be a litmus test of Twitch and Amazon’s ability to weather Trump’s censorious storm.&nbsp;</p><p>The developer who’s had to tell others to lock their accounts believes those in charge of gaming companies should understand what they're dealing with by now.</p><p>“If leaders are convinced that caving will take the heat off of them, or that it's worth getting rid of ‘troublesome’ employees because they will never say the wrong thing themselves, they have failed in their absolute bare-minimum duty to pay attention to the landscape of the industry,” the developer said. “Yes, the situation is more severe and more urgent now, but the overall trend has been the same since Gamergate, and there's absolutely no excuse for not understanding that.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism"><h3>I Love Silksong Even When It Bugs Me</h3></a><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is a once-in-a-generation platformer and a labor of love.

              <p>Valve awarded Steam user SonixLegend a special achievement on Tuesday. It’s called the “Game Collector” badge, and it was bestowed upon SonixLegend after they purchased over 40,000 Steam games. As far as we know, they’re the only person to have ever done it. Cool! But also how?</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/"><em>Gamesradar</em> reports</a>, SonixLegend <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/">has a reputation</a> in the Steam community for being the super-user even among super-users. Based in Shanghai, China according to their public records, they’ve been active on Valve’s PC gaming storefront for over a decade and have an account level of 303. They’ve been collecting games for years and it’s finally caught up with them in the form of a new Steam record.</p> <p>Thanks to places like SteamDB, we can glean all sorts of weird info about SonixLegend’s collection. Technically, they have 97,000 titles in their account, but majority of them are junk that don’t qualify for the achievement. If you were somehow able to magically refund everything in the library at today’s prices, the total catalog would be worth over <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/">$640,000</a>. Man, would it suck to lose the password to that account or get banned for breaking Valve’s TOS.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628034">Valve / SteamDB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/"><em>Polygon</em> estimated</a> that it would take over seven years to beat every game in SonixLegend’s collection. But at the rate they’re actually going, that will probably never happen. SonixLegend’s actual favorite game, ironically enough, is a free-to-play co-op shooter called <em>Alien Swarm</em>. It came out back in 2010. They have played it for over 550 hours. They also have over 100 Steam products that cost more than $200 each.</p> <p>But while SonixLegend is currently winning Steam, they’re hardly the only person gunning for the 40K achievement. A <a href="https://steamdb.info/badge/13/">leaderboard shows</a> nearly 20 other Steam users who all have over 30,000 games in their libraries. SonixLegend appears to be in a semi-direct race with at least one in particular who goes by&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198017975643/" rel="nofollow">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>. They’re the current runner-up with 39,497 qualifying games. Just, uh, another 533 to take first place. The current value of their library is $542,444. But being the first to 45,000, assuming Valve adds an achievement for that? Priceless.</p> <p>The money for Gabe Newell’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">next yacht</a> has to come from somewhere.</p>

With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> having received an indefinite delay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">back in June</a>, that just leaves one game to test whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. While this one has been cooking for a while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-prepares-to-stake-its-claim-in-making-extraction-shooters-popular-with-an-october-release-date">it actually has a release date</a>, October 30th. There's been a few tests along the way, and it turns out the devs have one last one in them!
</p>
<p>
The good thing about this test - they're calling it a Server Slam - is that it's completely open to everyone. You don't need any kind of access code, and despite this announcement coming with the shooter's pre-order trailer, you do not in fact have to pre-order it either. This test is taking place between October 17th and 19th, across PC and console, and essentially it's just to get as many people playing as possible to ensure there are no server hiccups when the game actually launches.
</p>

<p>
Apparently this test will take place on the Dam Battlegrounds map for those in the know, and you'll be able to get a taste of the game's progression, crafting, and quest systems. It's worth noting that none of this progress will carry over to the full game, so don't get too deep into it. You'll get a backpack cosmetic as a little treat in the full game for your troubles at least.
</p><p>
I've said it before on this site and I'll say it again, I'm not particularly big on shooters, but I'm always curious about a burgeoning genre or subgenre. Sure extraction shooters aren't exactly new, but they are quite hard to recommend given how easy it can be to lose progress. Not sure if I'll be jumping in at launch, though I'll be keeping my eye on it to see how things go at least.
</p>
<p>
Arc Raiders is out October 30th.

              <p>Starting a Pokemon card collection can be exciting but also overwhelming when you’re figuring out where to begin. If you’re just getting into it, here’s a deal that’s hard to pass up: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">an assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards for just $5, down from $9</a>. That’s around 40% off the regular price, and $0.10 for each card. Now, you will not be opening up rare cards, and there could be duplicates that show up, but this is a wonderful way to start your collection under way without spending too much money.</p>

<h2>How to Build Your Pokemon Collection with a Budget Boost</h2>
<p>This mixed bag is a <strong>mix of standard Pokemon cards and energy cards</strong> from a variety of series with a surprise feature that makes it interesting. You never know what you are going to receive in each pack, so the excitement from not knowing which cards appear adds some zip to the action. <strong>Value is in terms of quantity and mix rather than rarity</strong>, so it is ideal for beginners wanting to establish a good foundation set or for backyard collectors who want cheap means of expanding their collection.</p>



<p>The randomness does have some dups but that’s just the bet for bulk purchasing at this price level. Silver lining is that dups can be used to make trades with buddies or strengthen your deck by having multiples of a specific card. Over time, this encourages more interaction with fellow gamers and collectors.</p>
<p><strong>For $5 for 50 cards, this deal lowers the entry price for Pokemon players and collectors</strong>. It is a solid choice if you have been eager to start playing without spending a lot of money upfront.</p>
<p>Sure, you may not get the super-huge ones here, but the thrill is in unpacking the boxes, organizing cards, and discovering new favorites. And for serious players, these base cards provide the foundation for trades and deck enhancements.</p>
