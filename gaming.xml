			<p>This coming Friday, September 12, 2025, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT, Nintendo will host another Nintendo Direct event the day before the 40th anniversary of the release of Super Mario Bros., <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-set-for-mid-september-2025/">confirming reports </a>from the end of last month that a Direct event was coming sometime during mid-September.</p>



<p>The news was announced through the Nintendo Today! mobile app, and will be the second general Nintendo Direct of 2025, as every other Direct event has had a specific focus, whether it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">game-specific Direct</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/4-2-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, which did have multiple game announcements but focused mainly on showcasing the new console.</p>



<p>A post on the official Nintendo of America X (formerly Twitter) account followed the Nintendo Today! app's news, confirming that this is another general Direct just focused on games and that it will be approximately one hour in length. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Sept 12 at 6am PT for a</em> <em>Nintendo Direct! Tune in for roughly 60 minutes of information on upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch games.</em>" </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, we can't know exactly what Nintendo plans to show at this Direct, but the top guess is that we'll finally get a release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond at this event. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea/">rated in South Korea this past July</a>, and was featured at <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/">Toronto's Fan Expo event last month with a playable demo</a> available for attendees. All signs point to it getting a release date announcement soon, and it's a good bet that we'll get that news this Friday.</p>



<p>Besides Metroid news, because it is taking place a day before a major anniversary for the company, this could also be where we finally get our first look at the next mainline 3D Mario game, and learn if Nintendo is indeed making a direct sequel to Odyssey, or if the next game is going in a new direction. Either way, it's doubtful that Nintendo will go the whole event without mentioning the Super Mario Bros. anniversary, so you can expect some news regarding what Nintendo has planned for the date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct show for this month, and it's set to deliver a significant amount of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1965762503821935034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on social media, Nintendo says the Direct, which is scheduled for this Friday at 9am Eastern, will feature "roughly 60 minutes of information" on games coming to both machines, and this one isn't a Nindies show or a third-party showcase; it's a true blue Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't mean it won't feature indies or third-party efforts, but it does hopefully mean we can expect to see what Nintendo itself is cooking up for both Switch consoles for the next year or so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=Fgz1lE3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=DocM9Ngv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully find out what Nintendo is up to in the next Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>This will mark Nintendo's third major Direct of the year; the first was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, just prior to the announcement of the Switch 2, and it was followed by a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">partner show in August</a>&nbsp;and an indie presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">just a few days after that</a>.</p>

<p>This Direct feels particularly significant, however; it's the first opportunity we'll have had since the Switch 2 to see what Nintendo's plans for the future look like, including whether any major releases for the studio's big franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>are in the works.</p>

<p>It's also likely, assuming the game hasn't been delayed, that we'll be getting a release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">the long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</em>during this Direct. The game is still scheduled for a 2025 release, but no specific date has been announced by Nintendo thus far.</p>

<p>Whatever's on the cards, this Direct will be longer than the Japanese gaming giant's shows often are, so we'll hopefully get a good chance to go in-depth on the upcoming Switch 2 and Switch slates.</p>

Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo is currently suing Pocketpair, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for patent infringement, which has already caused the studio to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">change the game's mechanics</a> at least once.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-nvidia%E2%80%99s-geforce-now-rtx-5080-is-better-and-worse-than-i-hoped.1293594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, Nvidia is soft-launching its latest gaming GPUs in the cloud — upgrading its $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate cloud gaming service with RTX 5080 graphics for select games, with more to come down the road. At the same time, it’s also adding thousands more titles to the bring-your-own-games service by letting you install them yourself, while also unlocking a 360Hz mode for ultra-fast desktop monitors, launching a 90Hz version of its Steam Deck app, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming">and more</a>.</p><p>Do all these changes make GeForce Now fundamentally better? Absolutely, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on">it was already pretty good</a>! But while playing I couldn’t escape the thought: it’s a good thing Nvidia isn’t charging extra for most updates, because they’re a little underwhelming right now.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077 is playable with all the Nvidia eye candy — if you use all the Nvidia tricks.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck or MacBook or phone, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 5080 or 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Don’t get me wrong, more power is always welcome, and more power is what I saw. In <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s built-in benchmarks, two of the few I was able to run, Nvidia’s cloud-based RTX 5080 offered anywhere from 25 to 50 percent gains over the old RTX 4080 servers at 4K resolution.</p><p>That’s enough to play the former at near-max settings on a 4K TV, and the latter at 4K <em>if </em>you either sacrifice ray tracing or let Nvidia’s DLSS 4 frame generation add an extra fake frame for every real frame to smooth things out. My <em>Cyberpunk </em>framerate is better than we saw with the physical card!</p><p>But I quickly discovered that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">like with that physical RTX 5080</a>, the company’s marketing is moving faster than its tech can actually go.</p><p>There are so few RTX 5080-enabled games as of launch that I had a hard time finding them, and there’s currently no way to tell until <em>after</em> you launch <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> or <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> that it’s still running on a 4080-class GPU instead.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and mode</h3></th><th><h3>RTX 5080 (average/low fps)</h3></th><th><h3>RTX 4080 (average/low fps)</h3></th><th><h3>Percent increases</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Native 4K max spec</td><td>50 / 39</td><td>36 / 29</td><td>38 / 34 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Native 4K less RT</td><td>65 / 48</td><td>50 / 38</td><td>30 / 26 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, Native 4K Ultra</td><td>85 / 69</td><td>56 / 47</td><td>51 / 46 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Quality</td><td>45 / 41</td><td>31 / 27</td><td>45 / 51 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Balanced</td><td>55 / 49</td><td>39 / 34</td><td>41 / 44 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Balanced 2x FG</td><td>99 / 91</td><td>71 / 63</td><td>39 / 44 percent</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And to get the huge framerate gains that Nvidia’s promising from RTX 5080, you’d need to have its servers generate three fake frames for every real one — which, when you combine it with the lag of cloud gaming, dramatically slows the speed a game reacts to your movements. I didn’t need to spend long trying 3x and 4x frame gen in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to find it was a non-starter for me: the game portrays Indy in his prime, but he suddenly felt like a sluggish old man.</p><p>But I’ll admit 2x frame gen actually felt pretty viable over a cloud connection, at least when plugged directly into my desktop over ethernet.</p><p>On the speedier side of things, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">my colleague Tom Warren</a> tried out <em>Overwatch 2</em> in Nvidia’s new 360Hz mode, and says he found it “easy to be competitive with,” but unfortunately that mode’s only limited to 1080p resolution. “Streaming at 1080p on a 4K monitor wasn’t the best,” he says.</p><p>It’s important to note the point of buying a 360Hz monitor is typically for better reaction times in esports games, not the smooth framerate itself, and Nvidia is getting you nowhere near a true 360Hz (2.78ms) reaction time this way. But Nvidia claims it <em>can</em> get you down to 30 milliseconds, which is incredible for cloud gaming and should be better than a console in your living room. In the <em>Overwatch 2</em> example, Nvidia says it’s only adding 1.8ms of encode, 0.3ms of decode, and 9ms of game engine activity and rendering, to the time it takes for you to press a button and send data across the internet to Nvidia’s servers and back.</p><p>Meanwhile, though the 90Hz Steam Deck app is unequivocally an upgrade for the Steam Deck OLED’s 90Hz screen, making a smoother experience overall, I was surprised to find an RTX 5080 doesn’t necessarily improve performance beyond that. In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, </em>the RTX 5080 wasn’t enough to run the game at 4K on max settings any more than the RTX 4080 was, so I tested at 1440p, and saw roughly the same framerate of 55fps (outdoor battle) to 90fps (indoor environment) regardless of which GPU I was using.</p><p>(Yes, I do recommend streaming at much higher resolutions than 800p to the Steam Deck’s 800p screen, because oversampling makes for a clearer and crisper image with fewer cloud gaming artifacts.)</p><p>Last but not least, I tested Nvidia’s new “Install-to-Play” feature, which should drastically increase the number of games you can play on GeForce Now by letting you install any game that’s opted into Valve’s <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloudgaming">Steam Cloud Play</a>, even if Nvidia hasn’t taken the time to test. There, GeForce Now basically just exposes its copy of Steam so you can install and launch any game you own that wasn’t supported before:</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Those games install even faster than I imagined: it took 17 seconds to install the 1.4GB <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1815570%2FAces__Adventures%2F" rel="sponsored">Aces and Adventures</a></em>; 53 seconds to install the 8GB <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1675830%2F1000xRESIST%2F" rel="sponsored">1000xResist</a></em>, the game I haven’t stopped thinking about all year, 1 minute 22 seconds to install 2.2GB worth of <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>, and and 2 minutes 9 seconds to install <em>Sleeping Dogs’ </em>10.5GB of data.</p><p>But while Install-to-Play works, and quickly enough it might even be OK not to bother paying extra to avoid having to reinstall them every session (persistent storage is $3 for 200GB, $5 for 500GB, or $8 for 1TB per month), it doesn’t yet fill in the majority of GeForce Now’s gaps the way I’d hoped.</p><p>It only added 21 more games to my GeForce Now library. Without Install to Play, I could only access 162 out of my 472 Steam games via Nvidia’s cloud, and that number has only slightly budged. Now I can play <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>System Shock 2</em> and <em>Tomb Raider Anniversary</em> and the <em>Golden Idol</em> games, sure, but realistically I’d just play those natively on the Steam Deck. Perhaps I’d feel differently if I only had a phone or a Chromebook, though. And perhaps we’ll really see the advantage going forward, as it lets Nvidia add new titles far more quickly than before.</p><div><p>Just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming#:~:text=I%20have%20no%20updates%2C%20they%20have%20chosen%20not%20to%20be%20on%20GFN%2C%20and%20you%20should%20go%20ask%20them%2C%E2%80%9D%20Fear%20tells%20me.">don’t expect Sony or Rockstar</a> to bring their PC games to the service.</p></div><p>Lastly, while I expect this is a symptom of the pre-launch test servers, I ran into unusual bugs testing GFN RTX 5080 and Install-to-Play. The client sometimes forgot my streaming settings; GeForce Now sometimes thought I was trying to log in from Virginia and Steam blocked that login; I had other sign-in issues and an occasional black screens, issues syncing games with Steam and Uplay, found some games wouldn’t launch right away anymore after I clicked them, and so on.</p><p>If you see those same issues, or if you find Install-to-Play brings surprising new gems, let me know!</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>We love to say that every Pokémon is probably somebody’s favorite, but the way Game Freak </span><a href="https://x.com/GatorEXP/status/1963942694859780583"><span>suddenly started going really hard on Malamar</span></a><span>, the squid-like creature whose claim to fame is its bizarre evolution requirement that makes you hold your 3DS upside down while its pre-evolution form, Inkay, levels up, had the makings of a propaganda psyop that I would not fall for. Since last week, The Pokémon Company has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1963588689684017623"><span>posting videos</span></a><span> and sending out care packages showing an uncharacteristic level of adoration for the squid. I love a good bit, and I like that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is leaning more into a memetic absurdism instead of a squeaky-clean, family-friendly image. So I had to wonder, what was this all leading to? It turns out, Malamar is one of the old Pokémon getting new love in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with a Mega Evolution.</span></p>  <p><span>The live-action trailer reveals that all this excitement is due to a Malamar, which has gone into overdrive after it mega-evolved, using its hypnosis on the citizens of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world. Once the ‘mon changes forms, it can hypnotize people to the point of completely changing their personalities. Its appearance is a bit more slender than in its base form, and its body becomes luminescent, emitting a rainbow light that seems to be the source of its hypnotic abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>It’s nice that more obscure Pokémon are getting Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Dragonite and Victreebel are cool additions, but we can always use more non-Generation I representation when giving old Pokémon new forms. I do wonder, though, if the game will find some way to implement Malamar’s signature odd evolution style into the Mega Evolution. Maybe you’ll have to hold your Switch or Switch 2 upside down to acquire its Mega Stone when the game launches on October 16.</span></p>

(69.8 kg)</li></ul><p>Malamar’s brain has become enlarged as a result of Mega Evolution. Greatly enhanced psychic power overflows from its body, emitting a bright glow. This vividly colored light further amplifies the Pokemon’s hypnotic abilities, allowing it to freely overwrite the personalities or even memories of others—a terrifying power that can make someone seem like an entirely different person.</p><p>Its glowing, undulating tendrils are able to pick up on the feelings of those around it. It prefers battling with efficiency, using its powerful intellect to analyze the situation with levelheadedness as it fights. Mega Malamar views others—even Pokemon Trainers—as its pawns.

		<p>The next Nintendo Direct has been confirmed to take place this week on Friday 12th September at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 10AM EDT / 8AM PDT).</p>



<p>The news has come exclusively through the Nintendo Today app at this moment, and there’s minimal details outside of the date and time. Typically we are given information of the length of time and some kind of indication on the scope of the Direct, whether the focus will be on a particular system, first or third parties, or indies, but the walled garden of information presented within Nintendo Today doesn’t have this.</p>
<p>More information will likely come out as the news spreads to Nintendo’s public social media and the placeholder YouTube stream page goes live.</p>
<p>Until then… we’ll probably get a release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> this time, wouldn’t you think? The game is still set for launch in 2025, and is a significant first party project for both the length of its development and the fact that it’s coming to both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>

<p>In case you happened to miss it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2, and it's really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">rather good</a>.</p>
<p>Despite leaning heavily on tried-and-tested survival horror tropes, Bloober Team's latest delivers a fascinating story involving time travel, big helmets, and gross, gooey creatures that have the ability to merge with dead bodies. Gross. If you're a genre fan or you simply enjoy well-told stories, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>To highlight its support for the Switch 2, Bloober Team has concocted an awesome new live-action trailer that showcases the game's two timelines while demonstrating multiple methods of control, including the Switch 2's mouse mode. You can watch it first right here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest new IP from Bloober, with the team recently garnering critical acclaim for its work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake on PS5. It's been confirmed that a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> is also in the works, but we sincerely hope that Bloober is keen to expand the world of Cronos in the future too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-brings-cloud-experience-closer-than-ever-to-local-%E2%80%93-but-latency-remains.1293555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On the eve of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> an imminent major upgrade to the GeForce NOW cloud gaming experience. The new server hardware (upgraded from RTX 4080-class Lovelace to RTX 5080-class Blackwell GPU and an AMD Zen 5 8-core CPU) is available starting today to Ultimate subscribers who access the RTX server SuperPODs in San Jose, Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark in the US, Frankfurt, Germany, and Paris, France. More cities will be gradually upgraded; you can follow that progress <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<p>The hardware itself provides a noticeable boost in game performance, especially for those games that support the RTX 50-exclusive DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation feature. Indeed, it is little wonder that of the 23 PC games currently enabled to leverage the more powerful GeForce NOW hardware, most already support DLSS 4 MFG:</p>



<p>● Apex Legends<br>● Assassin’s Creed Shadows<br>● Baldur’s Gate 3<br>● Black Myth: Wukong<br>● Borderlands 4<br>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br>● Counter-Strike 2<br>● Cronos: The New Dawn<br>● Cyberpunk 2077<br>● Diablo 4<br>● Doom: The Dark Ages<br>● Dune: Awakening<br>● Dying Light: The Beast<br>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br>● Grounded 2<br>● Hell Is Us<br>● Indiana Jones and the Great Circle<br>● Mafia: The Old Country<br>● Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024<br>● Overwatch 2<br>● Titan Quest II<br>● Warframe<br>● The Witcher 3</p>



<p>The performance upgrade is entirely comparable to moving from the RTX 4080 to RTX 5080 desktop GPUs. That would already be cause for celebration, especially since it's a free upgrade. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I pointed out in my Gamescom 2025 report</a>, there's much more to this GeForce NOW 'level up' than just moving to RTX Blackwell-powered server hardware.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GeForce NOW RTX 5080 4K@60 Cinematic Quality Streaming - Black Myth: Wukong Benchmark" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sec98y4q5bs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cloud streaming now supports up to 5K@120FPS, 1440P@240FPS, or 1080P@360FPS, provided you have a compatible device. Moreover, NVIDIA has introduced a new suite of features labeled Cinematic Quality Streaming (CQS), which includes, among other things, YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and improve the clarity of in-game heads-up display (HUD), and DPI awareness. The whole point of CQS is to combat the inevitable compression artifacts that come with any type of streaming. At Gamescom, NVIDIA demonstrated that this is particularly useful in highly detailed games like Black Myth: Wukong to better surface details like vegetation and hair that suffer more than others from compression issues.</p>



<p>Now that I've had the chance to test the GeForce NOW upgrade at home, I realized that CQS does have a limitation: frame rate. More specifically, the full suite of CQS algorithms is only available when selecting the Cinematic setting under Streaming Quality, and Cinematic only allows streaming up to 60 frames per second. If you want to choose Custom Mode, which enables up to 5K resolution and 120 frames per second, you must be aware that, according to NVIDIA, 'visual quality will not be prioritized and turning on all of these features may impact other aspects of streaming performance'. Custom Mode does, however, let you enable 10-bit YUV 4:4:4, AI Video Filter (which can be further customized with 0-10 sliders for denoising and sharpening), and the HUD sharpness filter.</p>

</figure>



<p>This was a slight disappointment, as it seems like there is no current way to get the absolute best of both worlds. Having tried both, with a 120Hz (or higher) display, I would pick Custom Mode, as I did not notice a significant difference in clarity and sharpness between the two. However, the captured footage was based on the Cinematic setting, mostly because YouTube is limited to 4K@60FPS anyway.</p>



<p>For the test, I used my LG G5 55" OLED TV, the same one I use regularly for my gaming PC, which is equipped with NVIDIA's flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Being used to local gaming on the display, I can still spot some visual differences (mainly, a softer image, even with the new sharpness filters) when playing on the cloud, but there is little doubt that they have gotten a lot smaller. The visuals enabled with CQS and the RTX Blackwell upgrade are top-notch and easily surpass anything in gaming, save for the high-end local PC experience, and that is compared against very pricey hardware. On this account, GeForce NOW is absolutely the more convenient choice.</p>

<p>However, even with the improvements made to latency (such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a>-powered hardware packet pacing), I could definitely feel the difference in control responsiveness: playing the same game on the cloud is just laggy enough to notice when moving the character. Now, of course, as with all network-related things, your mileage may vary there. That said, the thing is, while I am not in an ideal situation (the closest server, Frankfurt, is some 1250km, or 776 miles, away from my place), for most users, it is unlikely to get any better. As you can see, the handy post-session GeForce NOW report shows excellent network scores, with a ping that stayed between 22 and 29ms during the whole testing. I was, of course, using an Ethernet connection and wired controls; wireless connection and controllers would likely increase the lag feeling even further.</p>

<p>Even testing the 1080P@360FPS streaming in Overwatch 2 did not really make it feel like playing locally, I'm afraid, with the added downside that playing a competitive game is much more punishing, whereas you can easily adjust to the slightly laggy movement when you are playing a single player or even a coop game. Personally, I would never play a competitive game this way, but that is perhaps also because I would never be able to entirely shake off the thought that I might just have finished off that enemy if only I were playing locally.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There is one little caveat: L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). The IETF network protocol is now enabled by default in the GeForce NOW streaming settings, but it won't actually do anything if your ISP <strong>and</strong> the router you are using do not support L4S. The technology can potentially improve network latency, so it could be a way to reduce the aforementioned slight perception of lag. Still, I could not really test it as neither my ISP nor my router support it. For now, only Comcast and T-Mobile have introduced it to their networks and users, so it's a long way from being widely adopted.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future. </p>



<p>Because of this, cloud gaming still seems a better fit for relatively casual players who won't notice or suffer from the latency too much. Most gamers would fall into that category, though, which makes it not that big of a problem for NVIDIA. Furthermore, there are two additional aspects to consider: noise and energy. GeForce NOW has the advantage over local gaming on both sides, providing a silent and much more economically savvy experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a good year for sidescrolling action games. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review-cutting-edge" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></a> was wonderful surprise from SEGA, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a> could be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/pax-west-2025-x-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist" rel="nofollow">first of two great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games this year</a>. I'm sure I don't even need to mention <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> either.</p>

<p>At PAX West, I found what could be the next sidescrolling metroidvania to keep the party going early next year, and that's <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by a small but mighty team in the Philippines, this game has a nice pace of combat, a charming art style, and a solid foundation for what could be a fun adventure.</p>



<h2>Classic High-Speed Action</h2>

<p>Honestly, my first note I wrote in my notepad for this game was, "That's that good shit." The combat is silky smooth here, reminiscent of games like <i>Dead Cells</i>&nbsp;and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>.</p>

<p>From the jump in the demo, I had access to a robust move set that kept me mobile and engaged. Thre's a double jump, dash, air dash, and a backwards dodge just like Alucard's. There's a basic multi-hit combo attack that you can dodge out of almost whenever you'd like.</p>



<p>The biggest rule-of-cool move here is this warping spear that I unlocked partway through the demo. When it connects with an enemy, you appear slightly above and behind them, ready to rain down a quick combo. Equal parts mobility and offense, it was something I spammed whenever I had the chance.</p>

<p>It opened up a fun way of thinking as well, where I'd sometimes leave enemies alive but with low health. If I was in a corner, one well-aimed spear zipped me away to relative safety.</p>



<p>In general, I found myself always wanting to be on the move because it just felt good to move. And you'll want to stay mobile, with the number of enemies and attacks that the <em>Fallen Tear</em> throws at you.</p>

<p>I thought the healing mechanic was nifty, too, as it rewards aggression. Pressing down on the D-pad spends some meter to heal, though it's pretty minimal. Some enemies drop red orbs when they die, and as long as they're on screen, Hira, the protagonist, will suck them in to heal more substantially.</p>



<h2>The Power of Friendship</h2>

<p>Fallen Tear: The Ascension also borrows some inspiration from JRPGs, featuring a party of people you can recruit and swap in and out. You meet them along your journey, but they won't necessarily be out and about, wreaking havoc by your side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, you sort of "equip" them. You can have up to three at a time, and each one will provide a passive buff. Additionally, they'll each have an active ability that's mapped to when you hold a shoulder button and press a face button.</p>



<p>When three are equipped, you can build up a meter and expend it to do a big group attack using your entire party, which is a great way to unload big damage on a boss.</p>

<p>These characters are more than just combat buffs, though. According to the Steam page for <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>, you can bond with these party members throughout the story, which is giving <em>Persona </em>social links to me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's supposed to be a larger focus on these bonds in relation to the story, per its inspiration from JRPGs. I'm all for the power of friendship being a core part of the story, and I hope to see more of it as it comes out next year.</p>



<h2><em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With its charming, hand-drawn art style, <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> is a treat to look at, especially in motion. When it pulls you in, it keeps you there with its engaging combat and fluid movement. I can only hope that feeling stays for the long-term as the story unfolds in the full game.</p>

              <p>As has been much rumored over the last couple of weeks, an hour-long Nintendo Direct has now been officially confirmed for September 12. That’s Friday of this week, if you’ve lost track of your calendar. It’s timed to fall the day before Mario’s 40th birthday (well, the 40th birthday of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>at least, Mario himself did exist prior to that), so it seems likely that’ll be at least part of the focus. Of course, there’s also a lot of expectation around <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p> <p>It’s obviously a very big deal for Nintendo that the franchise that turned Mario into a superstar and that coincided with the company invading Americans’ homes with the NES is turning the big four-zero, so it’s enormously unfortunate that this should have fallen on a Saturday. Presumably the console company has at least <em>something</em> cute to announce for the occasion, even if it’s not the next big&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em> game we’re all hoping for, but it would get lost if announced over the weekend. The next choice would then be Thursday, Nintendo’s preferred day for Directs, and close enough that it could still create enough buzz for the big day. It’s just, this Thursday is September 11, and pretty much everyone knows it’s a disastrous day to announce anything as people will find some sort of negative association with the events from 24 years ago. So that pretty much left the company with Friday.</p> <p>As for what will be revealed, we have very little idea. Obviously what everyone wants to hear is news on a follow-up to Switch launch game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, but given the team behind it was responsible for the just-released&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, that doesn’t seem enormously likely. Possible, though! Nintendo is notoriously secretive, and if the team was split into two, or a whole new group were given responsibility for the aging plumber, there might be something to reveal for this holiday season? I’m just wildly hoping at this point.</p>

 <p>Of course, Nintendo has approximately 32 million different&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> franchises, and it would be ridiculous if there weren’t something to reveal for at least one of them. Hopefully not yet another remastering, but maybe a new 2D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> platformer? Maybe a new&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario</em>? That’d be sweet.</p> <p>The other big game about which we’ve heard almost nothing is&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. We know the game is close to done, because it keeps getting rated in various countries around the world, but there’s not been an official word on a possible release date. I bet my bottom that this gets revealed on Friday, perhaps with an announcement for a forthcoming <em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>Direct, given that seems to be the current approach. If it&nbsp;<em>weren’t</em> to be mentioned in this week’s Direct, then everyone will start to get extremely squirrely.</p> <p>Given the Direct has no given theme, it’s possible that there could be all manner of holiday game announcements. Let’s hope so! In the meantime, you can camp the live stream right now. It’s all due to start 9 a.m. ET on September 12.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-major-changes-ahead-of-new-ultra-hard-end-game-mode.1293537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a while since FromSoftware made any big changes to<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> but today’s patch brings a surprising number of significant tweaks. It’s full of bug fixes, character reworks, and other changes players will want to be aware of before descending into the multiplayer roguelite’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">new Deep of Night endgame mode</a> that goes live Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Anyone who’s been paying attention to the datamined leaks around Deep of Night will know it’s a multi-level retooling of the regular game that adds <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">much more challenging enemies</a> as well as debuffs that weigh players down as they journey through Limveld. Successful runs will build players’ ranks, helping them to reach lower depths where enemy health and power keeps getting multiplied. I expect it to be like hitting a brick wall, otherwise known as playing E<em>lden Ring Nightreign</em> during that first week after it launched.</p> <p>But the patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">today’s 1.02.2 update</a> reveal important changes to the rest of the game as well.</p>

 <h2>Night Tide’s damage is going up after the second night</h2> <p>It’s become common for players to kill the second boss in each run and then run around the map taking damage from the rain to clean up a few loose ends or get that last level needed to reach 15. FromSoftware is trying to put and end to that by jacking up how much damage players take from the rain before ascending to take on the Nightlord.</p> <h2>The icon for Holy damage finally looks different from lightning</h2> <p>One of the cruelest tricks Nightreign played was making its first boss weak to holy and then making the holy symbol look indistinguishable from the lightning one. Months later, seasoned players might still confuse the symbols when rapidly scrolling through their inventories. To fix that, the symbol now has an orange hue (lightning is more green) and has more visible balls of light orbiting the blade. Hallelujah. It only took four months!</p>

 <h2>ED Libra finally got nerfed</h2> <p>The hardest boss in the game is getting dialed down a bit. I’d love to know what the clear rate was on Everdark Sovereign Libra compared to the rest. The goat summoned Condemned warriors to fight on its behalf who were copies of the players facing him. Those Condemned will now have less damage negation when being re-summoned, drop light shards that buff players more, and be less likely to dodge ranged attacks. The Guardian version will do less damage and all of them will target players differently, presumably meaning that they’ll actually attack Libra when he performs the Rioting ritual.</p> <h2>Targeting will be less finicky</h2> <p><em>Nightreign</em>‘s targeting system is terrible. It doesn’t activate unless your character is facing the target and it can get very sticky when you’re trying to quickly switch. One important fix, though, will help alleviate one source of constant lock-on pain, at least for PC players: “Fixed a bug where it was difficult to switch targets with a diagonal input.”</p>

 <h2>Lots of Relic changes</h2> <p>Here are the ones that stand out</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>Adjusted the effect “[Wylder] Standard attacks enhanced with fiery follow-ups when using Character Skill (greatsword only)” to consume stamina when performing follow-up attacks.</li> <li>Increased the attack power of the “[Wylder] Art activation spreads fire in area” burn effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “Continuous HP Recovery” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect.</li> <li>Changed the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect so that the HP increase persists until an attack is received, even after the art’s duration ends.</li> <li>Increased the amount of Runes obtained through the “Critical Hits Earn Runes” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “HP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the effect “FP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>Guardians are getting buffed</h2> <p>FromSoftware is throwing the weakest class a bone or three. Guardians will get better strength and dexterity gains as they level, better attack on Halberd guard counters, and higher range on their ultimate art’s attack. All of this should help them be much more effective in the early game while being even tankier in the final boss fights.</p> <h2>There might actually be penalties for leaving games now</h2> <p>I wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-leave-abandon-penalty-matchmaking-1851785434">all the way back in July</a> that <em>Nightreign</em>‘s penalty system for disconnecting felt fake. Players left all the time and never reported getting temporarily banned from matchmaking. Well, that’s about to change. “Disconnecting from a session due to network issues or quitting the game during a session in progress will result in penalties, which may limit multiplayer capabilities,” the new patch notes read. “Rejoining the session you left will remove the penalty imposed upon disconnection.”</p> <p>The timing couldn’t be better because I have a feeling a ton of players are about to start rage-quitting their Deep of Night runs.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has secured a new patent that could have major implications for future Pokemon-inspired games. Granted on September 2, 2025, <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/12403397?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI2ZjY5MzZiMi01M2Q1LTQ3NzUtYTgzNy02Y2NmMDkwNDM0OTAiLCJ2ZXIiOiJhMjM2NjRjYS1hNTNmLTRjOTItYjBjMy1lZWY1ZmYzMDVkOGEiLCJleHAiOjB9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the filing describes a system</a> that “covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” within a video game.</p><p>The patent application (<a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Games Fray</a>) was filed in March 2023 and was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office without any objection. It appears to be specifically focused on Pokemon-like games with its description and accompanying artwork, but there is concern that the wide-ranging text could potentially allow Nintendo to issue lawsuits against other companies and their games if they feature vaguely similar gameplay mechanics.</p><p>While Nintendo probably won't be taking companies like Atlus and Square Enix to court over established franchises with summoning mechanics like Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Final Fantasy, the existence of the patent could be discouraging to smaller studios, given the litigious nature of Nintendo.</p><p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has been in the crosshairs of Nintendo ever since its game was released in early access, as Nintendo sued the studio in Japan. In a statement, Nintendo explained that it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld infringed on multiple patent rights--specifically patents <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>.</p><p>Pocketpair recently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Pokeballs--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <p>There have been rumours circulating for a while, but now we have confirmation: Nintendo is hosting its next Nintendo Direct presentation this week.
</p>
<p>Per the platform holder, the stream will be broadcast online on Friday, <strong>12th September at 2pm BST</strong> (that's 9am ET or 6am PT, 3pm CEST if you're in Europe). </p>
<p>The show will run for 60 minutes (which is quite long for a Direct these days!) and promises to include updates and releases for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually quite peculiar timing for Nintendo: we've had a general Direct on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-july-31">31st July</a>, and then another specifically dedicated to Kirby Air Riders, too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-announced-for-19th-august">on 19th August</a>. This is quite close concentration for these events (no that I'm complaining).
</p><p>It is not year clear what the showcase will present, though it is worth noting there is a very substantial anniversary coming up as the world gets ready to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros (which takes place on Saturday). Will we see anything special to mark the occaision? Will get get a second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">year of Luigi</a>? Will Waluigi ever be let out of whatever cage he's been crammed in? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Outside of Mario, everyone is hoping for a release date of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> Beyond - after all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-officially-esrb-rated-sparking-hope-for-release-date-news">the nonsense</a> we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">seen</a> about the game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-no-longer-out-now-as-london-underground-advertisement-is-updated">past few months</a>, you'd hope Nintendo is actually finally ready to pull the trigger and release the damn game.</p>
<p>We'll find out more on Friday. What are you hoping to see? </p>
<p><em>This is a news-in-brief story. This is part of </em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-is-changing-to-give-you-more-of-what-you-want"><em>our vision</em></a><em> to bring you all the big news as part of a </em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-in-video-games-10th-september-destiny-discontent-and-a-new-dead-island-teased"><em>daily live report</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dambuster-tease-dead-island-3-but-where-will-the-next-outbreak-be.1293510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dambuster Studio has teased that they’re working on Dead Island 3, a sequel to their hit series revival with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in a note that celebrates 14 years since the first Dead Island game was released by original developer Techland, the studio also noted that over 20 million people have played Dead Island 2 since its release in 2023, before closing out that “the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…”</p>



<p>It looks like Jacob is set to return for the next game, traipsing down a dusty road out of LA, and this could be giving us some clues as to where the next game will be set. The look of the road would suggest that he’s heading toward the desert inland, possibly towards Las Vegas, most likely, but could we be jet setting off to another country? The stickers on his luggage mention Banoi, the island where this series started, and LA, but there’s also stickers for Australia, Ireland and the Coliseum. Obviously these would logically be places where he’s visited in the past, but teasers don’t always have to make too much sense.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2’s success is great to see, given the difficulties that the game went through in getting made. Techland had a messy breakup with publisher Deep Silver (now Plaion) and went off to make their Dying Light series, while the Dead Island franchise stuck with the publisher. They initially partnered with Yager (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a>), but after the game’s announcement at E3 2014, development didn’t progress as planned, and the game was taken away and given to&nbsp;Nottingham-based Dambuster Studios, the team previously behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/homefront-the-revolution">Homefront: The Revolution</a>, but with a longer lineage back through to the TimeSplitters franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a solid return for the zombie smashing series, as I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/18/dead-island-2-review/">Dead Island 2 review</a>, “Dead Island 2 does a great job of reanimating this dormant zombie-battling series, with the gore-filled combat and excessive weaponry that goes well with the oversaturated LA setting. It’s an enjoyable romp, but at the same time, ironically feels like it’s playing it safe.”</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a8a22963cba0/nintendo-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well it's that time again, folks! Nintendo has announced via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> that yet <em>another</em> Direct presentation will be taking place on <strong>12th September 2025</strong> (yes, that's this Friday), hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> in August.</p>
<p>The showcase is set to kick off at <strong>2</strong><strong>pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am ET / 6am PT</strong> and will provide 60 minutes' worth of news and announcements on games heading to the Switch 2 (and possibly the Switch). You can find the exact time that things get underway in your region below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PDT / 7am MDT / 8am CDT / 9am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CEST / 4pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10pm JST / 9pm AWST / 11pm AEST</li></ul>

<p>As ever, the full presentation will be streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional variant), and we'll also be hosting a stream right here on Nintendo Life, so you can watch along with us and have a good old natter about all of the announcements.</p>

<p>As for what's in store..? Well, who knows. There are known quantities like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, the former of which arguably <em>needs</em> a release date at this point. Probably both of them, actually. But of course, there's likely to be a few brand-new surprises in store for 2026, too.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of Super Mario's 40th Anniversary. Kind of a big deal, y'know? Nintendo announced quite a few neat little things for the plumber's 35th anniversary, including the likes of the <strong>Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros.</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch. We're expecting big things for this latest milestone.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-never-played-on-nintendo-systems-growing-up-and-it-didnt-matter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-never-played-on-nintendo-systems-growing-up-%E2%80%93-and-it-didn%E2%80%99t-matter.1293501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although many believe that playing classic Nintendo games growing up is some sort of pre-requisite to make great games, that doesn't seem to always be the case, as the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 director never had the opportunity to do so.</p>



<p>As reported on <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1964264936953049333">X</a> by Stealth, Guillaume Broch, Sandfall Interactive CEO and director of one of the best games released in 2025, revealed in a fresh interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250905x">DenfamiNicoGamer</a> they never had the opportunity to play Nintendo consoles and games growing up, instead playing games like the Final Fantasy and Atelier series, Devil May Cry and a PlayStation 2 entry in SEGA's Shinobi series. Likewise, Ben Fiquet, the art and creative director of Lizardcube, the French studio behind the excellent Streets of Rage 4 and Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, never played a Nintendo console growing up.</p>



<p>While this may sound really surprising to some, especially those living in North America, where Nintendo has always enjoyed massive success, not having played Nintendo games growing up is quite common in Europe, as home computers like Commodore's Amiga systems were way more popular, as were some of SEGA's systems like its 8-bit Master System. Unlike the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Shinobi: Art of Vengeance directors, I did have the opportunity to play Nintendo systems growing up in the late 80s and first half of the 90s, but only because I had the rare opportunity of playing the Super Mario Bros. arcade version during the summer of 1989, which, in many ways, influenced me greatly, and made me beg my parents for an NES and, a few years later, an SNES, which most of my friends never owned. Still, given the quality of the games they directed, it's clear how playing classic Nintendo games like the first entries in the Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid series is not really a prerequisite to create great titles.</p>



<p>If you're a fan of JRPGs, and never had the chance to try out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, you definitely should, as the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is among the best released in the current console generation. You can learn more about what makes the game so good with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>

Unlike Prime Day in July, which barely had any laptop discounts, Amazon is really stepping up this time: They’re offering <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4024/">a huge $2,600 off this HP business laptop (Intel 13th Gen i7-1355U, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, FHD Touch Screen, 64 GB DDR4, 2 TB SSD) that’s getting perfect 5-star reviews</a>. It’s now <strong>available for $1,099 down from $3,699</strong>. Plus, you also get some handy extras included like a wireless mouse, a USB-C hub, and a 128GB flash drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4024/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Supercharged HP Laptop</h2>
<p>This HP laptop comes with the latest Intel <strong>13th</strong> <strong>Gen i7-1355U processor (reaching up to 5.0GHz) and with 10 cores and 12 threads</strong>. That simply means it can keep pace with everything you do. It’s paired with Intel Iris Xe Graphics so the visuals are sharp and silky.</p>
<p>With <strong>64GB of DDR4 RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD</strong>, you’ll never be held back by this laptop no matter how many programs you have running or how much data you’re storing.</p>
<p>What’s more, the laptop is only 3.5 pounds and 0.73 inches thick so it won’t smother your bag or take up too much space. The 15.6-inch touchscreen screen is also very comfortable and bright with full HD resolution (1920 by 1080 pixels) and 300 nits of brightness: everything will stand out and look alive.</p>



<p>When it comes to staying in touch, this laptop has it all covered: It has Wi-Fi 6, which keeps the internet fast and consistent, and Bluetooth 5.3 for rapid pairing with your wireless devices. The camera is excellent for work meetings or online lessons, thanks to HP’s True Vision HD Camera that features a Privacy Guard for keeping things safe. The audio system is optimized for crisp and well-balanced sound so calls and video are clear without the use of headphones.</p>
<p>One of the standout features is the <strong>new Copilot key that launches Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong>. You can get help summarizing reports, pulling out insights or automating tedious tasks – all at the touch of a button. Based on Windows 11 Pro, this laptop comes with enhanced security features and tools that business users will appreciate.</p>
<p>Do not delay—September’s the time when it is worth grabbing it before it goes up in price again.</p>

		<p>Developer Questline has announced that update 1.1 for its open world dark fantasy RPG Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is now available, and it brings a lot of changes to the game as well fixes. One of the new additions is New Game Plus, but there is also a big nerf of removing gain of crit chance from items due to it being too easy to reach 100% that broke the balancing in New Game Plus.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-dead-reset-switch-a-gory-sci-fi-take-on-groundhog-day.1293477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Developer Wales Interactive is back with another FMV game, this time joining forces with movie studio <a href="https://darkrifthorror.com/">Dark Rift Horror</a> to present an <strong>Alien</strong>-inspired sci-fi romp with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dead_reset">Dead Reset</a>. Much like previous titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bunker">The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_dates">Five Dates</a>, this latest effort has you make key choices at frequent intervals to influence the story and, in this case, maybe survive the horrors ahead.</p>
<p>Spoiler: You won’t survive. Y’see, as the title suggests, Dead Reset is set within a time loop, with protagonist Cole Mason reliving the same moments over and over again with each subsequent death – sort of like <strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong>, then. Taking place within a dilapidated sci-fi lab of sorts, Cole discovers that a series of experiments has led to the birth of a deadly, gruesome monster; one that emerges from the chest of a helpless victim, no less. Remind you of anything?</p>
<p>Choices made throughout the story have an effect on how the supporting characters view Cole, and these include the headstrong sidekick Fearne, the brash, trigger-happy mercenary Slade, the cold, calculating scientist Magson, and more. From a morality standpoint, it’s often obvious what kind of choice needs to be made, but Dead Reset wisely keeps you on your toes by throwing in a few surprising punishments here and there – many of which result in your bloody death.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, Dead Reset is pretty grim, with blood and guts flying all over the place. However, many of the death scenes became quite funny in a <em>“Gosh, I won’t be doing</em> that <em>again”</em> kind of way. Pacing remains fairly solid, meaning you’re not waiting around too long for the story to get going again upon each reset.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the magic of storytelling, not every loop sends you right back to the beginning, because <em>jeez</em>, that would be terrible. Instead, you hit natural checkpoints along the way which make each subsequent death feel slightly less devastating. Overall, Dead Reset tells a compelling story that kept me locked in for its duration, and there’s definitely value in tracking down each of the four endings, along with the <em>*checks PR notes*</em> 337 unique scenes available.</p>
<p>As for general production, the image quality is superb throughout. The set design is decent, though you can definitely tell that it’s low-budget at times; the valves on the doors look like they’ve been carved out of tin cans. The performances are also a little mixed, with Daniel Thrace and Lyndsey Craine doing an admirable job throughout, while Andrina Carroll often struggles to sell the motivations of antagonist Magson.</p>
<p>It's a Switch release, although those playing on Switch 2 will need to, uh… consider not for now. The game frequently freezes, sometimes indefinitely, and although Wales Interactive is fully aware of this, the team is currently unable to apply a fix thanks to the lack of dev kits. Performance on Switch 1, mind you, is mostly fine. I experienced one of the aforementioned freezes, but it wasn’t a particularly lengthy one.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dead-reset]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new Asmodee Kids brand of board games. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently renamed</a> tabletop giant's new board game line is dedicated to making shorter, more approachable games for kids. Those games include reworked versions of their most popular titles.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Kids Brand Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/09/09/asmodee-to-adapt-its-most-iconic-games-into-shorter-child-friendly-versions-with-launch-of-kids-focused-brand/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, Asmodee plans to launch three board games under the Asmodee Kids brand. As mentioned above, these games will be shorter and simpler redesigns of titles from the company's esteemed catalog.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-kids-splendor-kids-box-promo.jpg?itok=L4F-Eyyx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-kids-splendor-kids-box-promo.jpg?itok=rNLqZwx6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these games is <em>My First Unlock</em>, a simplified version of the escape room-inspired, cooperative card game, <em>Unlock!.&nbsp;</em>This version will be available sometime later this month.</p>

<p>The second title is <em>Splendor Kids</em>, a more accessible version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/splendor-game-review-splendid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Splendor</em></a>, the resource management card game, which is set to launch in October. Third is <em>Dixit Kids</em>, a streamlined version of the creative storytelling card game coming next January.</p>

<p>All games launched under Asmodee Kids are designed for a maximum of thirty minutes of play. Furthermore, according to Asmodee, these reworked games were designed in collaboration with child development specialists and have been tested in both schools and community settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asmodee CEO Thomas Koegler said the following regarding the announcement of Asmodee Kids:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Board games are more than just entertainment. And while we are keeping the fun at the core of the experience, because that’s what kids are seeking, they also get to develop focus, adaptability, and emotional skills. Asmodee Kids means that children and parents can enjoy our most iconic games together.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Releasing kid-friendly board games is not unheard of for Asmodee. They have launched similar games in their Catan and Ticket to Ride series, but those were sporadic compared to this more dedicated branded product line.</p>

<p>Curiously, at time of writing, only one of the Asmodee Kids board games are available for pre-order. Splendor Kids is available now at an MSRP of $29.99, which is ten dollars cheaper. The other games' prices haven't been listed.</p>

            <p>I bring ill tidings from the land of folks who're usually busy stressing about their heirs, sire. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s paid Coronations DLC has arrived alongside the Ascendant update, and I regret to inform you that the little expansion's immediately been put in the stocks. The rotten tomatoes doth fly towards its bonce, and the resulting juice has turned its Steam reviews a mostly negative shade of crimson.</p><!--more-->
<p>Coronations was always set to be a relatively minor stop in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3486700/Crusader_Kings_III_Chapter_IV/">Chapter 4</a> pipeline of DLC Paradox have been gradually rolling out to their regal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> thing since March this year, especially compared to larger expansions like the beefier Khans of the Steppe and All Under Heaven add-ons, which bookend it on the release timeline. Basically, it makes ascending to the throne more of a big deal than it has been in the past, with a proper party and an oath you take to set a goal to accomplish during your rule.

<p>Given that Paradox were set to charge for those pretty minimal, if important, additions, at least one Reddit seer was predicting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1n7tgmk/so_we_all_know_this_is_going_to_get_eviscerated/">a week ago</a> that Coronations might well end up struggling to impress the virtual regents of Steam. It's currently sitting at a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/#app_reviews_hash">mostly negative verdict</a> from 188 reviews on there, with complaints also having leaked into the top posts of the Redditosphere, so that random citizen's crystal ball wasn't playing up. To be fair, predicting a Paradox DLC might be controversial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">doesn't exactly make you Nostradamus at this point</a>.</p><p>A lot of the objections in these reviews are simply folks arguing that Paradox should have made this update a free one, either because they view it as not offering enough depth to justify the £4.29/$4.99/€4.99 price tag, or because coronation mechanics like these are significant enough they should be rolled into the base game. Much like with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-making-adjustments-to-bloodlines-2s-day-one-vampire-clan-dlc-plans-following-backlash">paid DLC clans</a>, the publishers are being accused of nickel and diming players with their add-ons. On one hand, Paradox have clearly stated what you'll be getting if you opt to buy the Coronations pack, so you can't really accuse them of being deceptive. The argument's whether this is greedy monetisation, and I'd say it certainly lands on the grubby or unneccesary end of the scale.</p>
<p>The less subjective aspect of the negative reception comes in the form of widespread complaints about those new oaths breaking in scenarios when they shouldn't. I've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nctnfb/my_coronation_oath_to_ensure_peace_failed_even/">not managed to ensure peace</a> even though I'm not at war. I completed my oath years ago, but have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/">subsequently been told I've broken it</a>, and been served the substantial penalties to match. A number of players also reckon the timeframes given are too short, with 20 years to complete three legendary hunts being the main culprit.</p>
<p>That said, some of the examples I've read through feel like they can probably be attributed to the normal bad luck or quirkiness you might get when Crusader Kinging. Oh no, I've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1ncy1hw/another_wonderful_oversight_from_the_new_dlc_oaths/">broken my oath of preparing a good heir</a> because my son died and my grandson's a bit crap. That's a bit more c'est la medieval monarch vie to me.</p>
<p>This being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, there's already a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3565532638">mod to disable the broken oath event</a> if you wish. Coronations has also left a plenty of folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd0geg/all_under_heaven_and_ck3s_future/">concerned about the game's future</a>. Specifically Paradox's ability to deliver something good with the much-anticipated All Under Heaven DLC, which is set to expand the map into Asia, letting you lord over the likes of China and Japan. We'll have to see if the publisher can wrest back the non-reviled DLC crown.</p>
