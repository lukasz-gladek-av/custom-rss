		<p>I’ve been ill. Wallowing in a horrible flu-ridden morass, and sleeping a hell of a lot. I have had some companions through this Lemsip-flavoured fog, though, and I’ve especially loved my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-review/">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. This is a football game that doesn’t feel like a football game, and it’s just a cracking JRPG that happens to feature kicking a ball. Besides that, I’ve been playing the demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and that’s just lovely, while I’ve been balancing things out with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontier of Pandora’s</a> bombastic newest expansion, From The Ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> was first up this week, and he’s played Ghost of Yotei, Borderlands 4, and also delved into Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, though he worries, “I’m trapped beneath countless open-world games!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been revisiting a couple of his favourites after wrapping up his playthrough Mafia: The Old Country (which was also a great game). He says, “For the first time in many months, I stepped back into the sandbox realm of Calradia for Mount &amp; Blade 2’s War Sails expansion. As the name implies, this DLC is all about naval gameplay, having also introduced a Viking-influenced faction. I’m learning the ropes of how to run my own ship while making lucrative trade runs between cities, hoping to save enough to buy a big ‘ol warship.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I’ve also been playing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide after picking up the post-launch character DLCs. The nimble, punk-styled Hive Scum is fun to play as though I’ve decided to main the Arbites class, channelling my inner Judge Dredd as I dole out justice beneath the Undercity.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit of Star Wars Outlaws, but most of his time has been split between Big Hops and MIO: Memories In Orbit for review.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> “thinks” he finished Hades 2 this week. That’s not due to some Roguelike dementia, but rather the difficulty level, saying, “There’s a few challenges remaining but they are well beyond my abilities. All in all, what an incredible game!” He also played ‘real-life’ games, telling us, “My son and I had an epic battle of Warhammer 40k down our local games shop. His Tyranids versus my Battle Sisters, pretty much everyone died after an epic battle, with us drawing on victory points. It was great fun and we’re booked in again for a rematch next week!”</p>

<p>And finally for this week, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun with skirting board in his free time, so hasn’t really carried on from his holiday Switch 2 gaming. And the thing that he has played? He can’t tell you about it until Monday.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you played any New Year games?</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1401481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Note. At the time of publication, the Switch 2 update is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">not yet live</a> on European eShops. However, it is accessible from the North American eShop if you have a Nintendo Account from that territory.</em></p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:195779 @ 1767965056 -->
<hr>
<p>I’ve spent close to 300 hours with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> since it landed on Switch in 2018. That feels like rookie numbers compared to other people, but even with the portability, the Switch version has always been <em>slightly</em> behind other versions in the multiplayer department, which is where ConcernedApe’s surprise Christmas treat comes in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> on Switch 2 is almost the best way to play the game (without mods) – just a few bugs, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">which the developer is currently working on</a>, hold it back from perfection.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the Iridium-quality stuff: Mouse Mode. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-oh-no-im-not-a-fan-of-switch-2s-mouse-mode-at-all">I don’t really like Mouse Mode</a>, but here, it's perfect for two aspects of Stardew Valley that were always a bit finicky with a controller: decorating and inventory management.</p>
<p>The former is now effortless, as with the click of a button and drag of the Joy-Con 2, you can move or pop down furniture without relying on your character’s positioning. I no longer need to block out multiple days of in-game time to decorate my house. The latter also eliminates the need to use the shoulder buttons to shuffle through pages, making my speedy Skull Cavern dives a breeze.</p>
<p>I thought Mouse Mode would be good for farming, but this still only works if you’re right next to whatever you need to till or hoe. Not a big deal, but the other two uses make it a vast improvement over solely relying on the controller, which makes tabletop play a dream.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer now supports up to eight players; this was bugged on launch day, but quickly fixed. Five of us got together on a brand new co-op farm and, after a few days of running around, fighting over where to plant seeds, buying and selling random junk, fishing, and ganging up on the same trees to chop them down, it was pretty flawless, save a few little pauses and stutters when others moved between areas.</p>
<p>Improved split-screen co-op is another huge boon, as you can now play with up to three other people on the same farm on the same screen. The magic of better processing power! Or you can GameShare with up to three others to Switch 2 <em>or</em> Switch 1 – this works perfectly in handheld mode, but docked, the bottom half of the screen gets distorted.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2006086790311272546">crafting bug</a> at the time of writing which causes some items to disappear; most of the recipes affected are pretty easy to avoid for me, but it’s something to be aware of.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is Stardew Valley as you know it. Between three different farms and playing on friends' and families’ save files, I can safely say that this is one of my favourite games ever, and the best farming sim of all time. And once it's fully up-to-date, Switch 2 might rival PC as the best place to play it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2025 was an incredible year for indie games, with a huge variety of genres getting a lot of love with some truly unique and refreshing game design. Indie games continue to be where the experimental is lauded, which leads to some amazing experiences.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Indie Game of the Year Award for outstanding creative and technical design from outside a large studio.</p><ul><li>Abiotic Factor</li><li>Ball x Pit</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Megabonk</li><li>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</li><li>The Roottrees are Dead</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h2><p>Developer: The Game Kitchen | Release Date: July 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>It’s been a hot minute since we’ve seen <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in 2D (it’s been, well, decades) so it was about time we saw this coveted series go back to its roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p><p>With <em>Blasphemous</em> developer The Game Kitchen at the helm of this project, we’re met with a hard-as-nails, fast-paced 2D platformer that feels like a faithful homage to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> of yesteryear.</p><p>Ryu Hayabusa takes the bench as two new characters get some time to shine: &nbsp;. These two become fused together and have a wide range of exciting powers at their disposal. The player feels like the ultimate badass, slashing through demon enemies like butter and avoiding obstacles with the finesse only a shinobi can accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, the two ninja’s personal dynamic holds a lot of promise too, so here’s hoping The Game Kitchen brings us a sequel!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is an experience that can easily be overshadowed by the fervent attitude of its fans. There was an almost zealous anticipation for Team Cherry's follow-up to the critically acclaimed <em>Hollow Knight</em>. That anticipation continued to grow in excitement as the developers went radio silent over years of development.</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> releasing this year wasn't just a release, it was an event. An event so momentous it crashed all major digital game storefronts; a feat no other release this year pulled off.</p><p>As for the game itself, it is a remarkable achievement of an action-platformer. It builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, pushes the limits of exploration and difficulty, interweaving it with a narrative about the dangers of organized religion.</p><p>For that achievement, Team Cherry's sophomore effort deserves its praise.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-pit.jpg?itok=apk2MpdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Ball x Pit</h2><p>Developer: Kenny Sun | Release Date: October 15th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Every now and then, an indie game comes around and mashes a couple well-known genres together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. That's exactly what<em> Ball x Pit</em> does. It takes the tried-and-true formula of <em>Arkanoid </em>and twists it into a roguelike, with a dollop of city building and pinball to round it all out.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> has that classic "just one more run" hook to it, especially since each run only lasts a couple minutes. Punctuating each run is a little bit of base building, which slowly snowballs into arguably the more important part of the game.</p><p>The <em>Arkanoid</em>-style gameplay starts out pretty fun, and it only evolves into something more clever as you unlock more characters, items, and abilities. You'll find different strategies based on specific builds, and the endless combinations and low-stakes gameplay makes it so easy to lose hours to what was supposed to be one or two runs.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game.jpg?itok=Ge49aJ24 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Dispatch</h2><p>Developer: AdHoc Studio | Release Date: October 22nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>When<em> Dispatch</em>’s main character, Robert Robertson gets defeated by a villain, leaving his mechanical suit in shambles, he’s out of a job and rent is due. He still wants to make a difference with his strong sense of justice, and as fate would have it, he’s given an offer he can’t refuse: dispatch heroes for Torrance, California’s Superhero Dispatch Network, and they’ll help him get back on his feet and repair his suit.</p><p>While at first glance <em>Dispatch </em>plays like any other “choose your own adventure” type of deal, where your choices have impacts on the outcome of the story, this game innovates by fusing a strong narrative with the interactable dispatching mini-game.</p><p>With <em>Dispatch</em>’s lovable cast of villain-turned-heroes, Robert will send them from job-to-job in order to fight crime. Take into consideration if a hero is suited for the job, or else you might experience failure; though, failure isn’t always a bad thing as the writing leads to some pretty funny outcomes. In between your dispatching job, the narrative that gradually amps up over eight strong episodes is sure to capture your heart as much as it did for us at TechRaptor.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-prince.jpg?itok=LVDD9XeP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>In a world of AAA titles and never-ending sequels and remakes, it's always incredible when such a unique indie experience comes along. <em>Blue Prince</em> is an outstanding game with a simple idea that gets iterated upon, and iterated again, and used in ways that will break your brain to try to interpret.</p><p>Tonda Ros' story of creating <em>Blue Prince</em> is one that perfectly embodies the spirit of Indie game development. After enjoying games and seeing documentaries like <em>Indie Game The Movie</em> came the realization 'Yeah, I can probably do that'.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight years later, <em>Blue Prince</em> released as a game that you can "complete" in what you can consider a normal amount of time, rewarding players' interest and lateral thinking. Though, for those who are as interested in puzzle solving as Ros is for putting puzzles together, you'll get rewarded time and time again as you dig deeper and new discoveries teach you about an incredible larger world without leaving the grounds of the mansion.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has truly infected my mind and the mind of many other gamers wanting to scratch just that little bit deeper. It more than deserves it's place as the Indie GOTY.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> publishers Hooded Horse are imposing a strict ban on generative AI assets in their games, with company co-founder Tim Bender describing it as an “ethics issue” and “a very frustrating thing to have to worry about”. </p>
<p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways… suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku</a> in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'” I assume that's not a verbatim quote, but I'd love to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>The publishers also take a dim view of using generative AI for “placeholder” work, or indeed any ‘non-final’ aspect of game development. “We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender went on. </p>
<p>“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.” As an example of this slipping-through, see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">the accidental presence of a generated placeholder in The Alters</a>.

</p><p>Hooded Horse employ two artists for marketing, and Bender feels “it would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this.”</p><p>As with much discussion of generative AI, the difficulty of Hooded Horse’s position is pinning down what they're trying to ban. Does an artwork count as generated if somebody used the tech to make a base image of some kind, then fleshed it out and finished it off at length by hand? In general, genAI has become pervasive and hard to quantify across the divisions of game development, thanks not least to the deliberately imprecise, all-enveloping language of the companies selling it. There’s the gloomy underlying reality that a lot of genAI tools are being forced into operating systems and search engines in order to artificially boost “uptake” - it's hard <em>not</em> to use genAI, at this stage. </p>
<p>I write all this not to suggest that bans are useless, but that they need to be more detailed and specific. In general, whether they favour the tech or not, companies need to start talking in-depth about their usages of generative AI. As a small and slightly weird example from the world of education, James Allen’s Girls School in South London recently unveiled an <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/jamesallensgirlsschool/jags-ai-charter-and-curriculum">AI charter</a>, stipulating what they consider fair game both for teachers and for pupils.</p>
<p>I’d love to see similar documents from publishers, though I’m not expecting miracles in a world where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">the largest PC storefront’s approach to generative AI disclosures is practically useless</a>. But still, perhaps Larian will surprise me at their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">imminent Q&amp;A about generative AI usage in the forthcoming Divinity</a>.</p>
<p>Bender acknowledged the trickiness of policing generative AI when working with external partners, while reiterating the need for a blunt ban. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p><p>As an example of the difficulty of policing generative AI usage by third parties, consider the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">AI-generated material in trailers for Postal: Bullet Paradise</a>, which has now been cancelled - developers Goonswarm have attributed this oversight to external artists.</p>
<p>The minutiae of different genAI applications aside, the broad cultural or political case against generative AI has, IMO, remained pretty consistent (yes, this is the point in the 'news post' where I deliver the customary lecture, please skip to the comments if you are weary of such things). The biggest bots operate by parasitically appropriating and undermining the work of theoretically any and all human workers, whether or not you define this as actual theft or copyright infringement. Their actual utility beyond the grand promises is broadly unproven, and in some cases, obviously non-existent.</p>
<p>Being companies, the companies pushing them aren’t following the public interest: they are helping to drive up energy usage and emissions, and saturating daily life with “companion” technologies that may distort online discourse and in some cases, contribute to mental illness. Within the games industry, the tech is viewed by many executives and shareholders as a quick fix for unsatisfactory profit margins, and a tacit excuse for cutting staff.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make every usage of generative AI abominable – I can understand the appeal for smaller devs with minimal resources, and I am myself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">interested in art that makes genuinely imaginative and substantial use of generators of all kinds</a>, rather than just calling on them to “enhance productivity” - providing those technologies are responsibly operated.</p>
<p>But generative AI needs to be understood as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a form of class war</a> that will principally benefit the already-filthy-rich, and which is fundamentally anti-social in encouraging greater reliance on profit-driven corporate tools rather than solidarity with coworkers and peers.</p>
<p>Lecture over! For a more open-ended and nuanced discussion of generative AI in games, here's Sam Horti's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horrible-boring-and-cheap-experts-pan-new-chatbot-npcs-but-some-leave-room-for-optimism">recent excellent catch-up</a> with a brace of developers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and Thirsty Suitors writer Meghna Jayanth and Failbetter's narrative director Chris Gardiner.</p>

<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Redeeming Fireworks Playground codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Fireworks Playground in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the menu at the bottom-left corner of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll through the menu and click on ‘Code’</li>



<li>Paste or type the code into the textbox</li>



<li>Click on confirm and enjoy the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-fireworks-playground-codes">Where to get more Fireworks Playground Codes</h2>



<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

		<p>Ghost Ship Games has announced details for Deep Rock Galactic’s new season, including the name, date, key art and other content details. Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 is called Relics of Hoxxes and it will begin on January 29th for PC, with the console release coming two weeks afterwards on February 12th. While a new trailer for all the content has not been released, you can check out some new cosmetics.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/n8LG8V0hnws?si=zh8bceNSbjK8nUw5</p>


<p>In Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 Relics of Hoxxes, players will be sent to the new biome of the Ossuary Depths with the new Heavy Excavation mission giving the objective to find and dig up Resinite Mass deposits to send spaceward. It will not be smooth mining though as along with the normal Glyphids players will also need to deal with the new Ossiran enemies that have their own attacks to use.</p>
<p>The ‘Relic Raider’ DLC Pack, which is what the trailer above shows, will include the Relic Raider’ Armour Framework for all four classes, one ‘Relic Raider’ headgear for each class, the ‘Relic Raider’ Armour Paintjob for all armor sets, the ‘Relic Raider’ Weapon Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Framework, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Framework, and the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Paintjob. The pack will be released at the same time as Season 6 on January 29th.</p>

With 4K resolution at 27 inches, text and gaming graphics were both incredibly sharp and easy on the eyes.

Asus might be one of the first to use it in the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, which’ll have DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1, and a 90W USB-C port so you can dock and charge a laptop, but it didn’t share price or availability. <em>— Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p id="best-keyboard"><h2>Best keyboard</h2></p></div><p>There are always a lot of cool keyboards at CES. This year might be one of the best, if only because among all of the new, interesting models was Corsair’s $350 Galleon 100 SD that’ll be available later this month. It’s a full-size wired mechanical keyboard that just so happens to have a Stream Deck built in. Its greatest feat is that it manages to not look like a botched experiment.</p><p>While part of the Stream Deck’s appeal comes from the fact that it’s typically sold as a peripheral, set off to the side on your desk where you can easily reach it to mute your mic, launch an app, or configure your smart lights, it looks and feels right at home fused into this keyboard. This particular hardware is closest to a Stream Deck Plus, with a screen, two rotary knobs, and 12 buttons, each of which can be customized however you’d like via Elgato’s vast marketplace of app plug-ins, icons, sounds, and more.</p><p>The Galleon looks cutting-edge, although the keyboard aspect doesn’t necessarily stand out compared to many models already available. It has Corsair’s own mechanical switches, a hot-swappable PCB, up to 8,000Hz polling rate, and it can be configured in the company’s browser-based utility, negating the need for a software download. I’m actually using the Galleon to type this, and I don’t have much to complain about so far. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p><div><p id="best-tv"><h2>Best TV</h2></p></div><p>TCL made a bold move for CES 2026. Instead of focusing mainly on RGB LEDs like its competitors, it instead went all in on its new X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, which uses blue LEDs like the mini-LED TVs we’re familiar with. But there are two major improvements TCL made that set it apart, and that you won’t find on any other TV this year.</p><p>The X11L uses reformulated quantum dots that provide more color and an upgraded color filter TCL calls UltraColor Filter that delivers more accurate color. The two combine to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space. It’s an innovation that I expect will eventually filter into other, more affordable models — both from TCL and other manufacturers. In addition to the vibrant colors, the X11L is capable of reaching 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones.</p><p>The innovation doesn’t come cheap, with the smallest X11L at 75 inches going for $6,999.99, but by the end of the year, it will very possibly be almost half that price. — <em>John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-smart-home-device"><h2>Best laptop</h2></p></div><p>Asus is back for round two with its ROG Zephyrus Duo dual-screen gaming laptop, and I think this one could be a real knockout. The new Duo has two matching edge-to-edge 16-inch OLED displays, up to RTX 5090 graphics, an Intel Panther Lake processor, and a removable wireless keyboard / trackpad deck. It’s a clamshell laptop, a top-and-bottom or side-by-side multiscreen setup, and even a tented convertible all-in-one machine. Dual-screen laptops are nerdy fun, but I’ve seen firsthand how handy they are for productivity in my time testing the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Taking that power-user formula to a gaming laptop seems like a recipe for success in my book.</p><p>We sadly still don’t know the price of the new Zephyrus Duo — just that it’s due out in Q2 2026. Dual-screen laptops will always be a pricier niche, and I’m afraid it’s gonna be really up there; especially with two large OLEDs and the ongoing RAM shortage. Here’s to hoping the premium over the Zephyrus G16 it’s based on isn’t astronomical, because it looks awesome. I can’t wait to review it and see how I can simultaneously mix work and play on its lovely dual displays. <em>— Antonio G.

That would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/852880/nvidia-autonomous-driving-demo-tesla-fsd">Mercedes’ Drive Assist Pro</a>, which is a Level 2 partially autonomous driver assist feature for city driving as well as highways.</p><p>The system is powered by five radar sensors, 10 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. And all that sensor data is shoveled into a supercomputer from Nvidia that is capable of running up to 508 trillion operations a second.</p><p>I went on a test ride through San Francisco and was pretty impressed with how the system handled all the chaos of a crowded city. There were bike messengers, double-parked cars, delivery trucks, and people pushing baby strollers, and the Mercedes navigated all of it pretty effortlessly. It’s not a fully autonomous system yet, and the driver still needs to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. But you can see how those restrictions could eventually be lifted if Mercedes decides it’s safe enough to do so.</p><p>Think of it as Mercedes’ answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, but arguably a lot more robust thanks to all those extra sensors. In my opinion it beats Tesla’s camera-only approach just in terms of redundancy. Also it’s backed by Nvidia’s safety-certified silicon chips and AI software, all of which are going into a lot more cars in the years to come. — <em>Andrew J.

Mostly involving several bodily fluids and inconvenient tests. The Withings Body Scan 2, however, is a scale, and everyone knows how to use a scale.</p><p>The interesting thing: Withings is positioning this device less as a scale and more as a “longevity station.” It measures over 60 biomarkers, concentrating on cardiovascular and non-invasive metabolic health. It does the latter by measuring minuscule amounts of foot sweat. (And while technically foot sweat is a bodily fluid, I’ll take that over urine or blood.)</p><p>More so than the fancy metrics, what I like here is the concept of decentering weight from the entire purpose of a scale. It’s encouraging users to view their weight as one part of their health — not the <em>entire </em>measure. My only gripe is that the scale will cost a whopping $600, but hopefully the price for this kind of tech comes down over time. — <em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-wearable"><h2>Best wearable</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This was a ho-hum year for wearables at the show, so I was pleasantly surprised by L’Oréal’s take on an LED face mask — a product category I generally hate. It’s conceptually based on a sheet mask, meaning it’s much easier to wear than the typical, Jason Voorhees-esque LED masks you’ll find on the show floor. It’s made of a flexible, silicone-esque material, and the light sits much closer to your skin. There’s also a smaller version that fits just under the eyes. The flexible material also means that, down the line, you could see this technology applied to other body parts, such as the neck or decolletage. Plus, you only have to wear it for five to 10 minutes.</p><p>What I appreciate about this mask is that L’Oréal has disclosed it uses 630nm and 830nm wavelengths, and that it’s going through the extra hoops of 510(k) FDA clearance. No one <em>needs</em> red light therapy masks, and it’s totally fine if you don’t believe it’s a useful therapy. However, the combination of a smarter design, transparent labeling, and regulatory compliance is the type of innovation I want to see in a market that’s rampant with scammy versions of the same gadget. <em>— Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-hair-dryer-lamp"><h2>Best hair dryer/lamp</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Kevin McShane / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Do I need a giant hair dryer with LEDs?

A folding phone that folds <em>again.</em> Yes, it’s almost certainly going to be outrageously expensive. Yes, Huawei already did a trifold. And yes, it’s kind of nonsense to call it a trifold when it only folds twice. But gosh dang it, it’s so cool.</p><p>Just to recap: The TriFold is on sale currently in Korea, and Samsung plans to sell it in the US later this year at a to-be-disclosed price. It folds up like a wallet, with a 6.5-inch outer screen for when you want it to be a phone and a massive 10-inch inner screen when you need a tablet. Mostly I’m just impressed that it’s really <em>here.</em> Samsung started hinting at its existence last January at Unpacked; just under a year later, it’s a reality that I was able to touch, hold, and flex.</p><p>And it’s all the more appealing because, in true Samsung fashion, you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

So when I put a pair on my head and immediately enjoy what I hear, I take notice. From the moment I put the Fender Mix headphones on my head, I knew I had found something special.</p><p>The audio tuning sounded full without being overpowering. The ear cups were cushiony and the headphones had a strong amount of clamping force, but not so much that I got a headache, to keep them securely in place. And they felt well built and durable.</p><p>But the best part about them are the details. By removing one of the ear cups, you can access a door that opens to allow you to change the rechargeable battery if it ever fails. The battery gets you 100 hours of listening time (52 with ANC). And under the other ear cup is a USB-C dongle you can plug into your device to allow it to transmit an Auracast broadcast to the headphones. The headphones support low-latency, lossless, and high-res audio at 24-bit/96kHz. And if your battery runs out, you can connect a cable to the 3.5mm port and listen to them passively.</p><p>The short time I was able to spend with the Fender Mix headphones was one of the highlights of my CES. <em>— John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-robot"><h2>Best robot</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Andru Marino / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It was the year of the robot at CES, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/853973/hyundai-boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-factory-2028">Boston Dynamics’ Atlas</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855233/lg-cloid-robot-laundry-ces-2026-keynote">LG’s CLOiD</a> making their Las Vegas debuts alongside hundreds of humanoid bots hanging around every booth.</p><p>But while some of these robots gave (somewhat) impressive demos and hinted at a more compelling narrative as to how they could one day be useful in our homes, it’s clear that the Rosie the Robot-style home helper is still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">firmly part of science fiction</a>.</p><p>Instead, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">best robot at CES</a> was the one that simply climbed the stairs and cleaned them.</p><p>Robot vacuum maker Roborock debuted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/852121/roborock-saros-rover-stair-climbing-robot-vacuum-ces-2026">the Saros Rover</a>, the world’s first robot vacuum that can both climb stairs and clean them.

I used MinVerse briefly in a 3D software application I’ve never used before called <a href="https://hexagon.com/products/geomagic-freeform">Geomagic Freeform</a> and instantly felt comfortable using it because of how tactile the controls were. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling before as a hobby, but largely gave up on it because typical mice and tablet workflows made the process so cumbersome. 3D sculpting tools were the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to try but found way too expensive to ever consider, with ranges from $3,000 to $15,000. MinVerse is priced at $1,500, and the company intends to push for further API integration with more affordable programs like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya. While it’s still a hefty cost for a hobbyist, I’m inspired to try 3D modeling again knowing that this tool is out there. — <em>Owen Grove, video director</em></p><div><p id="best-sequel"><h2>Best sequel</h2></p></div><p>In between the flashy new TVs, a laptop with a rolling display, and a smartphone that folds in three ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850488/birdbuddy-2-mini-ces-2026">is the Birdbuddy 2</a>. It’s the successor to the smart bird feeder that Birdbuddy <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mybirdbuddy/bird-buddy-a-smart-bird-feeder">launched</a> as part of a Kickstarter campaign in 2020, and now it’s back with a new model that builds upon all the best parts of the Birdbuddy Pro.</p><p>The Birdbuddy 2 comes with a circular camera housing in the center of the feeder, encapsulating a sensor capable of recording 2K HDR video in a wider 135-degree field of view. The device can capture your feathered visitors in both landscape and portrait mode based on the orientation you choose by physically rotating the camera. It can also record in slow motion, similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23528786/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-ai-camera">Birdbuddy’s smart hummingbird feeder</a>.</p><p>The company claims that the Birdbuddy 2 is supposed to start recording as soon as birds land on the feeder. That sounds like a pretty exciting improvement on its own, as I often find myself missing a bird’s initial arrival when reviewing clips from my Birdfy smart feeder. But a better camera isn’t the only upgrade coming to the Birdbuddy 2. The feeder can hold a larger six-cup capacity of bird food and even comes with roof-mounted solar panels, so you don’t have to bring it inside to charge. It’s priced at $199 and is a great upgrade from Birdbuddy’s previous feeders. <em>— Emma Roth, news writer</em></p><div><p id="thing-i-want-to-try-the-most"><h2>Thing I want to try the most</h2></p></div><p>Clicks’ keyboard cases never really appealed to me; as much as I have wanted to mess around with Clicks’ physical keys, I didn’t want to slot my phone into an extra-long case. (My phone is long enough!) But the Clicks Power Keyboard, which puts the keyboard on a magnetic power bank so I can more easily take it on and off my phone? <em>That</em> is something I’m willing to try.</p><p>The double-duty nature of the device? Super useful. Sliding up my phone to access the keyboard? New fidget toy. The ability to use the keyboard in portrait and landscape mode? Yes please! Bluetooth connectivity, meaning I can use the keyboard even if the bank isn’t attached to my phone? That’s handy. And because it’s a power bank, I can bring it between phones as needed instead of having to buy a whole new bespoke case.</p><p>Plus, those physical keys look so dang fun. <em>— Jay Peters, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="best-in-show"><h2>Best in show</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Kevin McShane / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I never would’ve imagined a Lego brick taking home our biggest award at the Consumer Electronics Show, and I say that as a diehard Lego fan. The toymaker hasn’t come to CES for nearly a decade, and we typically give Best in Show to a stunning new screen or chip or a technology that will impact the industry for years.</p><p>But nothing has captured attention at CES quite like the Lego Smart Brick. My colleagues agree: It’s a breath of fresh air. An AI-free product at a show filled with AI cringe. An idea that seems <em>more</em> compelling when you look deeper, not less. A real product with a real price coming this March, not a concept or prototype. And it was genuinely fun to play with!</p><p>When you drop one of these Smart Bricks on a Lego creation, it becomes whatever Lego’s nearby smart NFC tags and figures tell it to become. It can be a spaceship that swoops and soars and refuels and plays a blasting minigame with other ships nearby. It can be a musical instrument that plays certain tunes, a birthday cake whose candles you blow out. It can be a car that accelerates and swerves and crashes and sounds alarms if a bad guy tries to nab it. It can be a Lego creature that purrs when you stroke its back. It can simultaneously roleplay the characters that drive the cars and ships, having them react to a kid’s actions.</p><p>Kids can mix and match and combine the smarts with normal Lego bricks, repurposing the same lights and sounds and minigames the toymaker has devised for their own creations — powering up <em>any</em> Lego spaceship they build by using the Star Wars X-wing tag, or building a helicopter that quacks like a duck.</p><p>And it sure sounds like these Smart Bricks won’t just be for kids. The company touts them as its biggest innovation since the minifigure in 1978, and rumor has it that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631679/lego-pokemon-building-sets-availability"> Lego Pokémon</a> will be the next to feature them. <em>— Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Verge Staff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858494/ces-2026-best-new-tech-tv-car-wearable]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The regular modpocalypses which tend to erupt when a fresh update for a game comes down the pipeline - an especially terrifying prospect if it's an older game and the tweaks/additions aren't something you're happy to temporarily switch back to vanilladom in order to enjoy - may now be less of a ballache. Well, at least when it comes to the Steam Workshop, which has just had new version control pipes welded to its pulsating metal frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Building on the features they already has in terms of letting developers offer older versions of games as optional branches if they wish, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497183817277113901?utm_source=SteamDB">have announced</a> the release of some new Steam APIs and Workshop item options designed to "make it easier for developers and mod authors to work together in ensuring compatibility of mods as games evolve". Basically, devs are able to "better define" previous game versions , while modders can upload different versions of their mods which are compatible with those game versions and make clear what should work with what.</p>
<p>It's a process we've seen be necessary on a larger scale with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-modders-still-have-no-plans-to-port-it-to-next-gen-fallout-4-unless-a-console-version-becomes-possible">only available in a form</a> which works with a specific pre next-gen update version of that game. In this case, it should be easier to keep the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> working with your regular load order if you've delved into the workshop and downloaded 25 million custom livery mods for your favourite MAN lorry which are suddenly out of date. Though, obviously that still depends on developers and modders having gone in and made use of these new tools for their works.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/itemversioning">full documention</a>, devs will be able use Steam's API to detect which version of the game a player's using, which mods they have installed, and put up an interface splash asking the player if they'd like to switch to the right game version if necessary. That sounds like it could make troubleshooting much more of a doddle, with an extra step even suggesting Steam can subsequently be prompted to close the game, switch branches and relaunch the game once the right version's installed. As for a more in-depth picture of what you'll see when checking out which mods work with different versions, the following passage from the guidance for modders sheds a bit more light on how they might use the tools:</p>
<blockquote>We know that many mod authors will not have the time to check whether their mod supports the latest version of a game. So we built this system to support ranges that include or exclude future updates. If the mod item is generally a simple item and likely to work with new versions of the game, then it may make sense to leave the supported range open-ended. However, if the mod is complex and the mod author wishes to test their mod with new game versions before declaring support, that can be easily done when configuring the supported ranges.</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how it plays out in practice, but anything that might help keep us all from the scourge of corrupted or unusable saves with thousands of hours put into them is welcome news.</p>

<p>The cartoon crossovers keep coming in Fortnite. The wackiness of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park world has entered the holy grounds of Fortnite, and there’s a bunch of hilarious skins to unlock and use in the shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> eventually has to run out of collaboration ideas, right? The Simpsons was a monumental achievement for Epic Games, and having Harry Potter content is always a blessing. But now South Park has entered the game, bringing skins sure to put a smile on the faces of long-time fans.</p>



<p>Epic knows how to pull off a collab, and the South Park skins prove this.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-south-park-skins-in-fortnite-crossover">How Many South Park Skins In Fortnite Crossover?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a collaboration. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five fun South Park skins to choose from in the January 2026 Fortnite crossover.</strong></p>



<p>You’ve definitely got a decision to make with the South Park skins. Each of the series’ main characters—and another fan-favorite—has been given the honor of a Fortnite skin.</p>



<p>Cartman’s is instantly recognizable, but it may come down to who’s your favorite character.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-collab">Every South Park Skin In Fortnite Collab</h2>



<p><strong>There are Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Butters Stotch South Park skins to choose from in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The four main heroes who’ve graced TV and movie screens for nearly 30 years were always going to be first in line for skins. Then you’ve got Butters, who quickly morphed into another of the main characters, and could be considered the ‘fifth’ member of the friends’ gang.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-cost-explained">How To Get Every South Park Skin In Fortnite, Cost Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cough up the V-Bucks. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are no special quests tied to skins; you simply need to pay a fixed fee of V-Bucks to acquire any of the South Park skins found in the Fortnite collab.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of each skin and the cost.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">South Park Skin Name</th><th data-align="center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eric Cartman</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kenny McCormick</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kyle Broflovski</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stan Marsh</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Butters Stotch</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each skin (if purchased separately) comes with the base skin, a couple of customizable styles, and a Back Bling item particular to the character.</p>



<p>You can also buy them as a fixed group with the ‘Gonna Have Myself A Time’ bundle, which will set you back <strong>4,000 V-Bucks</strong> at present.</p>



<p>How A.W.E.S.O.M.-O are these skins, seriously? But, with over 20 seasons’ worth of material, the time has come to let IG know which ones you’re sad didn’t make the cut, and what future South Park content the game needs. The place to do this is the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> that the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> will feature three games: <strong>Playground</strong>'s <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, and <strong>Game Freak</strong>'s new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong> intellectual property.</p>



<p>However, out of three Xbox Developer Direct presentations, on two occasions there were also secret announcements that Microsoft held off until the actual show. The very first time, in 2023, there was the reveal and shadow drop of <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>' <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was critically acclaimed</a> but still proved insufficient to prevent Microsoft from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>shutting down the studio</strong> just over a year later</a>. Thankfully, the Japanese developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was later resurrected by KRAFTON</a></strong>, which also acquired the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>



<p>Last year, the surprise came once again from Japan as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">shadowdropped</a> <strong>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</strong>, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the acclaimed action game, and also announced <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to a great reception</a> in late 2025.</p>



<p>Well, according to the trustworthy insider <strong>shinobi602</strong>, there's going to be another surprise in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. In a post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ResetEra board</a>, he wrote:</p>



<p><em>There's a 'secret' fourth game.</em></p>



<p>When asked by a fellow user if he was excited about it, he replied that he actually wasn't very excited about this game, but that was only due to his personal taste. At this point, it is really anyone's guess what it could be, so all bets are off.</p>



<p>Still, the three confirmed games should be enough to carry the show on their own. Forza Horizon 6 is the sure bet: if Playground keeps the upward trajectory of the previous few games, we're in for a treat, and the studio's claim that its open world rendition of Japan <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will 'blow fans' away</a></strong> definitely raised the excitement.</p>



<p>Fable is a bit more of a wild card. Playground has worked on this project for eight years, and we still know very little about it (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have hyped the game</a> as being reminiscent of The Witcher 3 in some ways). However, the show announcement blog mentioned we'd get the first in-depth look at new 'stunning' gameplay, reportedly portraying all of the franchise's tenets: British humour, choices and consequences, drama, and chickens.</p>



<p>Then there's the third-party game, Beast of Reincarnation. It's the first non-Pokémon project of Game Freak, and thus there's a lot of hype for it, although we don't really know much except that it chronicles the journey of one man and their dog in post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, just like the other two, is due to launch this year on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 airs on<strong> January 22</strong> at <strong>10 AM Pacific / 1 PM Eastern / 6 PM UK</strong> on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Division 3 is ‘Shaping Up to Be a Monster’, Dev Says]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/</link>
            <guid>1401424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

			<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII</em></strong> often dominates the spotlight, its 1994 predecessor, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, remains the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">holy grail</strong>" for many long-term series fans. It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Creative Vision Behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth | Naoki Hamaguchi Exclusive Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbrBjFZabUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

            <p>Cygames, the Japanese video game developer responsible for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has announced its intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/">A blog post</a> on the official website states Cygames AI Studio Inc will be developing "AI-based services and tools". A breakdown of key information at the bottom of the post also indicates it'll be involved in operation support and consulting as part of its AI services.</p>
<p>The post also features a paragraph detailing the background for this company, including the reasoning for why it's been established. The statement, translated into English using built-in Google tools, reads: "Generative AI, which has emerged in recent years, is an important technology with the potential to transform accumulated knowledge into the driving force behind the next wave of creativity.</p>

<p>"At the AI Studio, Cygames will pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. From research and development of its own models to providing services and tools for production sites, the company will build a unique creative cycle that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity</p>
<p>"Through the establishment of the AI Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being "a company that creates the best content."</p>
<p>Japanese video game companies such as Cygames appear to be largely embracing generative AI technology. In a poll during last year's Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of companies that responded stated generative AI was being used in development</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has indicated its desire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">to replace much of its QA work with generative AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega too has expressed eagerness to use the tech in spite of "strong resistance"</a>.</p>
<p>Cygames' current golden goose in Western markets, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's TGAs</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Another five games make up our most wanted list today, and these ones are the last few games before we plunge into the top 10. On this list is a longstanding rival making the jump to pastures new, a couple of sequels, and the return of a long dormant franchise.</p>
<h2>15 – Halo: Campaign Evolved</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In October, the once unthinkable finally happened. Microsoft’s flagship <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo franchise was confirmed to be coming to PlayStation for the first time</a>. What had long been a key part of Microsoft’s strategy to draw players to its hardware over PlayStation, is now going multiplatform with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a full on remake of the original Halo campaign with new gameplay tweaks and content. As the name suggests it will not feature any competitive PvP multiplayer, but Halo: Campaign Evolved will have two player local co-op and four player online co-op. It will also feature three new prequel missions, new enemies, more weapons including the Halo 2’s Battle Rifle, and more vehicles.</p>

<h2>14 – Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</h2>
<p><em>PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Nine years after the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/20/dawn-of-war-iii-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III</a>, we are expecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War IV</a> to launch this year, coming from new developer King Art Games. It will be a big game in which players can play through a campaign of over 70 missions while playing as one of four factions, those being Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Official Announce Trailer | Gamescom Opening Night 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The campaign is not the only part of the next entry to the RTS franchise, with multiplayer also being a key component of Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War IV. Those multiplayer modes will include &nbsp;1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer, with players able to create their own factions using the Painter mode or established factions in the universe. Other game modes will also be included such as Last Man Standing.</p>
<h2>13 – Saros</h2>
<p><em>PS5 – 30th April 2026</em></p>
<p>When something works why change the formula too much? That seems to be Housemarque’s thinking behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal’s</a> successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>. A time loop roguelike third person shooter where progress is made by repeating runs and pushing forward each time as you learn more about the world. While the gameplay is similar the story and characters are all new.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saros follows the story of Arjun Devraj, played by Rahul Kohli, a team leader of the Soltari Enforcers who have been sent to this planet. The planet is already hostile enough but the dying sun and time loop issue is stretching patience between the team. The story here will appear to focus on the stress of the time loop on Arjun and the rest of his team.</p>
<h2>12 – Nioh 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 6th February 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> was revealed back in June which came with a timed PS5 demo. The third entry to the series refreshes things again with a new protagonist and updated combat. The main character for Nioh 3 is Tokugawa Takechiyo, the now former Shogun who was forced from the top of the Shogunate by his brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu. Tokugawa Kunimatsu hasn’t wasted time by transforming the country into a Yokai infested hellscape either.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Nioh 3 has two major changes compared to the previous games. First is the more open world structure, referred to as Open Field by Koei Tecmo, and the second is the Ninja combat stance that can be used alongside the Samurai stance. Where Samurai is all about is about facing off against enemies using high, medium, and low stances to attack and counter, Ninja is about a more hit and run approach to strike quickly and efficiently. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be a great third entry and we don’t have long to wait for its release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Catch our hands on preview of Nioh 3 here</a>.</p>
<h2>11 – Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the release of the last mainline Onimusha game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is going to bring that long absence to an end. While games have changed in 20 years, it looks like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will retain its identity as a third person action game where you face off against demons in Japan. You will be able to cut through enemies using your sword and absorb different orbs that can replenish your health, your energy attack, and give you experience. A new black orb will provide pivotal story points.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword Preview – Slicing through this samurai revival" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto during the Edo period where peace is shattered as the demonic Genma launch an attack. The only one who can fight this infestation is Miyamoto Musashi due to being bonded to an Oni Gauntlet. If you are worried about having to catch up with Onimusha lore, don’t be. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is essentially a fresh start for the series, which ties into the story it’s shaping up to tell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Catch our hands on preview of Onimusha: Way of the Sword here</a>.</p>

<p><em>That’s it for this selection, but come back tomorrow, where we’ll be breaking into the top ten with one more five-some, before featuring our top five games individually through next week.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>James Cameron's big blue aliens are back in theatres in Avatar: Fire and Ash and Ubisoft is piggybacking on the film with some new Avatar content of their own. Not a full new game this time around, but rather a major expansion, <a href="avatar:%20Frontiers%20of%20Pandora%20-%20From%20the%20Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes</a>. This DLC offers a new campaign that introduces the violent Mangkwan tribe from Cameron's latest movie, although it isn't entirely standalone, as you still need to own the base Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game to play it. The expansion arrived shortly after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-2-update-adds-third-person-ng-dlss-4-mfg-rr-fsr4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Frontiers of Pandora update</a>, which added a number of much-requested features, including a third-person mode.</p>



<p>Has Ubisoft delivered an enticing new reason to open up this Pandora's Box again? Or is this DLC not worth getting fired up about? Scroll on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora47.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was quite a remarkable game in a lot of ways (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read my full review here</a>) offering eye-popping visuals and an impressively huge and varied world, but its combat was its unfortunate Achilles’ heel. Your Na'vi character was a frustratingly flimsy 9-foot-tall glass cannon, particularly early on in the game, and being sneaky wasn't really an alternative either as the game didn't offer the player much of a stealth tool kit and punished you severely for any minor screwup. I still enjoyed the game overall at launch, but there was no denying it had some big glowing red (or, uh, blue) weak spots.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora48.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, a hearty kudos to Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment, as they’ve done quite a good job of identifying and fixing a lot of the issues Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched with. Some of these fixes, including toning down enemy AI and adding the third-person mode, have been incorporated into Frontiers of Pandora as a whole through patches, while others, including an array of combat upgrades, are exclusive to the From the Ashes expansion.</p>



<p>From the Ashes casts players as the "Dog Tag Warrior" So'lek, the badass Na'vi who rescues your character at the beginning of Frontiers of Pandora's campaign. The narrative of From the Ashes jumps forward in time a bit, with the RDA and Mangkwan teaming to torch large portions of the Kinglor Forest. Of course, it’s up to So'lek to bring them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora52-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While From the Ashes’ plot is relatively straightforward, So'lek is definitely a more compelling and proactive hero than what we got in the core game and the Mangkwan make for memorable villains. In a fun twist, you also get to team up with your protagonist from the first game, Tamtey (aka "The Sarentu"), who shows more personality here than in their own campaign. From the Ashes delivers a good handful of memorable moments without all the padding (the confusing and laborious character progression of the core game has been significantly streamlined).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora50.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes was specifically designed to be played in third-person, and for the most part, the change of viewpoint works out well. Surprisingly, one aspect you'd <em>think</em> would greatly benefit from a third-person mode, platforming, hasn’t improved all that much. Jumping is still rather unresponsive and imprecise. That said, third-person mode makes it a lot easier and more intuitive to assess your surroundings, making it the clear choice for combat and stealth scenarios.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Sneaking up on baddies is a lot less maddening now, due to the new perspective, improved enemy marking, and added instant stealth finishers. But if you want to mix it up with the RDA head on, that's now also a viable strategy, as So'lek eats RDA troops for breakfast. You're not nearly as frail as in the base game, new slow-motion aiming lets you make killer shots in a pinch, and Warrior Senses, a super mode you can activate once you fill a meter by dealing or taking enough damage, lets you go ham on entire waves of enemies. Ah, but the RDA have new tricks too. Upgraded armored enemy types and pesky robot dogs will require you to make smart use of So'lek's powerful abilities. New boss fights, including showdowns with rival Mangkwan, offer fresh challenges that stand apart from the usual RDA troops in exo suits schtick.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora51.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>From the Ashes doesn't offer much in the way of entirely new locales, instead opting to reshape the Kinglor Forest map from the core game, adding plenty of fire and ash to previously lush locales. A lot of From the Ashes' main missions revolve around reimaging key landmarks from the core game in fun and interesting ways, with, for instance, the once-safe Hometree being taken over by a large RDA base and the serene Rookery becoming a fiery gauntlet of challenging platforming and pitched combat.</p>



<p>While a lot has been improved, I don’t want to go overboard with the praise, as this still isn’t a perfect game. As mentioned, platforming remains stiff, and I wouldn't consider From the Ashes a truly top-tier shooter or stealth experience. But make no mistake, it <em>is</em> better than it was, and Massive have done an admirable job of refreshing their world and justifying this expansion’s $25 price tag – the core campaign is a solid 10 hours long, and those looking for 100 percent completion could spend twice that long.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-tightly-restrung-bow"><strong>A Tightly Restrung Bow</strong></h2>



<p>While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes is still a bit rough around the edges in some respects, you have to give developer Massive Entertainment credit for at least trying to fix almost every complaint fans had about the original game, sometimes quite successfully. Combat in particular is much improved, making embodying a 9-foot-tall alien warrior into the empowering experience it always should have been. If you enjoyed the original Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, you'll probably love From the Ashes, but even those left cold by the core game may find this DLC sparks something in them.</p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. If you already own the core game, you can pick up the expansion for $25, while those just coming on board now can get the original game and DLC packaged together for only $40.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox exclusive role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is coming to PlayStation 5, and it'll be released on the game's first anniversary: 17th February 2026 (note: the original PC and Xbox Series S/X release happened on 18th February 2025 but it's only a day's difference).</p>
<p>The benefit of a year-long wait for Avowed on PS5 means there's been a year's worth of game improvements. Among them are expanded/reworked abilities for the Ranger and Fighter skill trees, a New Game Plus mode, a Photo Mode, and the option of playing as a species other than human. You'll be able to play as the big, scaly Amauan, the small furry Orlan, and the broad-shouldered Dwarves. I wish I'd had this choice when I played.</p>

These improvements will all be available on other existing platforms, of course, but as they say: you can only make a first impression once.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed made a very good impression on me</a>. It has a slightly dated feel to it, but look past that and there's an adventure here with playful mechanics and a delightfully earnest approach to fantasy - one packed with colour and wide-eyed wonder.</p>

            <p>Following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">parliamentary debate</a> of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government last year, a group of Green Party members have announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would "compel" its MPs to support the campaign.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you need a refresher, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing for action from governments and lawmakers against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>. The campaigners argue that publishers should be required to put in place an end of life plan for titles whoe servers are shut down, ensuring players aren't locked out of always-online titles immediately at that point, instead being able to keep playing in some form - generally offline or via fan-maintained online servers. The other side of the coin argues that this entails a not unsubstantial cost and burden to put on studios or publishers.</p>
<p>There weren't any Green Party MPs present at the Stop Killing Games petition's parliamentary debate, something that arguably isn't too surprising given the left-wing party only has four MPs at current - for context, the ruling Labour Party currently have 404 and their main opposition the Conservatives have 119. Now, party member Morton Atkins, chairperson and coordinator of the party's branch for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire has announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would push the Greens towards being vocal advocates for what Stop Killing Games propose.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m campaigning to change this. In collaboration with a dozen plus <a href="https://twitter.com/GreensOrganise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GreensOrganise</a> and Green Party of England and Wales members we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign.</p>— Mo 🏳️‍🌈💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩 (@Mo_Atkins_Green) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Atkins_Green/status/2008944073218854960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"In collaboration with a dozen plus Greens Organise and Green Party of England and Wales members, we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign," Atkins announced in a thread on the Tweeter. Revealing that he signed the Stop Killing Games petition which parliament debated, he added the following:</p>
<blockquote>The Green Party of England and Wales aims to be the party for a sustainable society and the party for gamers. If this passes it will help reduce destruction of digital art which has considerable environmental impacts during its creation, keeping that art alive through community volunteers and engagement with them via 'end of life plans' for all games, preserving our online third spaces which are crucial for tackling isolation and loneliness especially among our youth and the neurodivergent community who live parts of their social lives in these spaces.</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that the group of party members Atkins cites as supporting the proposed amendment thus far is a relatively small one and doesn't appear to include any of the party's four MPs at this point. I've reached out to the Green Party to ask whether any of those MPs plan to support the proposed amendment or wish to express views on it. Atkins suggested that the amendment will be put to a vote at <a href="https://springconf2026.greenparty.org.uk/login?backUrl=%2F">the party's 2026 Spring Conference</a>.</p>

            <p>The self-explanatory <a href="https://gabemcarvalho.itch.io/dont-stare">Don’t Stare</a> is both a gamejam creation I enjoy for itself and also, an idea I’d love to be incorporated into any number of first-person RPGs. Here is how the latter possibility might work: you are bandying insults with the Demon King ahead of the final battle. You’ve got some solid bantz going, but there’s a note of awkwardness, for the Demon King has very large, protruding ears, and you can’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Such biteable tubercles! Such luscious lobes! The more you stare, the more agitated the Demon King becomes, till at last, he flees in tears before you’ve exchanged a single blow. And that, young Chosen One, is how we first defeated evil many decades ago. I understand the Demon King has had some plastic surgery since.</p><!--more-->
<p>There could actually be a Demon King in Don’t Stare, for all I know. It’s a speed-dating sim with 67 fantastical characters. Your own character doesn’t want to be here – they’ve been signed up for the event by an interfering friend. As such, your goal isn’t to romance anybody but to scare them all away by moving your eye cursor over parts of their anatomy they’re sensitive about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s as obvious as a literal hole in somebody’s head. Sometimes it takes a bit more calculation. You’ve only got 20 seconds before the bouncer throws you out, mind, so peel those peepers.</p>
<p>NPCs in videogames seldom object to being stared at - an expression of the player’s power that could always do with more analysis, versus the more obvious intrusive agency afforded by, say, guns and traversal abilities. Think about how you keep your eyes to yourself while walking down a city street, and compare how you swing the camera about without a care while playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p>Some exceptions to the rule: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, there are creatures that respond (very unpleasantly) to being looked at. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, Norman Reedus will sock you one if you look at his crotch while visiting the "Private Room" (compare and contrast "press L1 to gawp at cleavage" in MGS3).</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that Amnesia games also constrain your gaze, because looking at awful stuff will drive your character nuts. And perhaps you could make connections with a game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3595450/Object_Impermanence/">Object Impermanence</a>, in which parts of the world are only present when you're looking at them. Any other weird eye mechanics to discuss?</p>

<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>Capcom has released a new teaser trailer for Alex, the latest addition in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There's no raw gameplay here, but if you ever wanted to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a>'s Andore (Hugo) get beaten to a pulp, this trailer has you covered. Alex fully turns heel for this one, becoming 'The Man With No Allies' as he taunts his opponent and rebukes the crowd.</p>
<p>From this short teaser, we're not overly keen on Alex's look, but it's at least much, <em>much</em> better than his appearance in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a>. Jesus, that was <a href="https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/as/common/character/bustup/l/alx.png?h=eb260947df38fcec30440acb79613441">rough</a>.</p>
<p>As for when fans will finally get to play as Alex, there's no firm release date, but the trailer ends to confirm that he'll be available in 'Early Spring'. So we're potentially looking at a release in March, perhaps.</p>
<p>Alex will join Sagat and C. Viper in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass, with Ingrid making her mainline series debut at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> for Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2, we said it's "crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped", awarding it a score of 9/10. It also featured as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">one of our personal Game of the Year choices</a> for 2025, so do check that out if you have a moment.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

		<p>With just a month before the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> release on 12th February for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared a gameplay deep dive to reveal a bunch of the details to the latest Mario sports game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – A courtside deep dive! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-jpcJnnllI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mario Tennis Fever is built, of course, around the core rules of Tennis with basic shots like Top Spin, Slice and Lobs, with slides and leaping shots to reach the ball… but this is a series that always brings something pretty extra. This time around it’s Fever Rackets, which can unleash all sorts of special shots and wild effects.</p>
<p>Having charged up your Fever gauge with a long enough rally, you can pull off a Fever Shot, with each of the game’s 30 rackets having a unique effect. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Racket – Freeze a patch of the court</li>
<li>Pokey Racket – Summon a Pokey</li>
<li>Shadow Racket – Summon a shadow double to play alongside you</li>
<li>Golden Dash Racket – Get a burst of speed to reach the ball</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky thing is that you can block a Fever Shot, so long as you reach and return the ball before it lands on your side of the court – Sneaky! The various Fever Shots that deal damage can also reduce your HP until you’re forced to take a time out. Oh, and in doubles, you can both unleash a Fever Shot at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s 38 characters in total, including all of the usuals and with a special shoutout for Baby Waluigi, Goomba and Nabbit. The full list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Pauline</li>
<li>Wario</li>
<li>Waluigi</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Luma</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Bowser Jr.</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Boo</li>
<li>Shy Guy</li>
<li>Koop Trooper</li>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Diddy Kong</li>
<li>Bow-Wow</li>
<li>Birdo</li>
<li>Koopa Paratroopa</li>
<li>Petey Piranha</li>
<li>Piranha</li>
<li>Boom Boom</li>
<li>Blooper</li>
<li>Dry Bowser</li>
<li>Bry Bones</li>
<li>Baby Mario</li>
<li>Baby Luigi</li>
<li>Baby Peach</li>
<li>Wriggler</li>
<li>Nabbit</li>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Baby Wario</li>
<li>Baby Waluigi</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has particular stats, but you can match them up with any racket.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of modes to play in, from a standard tournament (now with commentary), to the tricky&nbsp;Trial Towers and Mix It Up mode, where you’ll have to play minigame modes like Ring Shot, Forest Court Match, Pinball Match, Racket Factory Match, Wonder Court Match (with Super Mario Wonder effects).</p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a ton of multiplayer. Up to four players can play on a single system in split-screen, while there’s local wireless multiplayer, and support for GameShare (which also supports streaming to the original Nintendo Switch, even though this is a Switch 2 exclusive). Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever also has amiibo support, with various Mario amiibo changing the design of the ball used within play, but not actual gameplay effects.</p>
