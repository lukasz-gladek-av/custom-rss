The card match was streamed online and the winner would receive a very rare gold Mickey card worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The winner would also move on to the Top 4 and have a chance to make it into the first <em>Lorcana</em> world tournament, so this was a big moment and a lot of people were watching. </p><h2 id="h164964"><a id=""></a>What happened during the event</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2369924180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the third and final round of the match</a></span>, Lentini “quested” with a magic broom card, gaining a point towards victory. Then he played Goat Merlin, a card that grants you a victory point for simply playing it. And then he went to banish his broom card to his discard pile because that card has an ability that lets you destroy it when you play another character and you then draw a card. That’s when his opponent, Fusade, complained and asked for a judge to step in. </p><p>Fusade’s argument was that Lentini had missed his chance to trigger the broom’s ability when he grabbed Goat Merlin’s point and moved on. If you’ve played <em>Lorcana </em>even casually you’ll know that is, uh, bullshit. In fact, in the official rules, simultaneous triggers can be handled in any order as long as you are clear with the other player. A longtime judge and <em>Lorcana </em>expert confirmed that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Mfpt3QNIsgc?t=305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no rule was broken in a video with <em>Lorcana </em>content creator Joe “Speci” Curley</a></span>. In fact, as pointed out in that same video, Lentini did something very similar earlier in that same match which wasn’t flagged by the judge or Fusade. </p><p>That didn’t matter, hoever, because during the match the judge incorrectly sided with Fusade and made Lentini put his broom back on the board, not letting him discard it to gain a draw. This ended up costing Lentini the match and a chance to qualify for the world tournament. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyLorcana/status/1885969386676379884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fusade then made it to the final match</a></span> and lost, but still qualified for the world final. The loss also cost Lentini the gold Mickey Mouse card. </p><figure id="" data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Ravensburger / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-recommend-id="image://00dc597abb4ec73f0a6ca9baa072dc44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ifuxed/as_someone_who_just_finished_the_dlc_the_cheating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There was a lot of outrage and backlash</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/cheating-accusations-mar-the-first-disney-lorcana-challenge-in-oceania/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the decision</a></span>.

Eventually, the company behind <em>Lorcana</em>, Ravensburger, stepped in and announced that it was investigating the incident. And while the investigation’s full results won’t be made public, it appears there’s a somewhat happy ending.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1ijwufp/jesse_lentini_has_been_awarded_a_gold_mickey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a Discord message from Ravensburger</a></span>, Lentini has received a gold Mickey Mouse card.

While it has yet to be confirmed whether Fusade was actually disqualified or just dropped out himself, based on how Ravensburger provided Lentini with a gold Mickey card, I think it’s safe to assume that Fusade was removed from the event.</p><p><em>Lorcana </em>is still a relatively new trading card game compared to <em>Magic </em>and <em>Pokémon</em>, so the community is happy to see this controversial situation be resolved in a mostly satisfactory way. The hope is that this is an indicator that Ravensburger is serious about protecting the game and the quality of its future events. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are certain areas where Chinese companies currently dominate: amplifiers, affordable earbuds and in-ear monitors. So when I saw a <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum post</a> and multiple YouTubers recommended a sub $50 bluetooth headset, I posted about it online. A few people bought them and told me “man, these are pretty good,” so I bought them to mess around. The wisdom was right; they’re well-built, sound solid, and were a great deal when I bought them–before Trump announced his massive China tariffs.</p><p>I should stress for anyone reading this later that this is being written in the early parts of Donald Trump’s second term. We do not know the full impact of how his continued trade war with China is going to work practically, although one element of it<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605483/shein-temu-amazon-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-exemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was the removal of the de minimis rule for goods under $800</a> that helped the import of inexpensive Chinese goods to flourish. Previously, inexpensive goods were exempt from existing tariffs and close inspection, and the removal of this rule means that not only are consumers hit with the new tariffs, but existing ones as well.</p><p>The framing of these tariffs has overwhelmingly been to state that this is a direct attack on vendors of cheap goods like Temu and SHEIN, as well as imports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-shipping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of fentanyl</a>.The last point is a little reactionary, and I am skeptical that the changes being proposed will do much to lessen the flow of fentanyl. And while I agree SHEIN sucks a lot, so does most clothing now, the framing undersells the significance of Chinese goods, including goods that are well made.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607282/trump-china-tariffs-dhl-shipment-import-duty-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fees on importing Chinese goods</a> are probably going to go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607080/qwertykeys-halts-us-shipments-tariff-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some companies halted shipments in moments of uncertainty</a>; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607475/china-tariffs-shipping-fees-charges-delays-ups-usps-fedex-dhl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays and new charges are happening</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPS briefly halted then backtracked on accepting packages from China</a>. Even if you agree with the idea of stopping the de minimis rule or buying less frivolous stuff, <a href="https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Final-de-minimis-report-Oxford-Economics-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">none of this seems particularly well-implemented</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>The pads are fairly comfortable but I tend to sweat through anything that isn't velour. These headphones are no exception.</figcaption></figure><p>This brings us to the Ugreen Max5c headphones, which I got for about $35. You may know <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ugreen</a> because they make competitive and solidly built USB-C charging cables, power chargers and power banks. They've also been expanding into other fields like Network Attached Storage (for laymen: a big box you shove hard drives into to store stuff and run a Plex server), although I have not tested them against offerings like QNAP, Synology or Terramaster.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ugreen Max5c is not listed publicly on Ugreen’s English-facing site and is currently unavailable on Amazon, but it is available on their Aliexpress store. This is not uncommon with Chinese companies, and if you dig around the official Aliexpress store you’ll find a lot of items they don’t promote as much here, like wireless earbuds and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604094/ugreen-finder-slim-thin-wallet-card-tracker-rechargeable-apple-find-my-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple AirTag clones</a>. Ugreen also has models other than the Max5c, like the Max5 Hybrid and Studio Max 2, although I have not read any reviews of either of those.</p><p>The first thing you notice when you hold the Ugreen Max5c is that it’s shockingly well built for the money. Like a lot of Ugreen’s products, trim and finish are what I would expect from a much more expensive product, although the buttons themselves are a little clicky when they’re on your head. The cups are on the smaller side but fit comfortably on my head. The headset has both a partial lateral swivel and a hinge that allows you to fold them and put them in your bag. I dislike pleather or leather earcups personally, as I run pretty hot as a general rule. While these are no exception, I found them fairly comfortable as far as these things go. I would love the ability to swap the cups out for something aftermarket, because pads always disintegrate, but anything involving noise canceling requires a good seal, which can make that a tricky proposition.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's hard to have a problem with these headphones, but I don't like relying on an app as a general rule, and wished Ugreen had more specific EQing options.</figcaption></figure><p>The stock equalization for the Max5c is distractingly bassy, which is not uncommon when designing headphones for a mass market. Switching the tuning requires you to download a <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companion app</a> from Ugreen and switch to one of the many presets. I found that “Jazz” and “Classic” tended to tame the bass into something far more transparent and clear. The app is slightly fiddly and annoying to use, and the ability to do any of this without adding clutter to my phone would have been preferential. The ability to have a parametric or graphic EQ would also have been a nice touch, but as it stands you need to use an external app to do that, which I don’t because I am a basic iPhone user. Apps like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equalizer APO</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wavelet</a> for Android are a good way to address this. The good people at Audio Science Review, where I first heard about these headphones, actually <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ugreen-max5c-25-nc-headphone-review.58627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a good preset that should work with those apps</a>.</p><p>My ability to assess just how good these headphones are is limited by several factors. The first is that I was not able to test the headphone with the advertised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAC_(codec)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LDAC codec</a> because this is one noteworthy area where Apple refuses to treat people like adults. Though it is possible to use LDAC on a Windows PC with annoying workarounds, the ability to turn the LDAC feature on in the headset requires you to enable it in the <em>Android version </em>of the app. It’s understandable that Ugreen does not want to implement a codec you can’t use with an iPhone on the iPhone app, but this and the lack of tuning made it difficult for me to give a full assessment on mobile. The other issue is that I don’t have a measurement rig like a B&amp;K 5128 – a big fake head that not only measures how headphones sound but how they behave on the head. Maybe one day if Aftermath gets serious money I’ll be able to get one of those, but for now I’m going on the measurements of others and how they sound to my own ears.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The buttons are fine, the mic is nothing to write home about although I don't expect much for $35 dollars. Wired connections can only be done via USB-C. </figcaption></figure><p>But to be honest, I’m not sure how rigorous I need to be given that these things sound pretty fantastic for about $35. For that money, what do you expect? It’s impressive that a pair of headphones has noise canceling at all at this price and even more impressive that it performs decently there. The app features four distinct levels of noise canceling, one of which is an awareness mode that worked ok, although I’ve definitely heard better. These are not perfect headphones, but they might be close to perfect $35 headphones.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="UGREEN HiTune Max5C Active Noise Cancellation Headphone Review" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48c69Pkor7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A pretty comprehensive video of the Max5C from AndyAudioVault.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Max5c features an under-explained game mode, but I assume this helps with latency. The mic quality is a little distant but performs OK for the money. I still dream that someday a company will start making mic quality a bullet point and implement something like the freakishly good array mic from the Valve Index. The battery life is advertised at 75 hours with ANC off and 45 hours with it on, and while I haven’t run it through a full charge yet, it seems to last a long time.</p><p>Though it has its quirks, the Ugreen Max5C is an incredible value for the money, or at least it was when I bought it. After I got the notification that it had entered the country and passed customs, USPS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606489/usps-reverses-china-hong-kong-parcel-decision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enacted and then rescinded a freeze on packages coming from China</a>, one of many moves recently that seems to have been shot off with little thought of the cascading effects on consumers and businesses in America. That same day I got multiple panicked emails from tea suppliers I’d ordered from in the past, pleading patience as everyone figures out how any of this shit is supposed to work. I can only imagine being someone whose livelihood depends on imports and feeling your stomach drop as the underpinning of your life changed and reverted back in about a day.</p><p>This specific moment is volatile, senseless and ambiguous; every function of our life can change hour-to-hour as the world slouches towards an increasingly unstable future. It makes recommending any action uncertain, even something as frivolous and silly as buying surprisingly nice budget headphones. This review might not be relevant for very long, but if tomorrow looks anything like today and next week looks anything like tomorrow, then I suppose it’s worth noting that these headphones sound solid and were an absolute steal when I got them.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> While this article was being edited,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7edy35pvo" target="_blank">Trump further delayed implementation of the de minimis rule</a>, which underscores the point about how nobody knows what’s going on.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Price, who directed the first two <em>Resistance </em>games, is leaving the studio, Sony now owns the IP and, assuming Insomniac remains busy with its endless slate of upcoming <em>Marvel </em>spin-offs, could potentially farm it out to another studio, either internally or outside of PlayStation. Price seems hopeful that, one way or another, the series might still come back someday. </p><p><em>“Resistance 3</em> was intended to end that chapter of the <em>Resistance </em>franchise with the way that we ended with [recurring protagonist Joseph] Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various story items, and we wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future whether we were to go ahead with more <em>Resistance</em> games or take another turn,” Price said this week. “When you work on a franchise for a long time, it’s nice to have a chance to move on to something else and at the same time it’s also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we’re part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property to <em>Resistance, </em>we will always have that opportunity to revisit <em>Resistance</em> and if it works out again, as a fan I’m going to be pretty excited.”<br></p><p>At this point, many fans would probably settle for a simple remaster of the existing trilogy for modern platforms. Since the games released on PS3, the only way to play them on PS5 remains through cloud streaming as part of the PlayStation Plus Premium subscription tier. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sling your mind back to last October and you might remember PUBG Studios (yes, that PUBG) unveiling a new 5v5 PvP shooter featuring 'shared real-time line of sight'. Well, it's back, it's got a proper name now, and there's a demo on the way.
</p>
<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studio-unveils-top-down-pvp-shooter-project-arc-with-real-time-shared-line-of-sight">last saw PUBG Studios' new title</a>, it was going by the name of Project ARC and being described as a "realistic and fast-paced top-down shooting experience inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds". Four months - and doubtless some arcane process involving an awful lot of Post-It notes - later, it's been renamed to PUBG: Blindspot.
</p>
<p>
What we have here is a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter where teams are either charged with hacking or defending a hidden crypt each game. The hacking team must blow up the walls surrounding the crypt to gain access and install a Decrypter device, while the defending team tries to stop them. But why, you might be asking yourself, is it called Blindspot?
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Well that, I assume, brings us back to the aforementioned shared line of sight, with enemies vanishing and reappearing across the map depending what individual teammates can see - a system intended to add a further tactical wrinkle through "immediate, non-verbal cooperation". Chuck in characters with their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets, alongside the promise of "skill-based, thrilling" gunfights, and that's all the basics covered.
</p>
<p>
PUBG: Blindspot doesn't have a release date yet, but if the brisk run-down above has left you in anyway intrigued, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446700/PUBG_BLINDSPOT_Demo/">demo will be available from 21st February</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. It'll feature 10 unique characters with their own signature weapons and special tools, three team deathmatch maps, and four demolition mission maps, giving players a "chance to experience what [the team has] been cooking up so far".
</p>
<p>
In semi-related news, PUBG creator Brendan Greene last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-announces-three-game-plan-one-of-which-has-a-demo-that-you-can-play-today">revealed an "ambitious" three-project plan</a> for his PlayerUnknown Productions studio. This included a  single-player open-world "emergent" survival game known as Prologue: Go Wayback, an "immersive" tech demo titled Preface: Undiscovered World, and the still-mysterious Project Artemis.

A PlayStation Vita entry was released in 2012 called Resistance: Burning Skies, but it was created by another developer, Nihilistic, (now known as nStigate Games).</p><p>Back in 2012, Price confirmed that Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-drops-resistance/1100-6349237/" data-ref-id="1100-6349237">wouldn't be making any more Resistance games</a>, but later said in 2013 that the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-seriously-considered-resistance-4/1100-6408517/" data-ref-id="1100-6408517">"seriously considered" a fourth entry</a>. However, Insomniac during that time chose to create the third-person co-op shooter game Fuse instead in order to avoid franchise fatigue.

<p>Insomniac Games wanted to develop Resistance 4, but PlayStation turned it down. That’s according to soon-to-be president of Insomniac Games Ted Price.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw?t=1311s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Price was asked about a favorite game of his that was pitched but never greenlit.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll share one,” Price said after a brief pause. “Resistance 4.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and, it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out. But it was the result of a lot of Insomniac  team members being passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p>



<p>Price said that they spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where the series could go in the future.</p>



<p>“Personally, I love this franchise,” he said.  “I was fortunate enough to be creative director on the first two Resistances. And I will remember many, many moments—good and bad—when it comes to development that taught us all a lot about how we can elevate ourselves under some pretty difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Resistance, which first debuted with 2006’s Resistance: Fall of Man, hasn’t seen a mainline game since 2011’s Resistance 3. Price said that there’s no answer to the question of if the studio will ever develop another Resistance game, but it’s something he hopes will happen in the future.</p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto parent company Take-Two's stock price is soaring this week following the company's recent earnings report on February 6. Why is the share value surging? It's often hard to know what makes a stock price move in the market, but there are some strong signals for what might be causing it this time.</p><p>Starting with the numbers, Take-Two's stock price is currently trading above $210 per share, which is about $35 higher than where it was when markets closed on Thursday. That's a gigantic gain for a single day, and it helped propel Take-Two's stock price to the highest value in the company's history.</p><p>Take-Two's previous high of around $210 per share came in 2021 during the pandemic, when many entertainment companies saw huge gains due to stay-at-home orders. For a historical comparison, when GTA V was released in September 2013, Take-Two stock was trading at around $17 per share. Anyone who bought back then, or earlier, and still holds Take-Two shares today is doing quite well.</p><p>On Thursday, Take-Two made a couple major announcements. First, management confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> remains <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">on track for release in Fall 2025, though management said it cannot rule out a delay later on</a>. Perhaps the more notable piece of news that may have contributed to the stock-price growth was that Take-Two significantly beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, which investors are seemingly responding positively to.</p><p>Take-Two lost 71 cents per share during the latest quarter for a total net loss of $125.2 million for the period. But <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/take-two-interactive-software-inc-q3-loss-increases-beats-estimates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">analysts expected Take-Two to lose about 90 cents per share</a>, meaning Take-Two's performance, while in the red overall for the period, was far better than what many expected. This, coupled with the announcement that GTA 6 remains on track, may help explain why Take-Two stock is exploding. As always, though, there are never any clear answers for why a stock moves in a particular direction.</p><p>Every Rockstar Games release in the past decade has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed beyond its originally announced date</a>, so some continue to believe GTA 6 might get pushed to 2026. Some are theorizing that GTA 6 was actually already delayed but only internally given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reports of missed deadlines</a>. Only time will tell if GTA 6 makes it out on time, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p><p>Reacting to the long wait for GTA 6, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs." He added: "I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep.

<p>There is going to be a major update coming to Balatro sometime in the future. What’s included in that update, however, is currently unknown, and that’s by design.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NTUwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYwMzA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJVTUxEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.vnpDPy2eO2srUo1cO71bFTutl-JvFojih-o2zs4niu4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Balatro developer LocalThunk gave a small update on the next update he’s working on. </p>







<p>The update, which he calls a “1.1” update for the game will include new Jokers along with various other features. LocalThunk didn’t want to get into exactly what those features will be because of potential constraints that would put on him such as the ability to “pivot if something new doesn’t work.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s healthier for the game that I keep my cards close to my chest, then give you the best version of whatever this new content update is,” he said.</p>



<h6 id="h-listen-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">LISTEN: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Despite not wanting to give anything away, he did reveal two changes that will come with the update. The first is a change to the “blue stake” modifier while the second is a change to the Matador Joker—Earn $8 if played hand triggers the Boss Blind ability. As far as what those changes will involve, that wasn’t said. Details on that, along with everything else players can expect, will come closer to its release.</p>



<p>The update is expected to arrive sometime this year.</p>

          <p>There are only two licensed professional sports games included in Wikipedia's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_negative_reception">List of video games notable for negative reception</a>." Do not be fooled, however: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_2K20">WWE 2K20</a></em> and <em>eFootball 2022</em> are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.</p>
<p>Not so with fans of <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a>, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">released a statement on Thursday</a> (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," <em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version.</p>

</a></h2>
<p><em>Football Manager 2025&nbsp;</em>was already delayed twice and is now quite late—as we are now midway into the European football (or what Americans call soccer) season. The game was intended to be a major overhaul.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson, head of developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last fall</a> that the 2025 version was the "first chapter in the new book of <em>Football Manager.</em>" Lots of existing modes would be tossed out, including international management and "touchline shouts," or phrases you can yell or calmly administer to your team during the matches you don't actually control. The game was moving from a proprietary engine to Unity. The team reimagined and redesigned more than 500 screens full of data. Perhaps most importantly, 2025 was the year the franchise landed the official license for the Premier League.</p>
<p>With all that, there have been a lot of scope changes. "I've de-scoped something today," Jacobson told Eurogamer in September, "that at the time of the [June] dev blog was still in scope. And we re-scoped something last week, and we up-scoped something last week—it's a very fluid process!" The reason for these changes? "It's our ambition," Jacobson said then. "I know that some people will find that difficult to believe because, 'Oh, they only work on iterations, they're making the same bloody game every year.'"</p>

This character requires a lot of patience to determine the opportune moment to score an elimination. Mastering the timing for her combos and the additional mechanics of her attacks, some of which are barely mentioned in-game, are crucial for improving your performance. </p><h2 id="h1277"><a id=""></a>Poke for damage and then pick off supports</h2><p>When it comes to damage and movement, Psylocke excels in controlled bursts. While she can be helpful fighting side-by-side with her teammates, she’s best played like an Assassin who prioritizes Strategists. You want to be as annoying as possible by diverting enemy attention and taking out their support heroes.</p><p>That doesn’t mean sneaking behind enemy lines is always the best strategy. You should mix up your approach now and then, but getting chased down by a more mobile hero sucks. A common tactic instead is to focus on flanking and attacking just off the side. Keep poking for damage and then dive in quickly to take out their Strategists or anyone with low health. Don’t forget that her primary fire (Psionic Crossbow) and Wing Shurikens have some major falloff damage, so you shouldn’t be attacking from too long of a distance.</p><h2 id="h1278"><a id=""></a>Maximize your burst damage with animation cancel combos</h2><p>Quite a few heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> can boost their damage output through animation canceling. The idea is to <strong>use melee or other abilities to interrupt the recovery animations of an attack</strong>, allowing you to quickly chain together moves for a quick burst damage combo. A common case for Psylocke is using melee or another ability right after throwing out her dual-projectile primary fire will skip the brief recovery period. Coming to grips with these is vital to utilizing her full potential.</p><p>The optimal combo starters for mid-range and close-range can be seen below. Keep in mind that they will do more damage by landing critical hits or ending with a Psi-Blade Dash, but you’ll still be putting the hurt on your opponents either way. If your targets are especially low on health, you can also animation-cancel after the first set of her primary fire projectiles for potentially quicker burst damage.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mid-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Psionic Crossbow</li><li>Close-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee &gt; Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee</li></ul><h2 id="h1279"><a id=""></a>Always have an escape plan, and at least one dash</h2><p>Smart positioning and critical hits will help you against a single enemy, but the tables can quickly turn when fighting multiple opponents or even a full-health Vanguard. Psylocke’s kit isn’t quite meant for those situations, which is why you must always have an escape route in mind.</p><p>Most players will try to save one of their Psi-Blade Dashes just in case things go south. I’ve found that using it to dash upwards to higher ground is a great way to escape from most situations. Her Psychic Stealth invisibility can also help you out here, although it will be interrupted if you use another ability while invisible. The rewinding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122">team-up ability</a></span> she gains from Magik is another great tool for retreating, but I don’t recommend activating it when surrounded due to the vulnerable state you’re in during the startup.</p><h2 id="h1280"><a id=""></a>Make use of Psylocke’s attacks’ special mechanics</h2><figure id="" data-id="0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-recommend-id="image://0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-recommend-id="image://0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aside from her Ultimate, each of Psylocke’s attacks has an additional mechanic that helps her sustainability. Only two of these are mentioned in-game, and none of them provide the associated stats either. Here are the interesting mechanics to keep note of:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Psylocke’s primary fire, Psionic Crossbow, reduces the cooldown of her abilities by 0.25 seconds for each bolt projectile that hits an enemy. She shoots out a pair of four bolts each time you cast the attack. Landing all eight bolts will shorten any cooldowns by a much-appreciated two seconds.</li><li>Bonus health will be granted for every Wing Shuriken projectile that hits an enemy. She’ll throw out five at a time, with each one granting 10 bonus health. Any enemy hit during the recall will also count for a maximum of 75 bonus health. Just remember that similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>, this extra bit of HP isn’t permanent and will start depleting after a few seconds.</li><li>Any thrown-out Wing Shurikens will be recalled after using a Psi-Blade Dash. They’ll travel to her location at the start of the dash and then return to her current location. This is kind of an awkward mechanic, but the benefit is that it’ll add to the damage from your dash.</li></ul><h2 id="h1281"><a id=""></a>Getting one or two kills with your Ultimate is ideal</h2><p>Dance of the Butterfly is a flashy AOE (area-of-effect) Ultimate that sees Psylocke slash away at enemies with 150-damage attacks. It initially sounds like the perfect team-killing Ult (Ultimate), but she can only perform up to eight attacks and the target of each is selected at random, with priority given to those who have been hit fewer times. That means your chances of getting a kill are lower with each additional target.</p><p>Instead of aiming for the entire team to earn a solo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace kill</a></span>, use it against groups of two or three. I’d only suggest the latter amount if they’re all close together and relatively squishy with health. You’re more likely to land at least one kill here along with leaving some enemies weak, but fingers crossed you can eliminate more with the ultimate. Strategists should naturally be the priority for this, while any Vanguards should be avoided unless their health is low.</p><hr><p>Psylocke is a fun character to play, as long as you don’t assume she handles like any other <em>Marvel Rivals</em> Duelist. Focus on dishing out burst damage and you’ll be the bane of the enemy team’s existence.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a VALORANT match with massive qualifying implications, Vitality star Nikita “Derke” Sirmitev busted out the silliest play in the playbook. And somehow, the gamble worked, leaving his opponents embarrassed, and insuring a spot for his own team at the first Masters event of the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-derke-does-the-unthinkable">Derke Does The Unthinkable </h2>



<p>In the upper bracket final of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-lands-sony-inzone-sponsorship-for-next-2-seasons-of-vct-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VCT EMEA Kickoff</a>, Vitality and Team Heretics went haed-to-head for one of two spots at Masters Bangkok. To beat Heretics, a two-time grand finalist at international events in 2024, Vitality would need to play with the utmost confidence. </p>



<p>Derke, the former star of Fnatic who switched to Vitality this past offseason, certainly didn’t lack confidence when he caught Heretics off guard with the fake Yoru clone. Typically, when a Yoru player uses their Fakeout ability, they send a clone forward that will hit enemies that shoot it with a blinding flash. So normally, enemy players just ignore the clone walking completely straight forward. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207_CrackyStormyCrocodilePJSalt-cXdQVUEvEo_Sf8k7_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Unfortunately for Heretics, it wasn’t Derke’s clone that walked onto the site, it was Derke pretending to be his clone. To make matters worse, Heretics’ Ričardas “Boo” Lukaševičius teleported right next to Derke before he turned, gifting him an additional kill. It’s a play that VALORANT fans have sometimes seen during streams and maybe in their own ranked games, but never on a pro stage as big as this one. The play also gifted Vitality a bonus round win, taking a third straight round to start Haven despite not completely buying. Vitality ended up winning Haven, and then owned Heretics’ own map pick of Abyss to claim the series, and the Masters spot, in dominant fashion.</p>

It was taken from <em>La Isla se las Tentaciones</em>, a show that mirrors the original 2003 <em>Temptation Island </em>premise of bringing couples to an erotic getaway where their romantic bonds and libidinal restraint are put under extreme duress as other beautiful participants attempt to seduce them.

Beta players are already grappling with its big challenge, a fearsome new foe called Arkveld, and its eliciting both excitement and dread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is the new flagship monster for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. This means the beast is the cover star for the game, and stands to play a significant role in the course of players' journeys through Wilds. As part of the new beta test, courageous hunters can try to tackle a hunt for the Chained Arkveld, with a 20-minute time limit and five "faint" limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ambitious players are discovering, this new monster packs a punch. Arkveld is a massive winged beast, with electric chains stretching out from each of its arms. It can swing them around and make the air crackle with its thunderous attacks, and it's surprisingly fast, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Experienced hunters <a href="https://x.com/KeithMontalbo/status/1887717556322279689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>are still finding themselves sent back in a cart</u></a> by its powerful moves. It's an impressive display of the new technology, as Arkveld uses its whips to move around, throw out long-reaching attacks, and generally be a menace. One attack in particular has Monster Hunter players in the beta thunderstruck, as it grabs the hunter and roars at them before slamming them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is even causing some mild unexpected havoc. I really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijrpqw/arkveld_is_having_none_of_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>enjoyed this video one player on the r/MHWilds subreddit captured</u></a>, of Arkveld interrupting their meal. The wilds are no place to go for lunch, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a visually impressive fight and an incredibly dangerous monster. While the difficulty might be worrisome for some, the Monster Hunter faithful seem spurred on by it. Taking down big, dangerous monsters is the name of the game after all, and seeing Wilds' flagship monster be so fearsome and iconic in equal measure is a reaffirming notion. Additionally, the "Chained" note — plus Arkveld's flagship status — has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfj5yn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players considering</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfh1n4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether there could be</a> an even more terrifying "Unchained" version down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</u></a> runs February 6 through 9, and then returns February 13 through 16.

<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2WxdDkxpT8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>

      A short emulator-aided demonstration of how the broken ladder glitch works (not shown: the dozens of frame-perfect inputs needed to pull it off).

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<h2>Better to be lucky than to be good</h2>
<p>While players have <a href="https://donkeykongforum.net/index.php?topic=325.0">theorized about using the broken ladder glitch to pass the kill screen for years</a>, it initially seemed like even this glitched shortcut was too slow for the short kill screen timer. Yet when Kosmic attempted the same trick using his own emulator-assisted setup recently, he says he was able to complete the level on his first try. What gives?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Kosmic was the beneficiary of some significant luck. Basically, every time Donkey Kong throws a barrel, there is a 1 in 32 chance that he will wait an extra half second or so before throwing the next barrel (this random process <a href="https://pastebin.com/WXR5iy7t">is explained in way too much detail in this Pastebin</a>). Since the game's bonus timer only ticks down when Donkey Kong actually throws a barrel, the semi-rare delay can give Mario the crucial extra frames he needs to reach the top of the kill screen using the broken ladder glitch.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, this randomized barrel-throwing delay can theoretically repeat indefinitely, provided the game's randomizer picks the same lucky 1-in-32 sequence over and over again. If Donkey Kong decides to delay his barrel throw about 19 times in a row, Mario would actually be able to complete the kill screen normally, without the broken ladder glitch (and without facing many barrels, even). Of course, the chances of that happening on unmodified arcade hardware are nearly 1 in 40 octillion (1 in 32^19, to be precise), so don't count on encountering it in the wild any time soon.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2075116"><p>
              Mario dies on level 22-6, which Kosmic now considers the "true" <em>Donkey Kong</em> kill screen.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>With the ladder glitch, though, Kosmic's emulator-assisted run needed significantly less luck to pass the kill screen at 22-1. He was even able to push the game past the next four stages (including previously unseen spring and pie factory screens) to reach level 22-6.</p>
<p>Kosmic calls that stage the game's true kill screen, as there's currently no known way for Mario to remove all eight rivets quickly enough to overcome the glitch-shortened timer, even with emulator assistance. Then again, for decades, players assumed there was no way to complete level 22-1, either. Maybe someone will figure out a clever method for beating this new kill screen with 40 more years of sustained effort.</p>

And while a fresh expansion isn't on the immediate horizon, there is new content coming to the game in late March with the arrival of Patch 7.2, Seekers of Eternity.</p><p>Producer and Director Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida laid out the upcoming additions during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2374740443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a livestream in Japan</a>, but Square Enix has <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XIV-ONLINE-PATCH-72-SEEKERS-OF-ETERNITY-REVEALED-DURING-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">helpfully shared the highlights</a>. There will be additional main scenario quests, as well as a new dungeon called The Underkeep, a fresh raid called The Arcadion: Cruiserweight Tier, a new trail called Recollection--which can be played on normal or extreme--and Hells' Kier, an Unreal Trial that will pit players against one of the Four Lords: Suzaku.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4440561-finalfantasyxivseekersofeternityposter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440561" data-ratio="1.4430769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4440561-finalfantasyxivseekersofeternityposter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440561"></a><figcaption>Promotional art for Final Fantasy XIV: Seekers of Eternity.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4440561-finalfantasyxivseekersofeternityposter.jpg"></figure><p>From there, players can blast out into space in Cosmic Exploration as they discover uncharted stars to find new resources for crafting. Players also have the option of exploring a mysterious island called Occult Crescent, which is inhabited by residents who will do almost anything to protect its secrets.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/as-the-final-fantasy-14-devs-continue-to-take-a-firm-stance-against-mods-that-can-enable-harassment-yoshi-p-says-improvements-are-starting-in-patch-7-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Patch 7.2 is also taking measures against a mod that can collect players' account ID information. Players in the game reportedly feared that the mod could allow stalkers in the game to harass them even when using alternate characters.</p><p>In 2024, Yoshida apologized to players for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoshi-p-apologizes-for-the-bugs-plaguing-final-fantasy-14s-new-dawntrail-expansion/1100-6524633/" data-ref-id="1100-6524633">the initial bugs in Dawntrail</a>, and noted that Final Fantasy XIV's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-will-bring-more-games-to-xbox-after-final-fantasy-14s-success/1100-6526160/" data-ref-id="1100-6526160">successful launch on Xbox Series X|S</a> would lead to more games coming to those consoles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-free-to-play-will-kick-off-with-a-realm-reborn/1100-6527979/" data-ref-id="1100-6527979">Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</a> is still in development as well.</p>

            <p>
Three years after its announcement, the future of Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game is reportedly in question - with its release said to still be "years away" if it ever launches at all.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">new report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, detailing the behind-the-scenes turmoil caused by a culture of "ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time" at Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president</a> David Haddad - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision" .
</p>
<p>
Some casualties of Warner Bros.'s reported culture under Haddad are already well-documented, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. However, Bloomberg's report also highlights a number of other projects that have either failed or floundered behind closed doors.

<figcaption>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was announced in December 2021.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyA8lnp9Tzg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Monolith's Wonder Woman game, for instance, has reportedly "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year, according to "people familiar with the business". Wonder Woman is said to have already cost Warner $100m and is still "years away from release", if it manages to make it to market at all - its fate, according to Bloomberg's sources, "remains in question".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports Monolith had originally wanted to follow its acclaimed Middle-earth games with a new franchise experimenting with procedural storytelling. However, Warner Bros. execs are said to have pushed for the studio to incorporate one of the company's big IPs, and the resulting game "plodded along for more than three years" before its cancellation - at which point Monolith head Kevin Stephens and many directors departed. After that, remaining staff began working on Wonder Woman, initially attempting to incorporate a version of Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system before switching to a "more traditional action-adventure game".
</p>
<p>
As revealed last March, Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Montreal has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-studio-supporting-wonder-woman-game">drafted in to help Monolith get Wonder Woman over the finish line</a>. However, Bloomberg says the Montreal team was initially hoping to make a game based on comic book antihero John Constantine - hopes that were dashed when execs pushed the team toward a "more recognisable character" such as the Joker or Flash. The studio ultimately opted to make a Flash game, but the project was scrapped after Warner's 2023 Flash movie flopped at the box office - leading to the resignation of "most of" Montreal's leadership team. The studio is now said to be working on a pitch for a Game of Thrones title, as it continues to help out on Wonder Woman.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's sources say the major gaps in Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's portfolio left by the company's string of cancellations and commercial failures during Haddad's tenure are likely to persist "for the next year or two". There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">one potential bright spot on the horizon</a>, however, with developer Rocksteady - following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">demise of its live-service-focused Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> - now said to be "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game". The project, though, is still "years away from landing".
