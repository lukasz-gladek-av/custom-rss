            <title><![CDATA[Full Metal Schoolgirl Review]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/full-metal-schoolgirl-review.1334692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">First impressions matter, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl throws you into its third-person shooter action shortly after a blazing fast anime-inspired opening to the tune of a J-rock banger. It immediately establishes its irreverent attitude and goofy anti-capitalist satire in a futuristic world where robots are exploited and referred to as "the working dead" – and with the goal of taking down a CEO villain, I thought to myself, "Hell yeah." But about halfway through a second run of this roguelike, it dawned on me that there just wasn't much to Full Metal Schoolgirl; it’s a dull and repetitive shooter whose gameplay foundations aren't quite good enough to save it from the largely tedious, unrewarding grind up its 100-floor tower.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Full Metal Schoolgirl - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the intro sequence where you break into the evil Maternal Jobz Corporation, you choose to play as Ryoko or Akemi, two cyborg anime girls who are functionally and aesthetically human – the one you pick winds up being the lead character and the other gets captured and plays into the story as you progress. They're seeking revenge on the company and its CEO for working their dad to death, and the story's initial disdain for corporate bullshit is sharp in a way that reminded me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>. However, that's as far as it goes before things devolve into annoying quips and no real intrigue to motivate each run; like most parts of Full Metal Schoolgirl, it doesn't build on its good ideas and its shallow execution on them wears thin rather quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a high tolerance for anime tropes, and here, it teeters between charming and eyerolling, and more frequently leans toward the latter. It's not just for its crass innuendos, but also in its incessant yapping that doesn't exude any memorable personality into its interesting premise. I'm not here to handwave the attention drawn to upskirts or the creepy actions of the doctor who upgrades your skills, either – it's just unnecessary. The moments its tropes really do work are at the very beginning and the very end, and it's as if everything in between was overlooked in the process, which is where you'll spend most of your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each floor is made up of a series of narrow hallways filled with enemy fodder alongside environmental hazards, as well as square office building rooms that function as small combat arenas. The latter throws optional challenges at you like clearing the room within a time limit or without using heals for extra money for upgrades. But this overall formula does not fundamentally change across its 100 procedurally generated floors. The scenery may change slightly for each block of floors, yet the structure stays the same. While they may throw different enemy types at you like drones, bomb-strapped robots, turrets, and mechanized dogs, no amount of mixing and matching them can make up for mediocre implementation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to see how the procedural generation clashes with itself when certain doors lead to a completely empty room or the combat challenge prompts just don't align with the way encounters are set up. This haphazard level design feels very basic at best and frustratingly messy at worst, and it persists through the large majority of the 14 hours I put into finishing the campaign. Boss fights act as endcaps to blocks of floors, and while they're relatively refreshing after blasting through the same areas over and over again, their attack patterns are quite telegraphed and simple to overcome. Still, I'll take dodging area-of-effect explosions and dumping my ultimates (or Punishment attacks, as it's called) into a spongy boss over thoughtlessly repeating identical floors of enemies, so I do wish these kinds of battles weren't so few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating a boss grants you a key to start a subsequent run at their floor, which is a godsend to cut through the needless repetition – but, they're one-time-use. If a run goes sideways after using the key and you don't defeat the next boss 20-something floors up for the next key, get ready to start at a much lower level, buddy. While this raises the stakes, as any roguelike worth its salt should do, the disappointment of having to trudge through the most boring parts to make it back to where you left off doesn’t feel worth it. Even though it gets easier on account of upgrading your stats and abilities from the materials and money you earn from each run, ascending chunks of floors still takes a lot of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was excited that this is an anime-style shooter at least, which is something I've been seeking since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">Freedom Wars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/03/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet-review">Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet</a> (which didn't quite capitalize on the premise). More often than not, playing through Full Metal Schoolgirl felt like a chore, but I can appreciate the mindless fun its mechanics sometimes offer. With a handful of specific guns and melee weapons I vibed with, I was able to get into a groove, turn my brain off, and just mow down mobs of enemies. Although most guns are pretty counterintuitive for the way encounters are designed, a high-level electric chaingun or chunky plasma ball launcher carry the right kind of weight and feedback you want from a shooter. That said, movement itself is a little too sticky for this style of game, especially when there are annoying platforming sections. And melee attacks and jumps are a tad unresponsive, even if cutting through a crowd with a katana's dash attack or the Labrys axe's aftershocks can be satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's moments like these that started to shine though more frequently in the final chunk of floors. The rate at which genuinely challenging encounters presented themselves, and the confluence of weapons that were fun to use showed up, let Full Metal Schoolgirl finish on a higher note than the absolute slog it took to get there. It didn't exactly flip the script or break away from the conventions established at the start, but it began to make the most of its basic pieces by throwing almost everything at you at a brisk pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I progressed, I naturally figured out which types of guns worked for me – slow shotguns and rifles never made sense to use, but a strong SMG that'd overheat quickly became a favorite. Learning to manage my energy meter for big axe combos, dodging, and hoverdashing became more important in the late game. And weaving in your auto-attack drone (which you summon on a cooldown) was key to salvaging a few runs. Being smart with the scarce battery supply (which is your healing item) factored into how I approached combat as well. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Roguelike/lite Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarity of gear you're rewarded with from challenge rooms is random, which leads to moments of pointlessness where I'd clear a challenge room only to be met with common level rarity items that pale in comparison to rare and legendary gear from much earlier floors. At least this makes the modifiers meaningful as they can affect how your health, energy, movement, and damage output works, especially when the shields you equip have a sizable impact on your survivability.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all. There are decent ideas with potential that meld the shooter genre and roguelike framework well – it's unfortunate that they get squandered by foundational shortcomings. Whether it be a misunderstanding of what makes the genre work or an intentionally derivative take on roguelike games, the loop it creates is woefully repetitive with boring level design. Although I found some mindless fun since its fundamental gameplay is decent and shines a bit brighter towards the very end, it's certainly not good enough to redeem this monotonous shooter. The anime-inspired charm wears thin as its tropes quickly become annoying, even if its premise shows promise. I got into a groove in its final hour as I ascended the last floors with gear and upgrades that were fun to use, but the climb to get there wasn't exactly worth the slog.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-pro-with-anc-are-going-for-pennies-now-3x-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max-2000638986</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-pro-with-anc-are-going-for-pennies-now-3x-cheaper-than-the-airpods-max.1334653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>

                <p>For years, Netflix has told investors that it's serious about investing in the video game industry. But the streamer's ambitions may need to be re-calibrated again. Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--has been shut down.</p><p>David Rippy, the CEO and co-founder of Boss Fight, shared the news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn page</a>, and shared his gratitude for the experience:</p><p>"Thanks, everyone who reached out today," wrote Rippy. "Rough news, for sure, but I'm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I'm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries. You'll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles--they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me--we're going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there's anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise."</p><p>Last summer, Netflix co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peter indicated that the streamer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">going to "ramp up" its investment in gaming</a> in part to explore new monetization options. Earlier this month, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-new-batch-of-games-can-be-played-straight-on-your-tv-no-controller-required/1100-6535331/" data-ref-id="1100-6535331">added five new games</a>--Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers--that can be played on televisions with your phone as the controller.</p><p>Previously, Netflix had even bigger plans for a AAA multiplayer shooter from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">that game and the studio behind it were closed</a> in 2024. Netflix gaming executive Alain Tascan later told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">Bloomberg</a> why the streamer pulled the plug on that project.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" said Tascan. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p>

While that's a marked price increase from the other versions of the CRKD guitar controller, it seems like a good value given what's included, especially if you're a fan of this classic color scheme.</p><div title="CRKD Gibson Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Edition Guitar Controller Bundle Preorder Guide" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4797" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="CRKD Gibson Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Edition Guitar Controller Bundle Preorder Guide" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">CRKD Gibson Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Edition Guitar Controller Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$200 | Releases November 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This bundle has everything you need to get the full guitar controller experience, including the Gibson Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Edition Guitar Controller, two swappable mechanical necks--the Pro Neck and Solo Neck--a leather strap, and more.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2700-from-the-original-price-2000638980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2-700-from-the-original-price.1334641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell laptops typically sit in the premium tier where you’re paying extra for build quality and brand reputation. But every once in a while, the pricing gods smile upon us and something wild happens. Right now, you can grab a fully loaded <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/">Dell Inspiron with Windows 11 Pro, a massive 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM for just $959, down from its usual $3,699 price tag</a>. That’s a $2,740 discount which makes this the<strong> steepest markdown on any Windows 11 Pro laptop currently available on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The configuration here is impressive for anyone who needs serious computing power without compromise: That 64GB of RAM is overkill for casual browsing, sure, but if you’re running virtual machines, editing 4K video footage, juggling dozens of browser tabs while running Adobe Creative Suite, or compiling code, this amount of memory transforms your workflow. You can <strong>keep everything open simultaneously without that dreaded slowdown</strong> when your system starts swapping to disk. The 2TB solid-state drive gives you enough room to store your entire photo library and still have breathing room left over.</p>
<h2>Professional Power That Doesn’t Break the Budget</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 7730U processor found in this laptop is an <strong>AMD Zen 3 processor with a boost speed of 4.5 GHz</strong> if the need arises for more power. With eight cores and sixteen threads, it is a multitasking beast with enough power for content generation and even some gaming in between tasks if the need arises. The Ryzen 7 7730U is optimized for performance with power savings in mind, so if your need for it is something that doesn’t require it to be plugged in for extended periods, then it is possible to use it for an extended period without checking the percentage meter like it is a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch touchscreen display has Full HD capabilities with 1920×1080 pixels</strong>, and provides sharp text rendering and picture quality minus the power consumption associated with high-resolution screens. The <em>Wide Viewing Angle</em> feature ensures that the displayed color remains accurate even if the screen is being viewed from an angle, particularly useful during presentation setups where multiple viewers congregate around the screen, making it easier for others to view what is being showcased on the screen. Having an <strong>anti-glare screen</strong> is indeed a welcome feature if your work environment is near a window or under bright office lighting, where it becomes possible to view the screen without the botheration posed by overwhelming reflections.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Pro is an improvement over the last edition in terms of the benefits it offers for professional usage. You enjoy <em>BitLocker</em>-protected storage for secure storage of your files, the ability to connect to other computers using Remote Desktop, allowing access from any location, and joining a domain if you’re connecting from your company’s network. With the “Pro” version Off Windows 11, you have more flexibility with Windows Update so you can delay feature updates so that it doesn’t restart in the middle of a critical operation.</p>
<p>Dell also bundles a comprehensive accessory package with its laptop which actually provides value addition rather than mere inflation in the box. You can expect to get a <strong>stylus pen for operating the touchscreen display, a camera privacy cover for those concerned with security, a 128GB USB storage drive for transferring files quickly, dust plugs for protecting the ports, a laptop sleeve, and even a microfiber cloth</strong> for cleaning the system.</p>
<p>At $959, it’s an historic low for a laptop with such specs coupled with the Windows 11 Pro license.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment's latest role-playing game, The Outer Worlds 2, is here, and there's a lot to do in this new space-faring adventure. The planets you visit have bigger maps to run through, there are more weapons to use and modify, people to meet and talk to, and plenty more.</p>



<p>But there are five things that you should absolutely do first, right when you get off your ship, the Incognito, and touch down on the planet Eden and on Paradise Island. They'll make your playthrough run a lot smoother, and start you off on the right foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-guide-do-these-five-things-first">The Outer Worlds 2 Guide - Do These Five Things First</h2>



<h3 id="h-get-the-double-jump">Get the Double Jump</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration is a key gameplay element in The Outer Worlds 2, and it becomes a lot easier once you unlock the ability to double jump, which you can do almost immediately when landing on Paradise Island. </p>



<p>It starts by finding Heull Chaundry, a down-on-his-luck Auntie's Choice businessman who was kicked out of the saloon in Fairfield for not being able to pay his tab. Speak to him, and start his sidequest. That'll put you on the path to discovering the P.A.L.E. Boots, which let you double jump.</p>



<p>If you don't speak to Heull or investigate where Ida Rutledge is hiding as you continue through the first major quest of getting into the Vox Relay, then you won't head to Spire Grove, where you can find the boots. Otherwise, you'll run through the whole game without being able to reach certain additional areas, and miss out on extra resources, weapons, armour pickups, etc.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-a-plasma-shock-biomass-weapon">Get a Plasma/Shock/Biomass Weapon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elemental damage is huge in The Outer Worlds 2. It's far more important to pay attention to weapons that have elemental damage than just their overall damage output. That's why you want to have one in your arsenal as soon as possible. </p>



<p>Whether you choose Shock, Plasma, or Biomass (though personally I'd recommend Shock or Plasma to start), your elemental damaging weapon will be the best weapon in your loadout and help you tear through combat encounters without issue, even when you're just starting out.</p>



<h3 id="h-grab-the-commando-perk-add-an-extra-holster">Grab the Commando Perk/Add an Extra Holster</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can only choose so many perks on your way to level 30, which is as high as the levelling system goes in The Outer Worlds 2. You don't get to pick a new Perk with every level, so you have to really think carefully about which ones you choose.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is an RPG, and there's technically no wrong answer, but one of the first perks you should pick up, if not the first one, is Commando. It'll unlock a third holster in your loadout, letting you carry three weapons at a time instead of two.</p>



<p>If you don't want to pick Commando, you can still unlock that third weapon holster with the 'Extra Holster' helmet mod that's available at the first vendor you'll find in Fairfield. If you pick Commando and equip a helmet with the Extra Holster mod, you'll be able to carry four weapons at a time.</p>



<p>Whichever way you do it, you'll be far better off with at least three weapons on hand instead of two, since it leaves enough room for weapons with different ammo and damage types, giving you options in combat without having to dig through the menu to switch weapons mid-fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-buy-ammo-crafting-recipes">Buy Ammo Crafting Recipes</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll always be able to buy whatever ammo you need at vending machines and vendors in towns, but you might not always have a vending machine nearby when you need it. There might be a workbench, or you might have Niles in your party who is essentially a workbench on the go, but nowhere to buy ammo.</p>



<p>That's why you need to buy crafting recipes for different ammo types as soon as you see them. They should be the first things you buy, even before a new weapon or a new piece of armour. Crafting ammo is only possible if you have the recipe in the first place, so buy all the ammo crafting recipes for the starting ammo types once you make it to Fairfield. Also, as new ammo types appear the deeper into the game you get, make sure to grab those recipes as they become available.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-toxicity-draining-armour">Get Toxicity Draining Armour</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Inhaler is the only method of healing you have while in the middle of a fight, even if you have swaths of food resources that can heal you. You can't eat mid-combat, so those resources can't help you. You have to use your Inhaler, but using it increases your toxicity levels.</p>



<p>Those levels decrease over time as the toxicity drains, but the time you wait can be the difference between surviving a fight or not, depending on if you're able to get to cover quickly.</p>



<p>Your toxicity can drain faster than the standard rate, and the easiest way to do that without putting points into skills and perks that'll help with your toxicity drain is by wearing armour that increases your toxicity drain. This is a feature you'll be able to find with certain helmets, and it's worth wearing them for this exact reason.</p>



<p>Also, it's worth it to get better armour in general. Your starting armour isn't very protective, and whether you buy it from the vendor in Fairfield or take it off a corpse, you'll want to grab new armour as soon as you can to help you survive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is keen to revive the Halo series for the current generation with an all-new take on the classic <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for Xbox Series X|S, PC, Steam, and PlayStation 5 for the first time. The announcement of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> marks a faithful and modernized remake of the original story rebuilt on a modern engine with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics and controls, and three brand-new prequel missions starring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson. This new version of the game will also include a broader cache of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying Skulls - operational mods that can alter combat in challenging ways and increase replayability.</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is exactly what its title suggests - focused on the original Halo campaign. That means on console, 2-player split screen will satisfy the multiplayer requirement, while up to 4 people can play co-op online with full crossplay and cross-progression support enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> promises the original missions, but rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding to keep the pace moving. The soundtrack has also been remastered with sound design updated for better immersion, and new voice performances have been recorded with the main cast.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> has made adjustments to sprint, aiming, and for the first time, the ability to wield nine iconic weapons from across the Halo series including the Energy Sword, Battle Rifle, and Needle Rifle. The new prequel missions also introduce a new gameplay arc with new environments, characters, and enemies.Vehicle gameplay is enhanced too with the ability to hijack enemy rides and pilot a fully controllable Wraith for the first time.</p>

<p>The first look at <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> can be seen in action with the reveal trailer linked below. The current release window is set for sometime in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-this-60-000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-anker%E2%80%99s-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1334593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The little 10,000mAh power banks you see everywhere are fine for topping up your phone once, maybe twice if you’re lucky. But when you’re camping for the weekend, dealing with a power outage or spending a full day at an outdoor event, that tiny capacity just doesn’t cut it. You need serious juice, and that’s exactly what the Anker <em>PowerCore</em> delivers. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">has slashed this beast of a power bank from $149 down to just $79</a>, which is an all-time low for a device packing a <strong>massive 60,000mAh capacity</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 60,000mAh capacity translates to <strong>192 watt-hours of stored energy</strong> which means you can charge an iPhone 17 more than 10 times over or keep a 3-watt LED lamp running for over 42 hours straight. That’s the difference between fumbling in the dark during a blackout and having reliable lighting for nearly two full days. The <strong>dual USB-C ports deliver 60 watts and 27 watts respectively</strong> so you can fast-charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h2>A Backup Generator That Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>Anker built this power station with emergencies in mind and it’s apparent in its design. There’s a built-in light on top of the power station that’s retractable; it’s incredibly bright which makes it perfect for nighttime campsite setups or traveling during power outages. Still, the feature that stands out in terms of safety is its dedicated SOS button for an emergency strobe light function. The intelligent display screen on the front lets users know exactly what their power levels, wattage output, and time left are, so they’re never surprised by a power level status they can’t gauge on their own in the absence of wall power access.</p>



<p>The solar panel compatibility is what elevates it from a mere power bank to a off-grid system on its own: You can hook up a compatible solar panel via the input socket to charge it using only sunlight which is fantastic for long camping ventures or readiness systems for power outages. Charging the system is quite easy; simply hook up the USB-C to USB-C charging cord to a wall socket so it only takes 5-6 hours using your wall socket’s wattage, which is quite acceptable for such massive capacity.</p>



<p>As for the build quality, it’s definitely robust without being completely bulky either. Of course, it’s a bit heavier, thanks to the presence of battery cells but it is something that can be easily thrown into a backpack or even into an auto-emergency kit in your car, if need be. The build quality appears to be more resilient to rough handling, which is quite an aspect if one is supposed to be using it outdoors, say in an RV during an adventure vacation. Anker warrants it with a three-year warranty, which is an assurance on their own part regarding its durability.</p>
<p>At $79, <strong>this deal represents a 47 percent discount</strong> and brings the price per watt-hour down to an incredibly competitive level. Most portable power stations in this capacity range still hover around $120 to $200 so catching this at under $80 is fantastic.</p>

<p>The worst level in Halo: Combat Evolved is getting some much-needed changes in Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Announced at the Halo World Championships,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>&nbsp;remakes the 2001 classic Halo: Combat Evolved. The game will tell the original story of Master Chief and Cortana beating the Covenant and saving the universe. As a campaign-only title, the game is set to release in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and, for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. With excitement about the gameplay alive and well, the team told Xbox Wire about a change to the controversial Library level.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-is-changing-the-library-level-developers-confirm">Halo: Campaign Evolved is Changing The Library Level, Developers Confirm</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">a blog post from Xbox Wire</a>, members of Halo: Campaign Evolved’s development team spoke on the remake. Max Szlagor, the game’s Creative Director, talked about changes being made to certain levels that weren’t done for the Anniversary Edition. Chief among them was the dreaded Library level. Speaking on it, Szlagor said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>&nbsp;that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” Szlagor states <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">in the blog</a>. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out. We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you played Halo: Combat Evolved, you know how annoying The Library level is. Countless droves of The Flood and horrible level design made it a challenging chore. Fortunately, new fans, like those on PlayStation, won’t have to suffer much. Plus, with new dialogue for Guilty Spark, the intriguing lore will get the justice it deserves. From developer comments, a lot of changes are in the works for the game, so returning players will have new content to look forward to.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see The Library getting changes for Halo: Campaign Evolved? What are your feelings about the level? Will you be getting the remake? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">The newly revealed </a><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> an Unreal Engine 5 remake of 2001’s <em>Halo</em>, isn’t just a graphical update of the original game. The devs are making some big changes to the classic <em>Halo</em> experience, and this includes changing levels. And yes, if you were wondering, The Library is one of the levels getting tweaked.</p> <p>Ask 100 random <em>Halo</em> fans what the worst level in the first game is, and 90 or more will likely say “The Library.” This late-in-story level is very long, filled with never-ending waves of Flood, aka space zombies, and has limited supplies, checkpoints, and waypoints. It also lacks visual variety and can be a dull experience on lower difficulties and a pain in the ass for those playing on higher difficulties who enter unprepared. To help players in 2025, Halo Studios is making some changes to <em>Halo’s</em> infamously annoying level.</p>

 <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an October 24 blog post</a>, Halo Studios and Xbox explained that with Library, “it felt right to make tweaks to several areas” to create a “new experience that balances nostalgia with the expectations of today’s gamers.”</p>

 <p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em> that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” said <em>Halo </em>creative director Matt Szlagor. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out.”</p>

 <p>He further added: &nbsp;“We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/">Speaking to <em>Rolling Stone</em>,</a> executive producer Damon Conn claimed that every mission, encounter, and cinematic in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> has been “rebuilt and retouched with the spirit intact of the original’s awe, sense of discovery, and heroism.” Hopefully, that means the Library won’t look like the same boring grey corridors over and over again for 20 minutes.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo, once the flagship Xbox exclusive, the video game Microsoft launched its first console with, has finally jumped ship. Microsoft has announced Halo: Campaign Evolved — a remake of the original game’s campaign — and it’s coming to PlayStation 5 day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unreal Engine 5 remake of the Bungie-developed 2001 campaign is set for launch in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and, crucially, PS5. It is the first new Halo game since 2021’s Halo Infinite, and the first Halo ever to release on a PlayStation console. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions">IGN has played Halo: Campaign Evolved and has all the details right here</a>, including first info on the new three-mission prequel story arc. And yes, if you were wondering, there’s crossplay, which means Xbox, PC, and PlayStation owners can play Halo co-op together for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved is the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive, then, although in truth the shooter series’ release on PlayStation does not come as any surprise. Xbox Game Studios is already one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation, and just this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Xbox president Sarah Bond called the idea of exclusive games “antiquated,”</a> so Microsoft’s thinking on this is crystal clear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what has prompted Microsoft’s multiplatform push? A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report alleged that Microsoft is pushing Xbox studios to deliver a 30% margin — much higher than the industry average — and one of the ways studios can help bring in more money is by releasing their games on rival platforms, such as PlayStation and Nintendo Switch as well as PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One prominent critic of the exclusive is former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>last year said that when a video game’s costs exceed $200 million, “exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/how-former-playstation-boss-views-gamings-tumultuous-time-shawn-layden-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a>, before citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which launched on PlayStation 5 and PC to explosive success. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open. Helldivers 2 has shown that for PlayStation, coming out on PC at the same time. Again, you get that funnel wider. You get more people in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden said single-player games have a similar audience consideration as multiplayer games, though not exactly the same. “For single-player games it’s not the same exigency,” he said. “But if you’re spending $250 million, you want to be able to sell it to as many people as possible, even if it’s just 10% more.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden’s comments echo those of former Xbox boss Peter Moore, who in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>a recent interview with IGN</u></a> suggested Microsoft will be debating internally whether to release Xbox poster-child Halo on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said. “I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s stance on exclusives has become one of the biggest talking points in the Xbox community, and that conversation will only grow louder now we know Halo has made the jump to PlayStation. Microsoft’s approach is in stark contrast to Nintendo and Sony’s. Nintendo has the most hardline policy on its games, releasing them on its consoles only. Sony has softened its approach in recent years, releasing its multiplayer, live service games on PC at the same time as PlayStation (and in the case of Helldivers 2, eventually on Xbox). But Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Campaign Evolved is confirmed for PS5, there is no going back for Halo. Indeed, it seems Halo is from this day forward as much a PlayStation game as it is an Xbox game. Speaking tonight on a panel at the Halo World Championships 2025, Halo Community Director, Brian Jarrard, teased: "It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-project-update-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">everything announced at Halo Studios’ Halo: Campaign Evolved panel for more</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect when I sat down in front of an Xbox Series X to play an early demo of Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original-Xbox killer app (and yes, it’s a proper remake, not a remaster like Halo Anniversary was). And I’m honestly still not sure exactly how I feel about it after playing it. I definitely wanted to be blown away by the visuals, in the same way that the original Halo: Combat Evolved knocked my socks off back in 2001. Heck, we know Unreal Engine 5 is fully capable! I also didn’t want Halo Studios (nee 343 Industries) to mess with too much. Or did I? Would Halo 1 just feel old no matter what? And will PlayStation 5 gamers even care about this 25-year-old Xbox classic when it hits Sony’s consoles for the first time ever, day-and-date with Xbox and PC? So I went in with lots of questions, and I left with, well…some answers. Let me explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose we might as well start with the obvious: how it looks. Is my face properly melted? No. But maybe yours is? I’ll be curious to read the comments on this one. Anyway, Campaign Evolved does look very nice, no doubt. It certainly doesn’t look like it’s two decades old anymore. I played a chunk of the legendary Silent Cartographer mission from early in the campaign, and the skybox is beautiful, the water looks great, the trees look very nice, and the terrain texture looks sharp and clean. Once you get indoors, the alien architecture has a unique sheen to it that the original obviously never had. Meanwhile, the weapons all look exactly how you’d expect them to look in the modern era, and the Grunts, Jackals, Elites, and Hunters all look convincingly new rather than reskins of quarter-century-old creatures. Everything looks clean, but not in a soulless way. At least not to me. It works as a cohesive art-directed space in the new engine. I appreciate that VO from the principal actors (read: Steve Downes and Jen Taylor, at the very least) has been rerecorded, while mocap has all been redone for the rebuilt-from-scratch cutscenes. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk about my biggest concern coming into this demo: the classic Halo feel. Movement, aiming, jumping, vehicle controls – it’s all got to have that semi-floaty Halo feel to it, and I’m pleased to report that even in this very early state, Campaign Evolved is a good bit of the way there. No doubt they’ll continue to tweak it over the coming months – this release has no official release date beyond “2026,” by the way, but I’d be stunned if it’s not timed to release at or very near the 25th anniversary of Halo: Combat Evolved in November of next year – but there have been some gameplay modernizations implemented here that have been ported back from subsequent Halos into this remake, and while purists might bristle at it, most of these seem like they’re for the best for a 2026 first-person shooter release.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Vehicles are boardable and destructible now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, vehicles are boardable and destructible now, as they were in subsequent Halo games. That means a Ghost can no longer torment you endlessly, nor are you effectively invulnerable in a Scorpion tank. On a related note, a fourth player can now sit on the back of a Warthog. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it out on The Silent Cartographer, the Wraith is drivable now, too, as it first became in Halo 2. Also, any weapons the bad guys wield, you can too. As such, the Energy Sword is now in your toolbelt if you take one off the corpse of a Gold Elite. Halo Studios says there will be eight weapons in Campaign Evolved that aren’t new to Halo but are usable for the first time in Master Chief’s first adventure. On the movement front, sprint has also been added. It’s not on a cooldown; you can run endlessly. I could see this one annoying the Halo 1 purists most of all, but not only do the developers say you can turn it off, but you can also just…not use it. I found it handy when running down the beach back towards my mission objective after wandering off to go stare at more of the new Unreal Engine 5-rendered spaces. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What about co-op? After Halo Studios fumbled that in Halo Infinite, you’re probably wondering about it for the remake. Two-player split-screen is confirmed, though sadly it wasn’t available in my short preview build, and the development team also promises four-player online co-op with full cross-play and cross-progression support. As for proper competitive multiplayer, though? Unfortunately, the answer to that is right in the name of this remake: Campaign Evolved. There’s no multiplayer here, which is a shame because it’d sure be fun to see Blood Gulch or Sidewinder or Hang ‘Em High in Unreal Engine 5 with online cross-play support. I asked Halo Studios about this, and Executive Producer Damon Conn gave me an extremely media-trained answer, saying the team is “very focused on recreating the original campaign that started it all” and “[Halo] Infinite and [Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Sure…for Xbox and PC players. That doesn’t help new PS5 players fall in love with Halo’s glorious multiplayer, though. Presumably they didn’t want to pull any players away from MCC for this, and/or adding full multiplayer support would’ve likely meant the project couldn’t get done in time for the 25th anniversary. But it’s still disappointing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That led me to wonder about pricing. Would this be a full-price $70 release (or perhaps even $80 by the time it comes out, since Microsoft already tried to push to that price point this year)? Or will it be priced lower – particularly since it’s campaign-only? The Halo Studios team wouldn’t say when I asked them directly, so that remains to be seen. Personally, $50 feels right for this, but that’s just my opinion. I also think that $20 per month feels like the right price for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate… </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, so no multiplayer, but there is one significant addition I’m legitimately excited about: a new three-mission prequel campaign that revolves around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. This could be extremely cool, but unfortunately that’s literally all we know so far. In fact, Halo Studios wouldn’t even tell me if it’s accessible out of the box or if you have to complete the campaign in order to unlock it. I also asked if they’d be repurposing existing music from the Halo 1 soundtrack to score those missions, or if they might commission something new (dare I dream they reach out to Marty O’Donnell himself!), and they didn’t have an answer for me there either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting back to gameplay, I must say that I still had fun hooning across the beaches of The Silent Cartographer in a Warthog, my UNSC Marine buddies in the passenger and gunner seats helping to mow down Covenant bad guys while I attempted to turn them into hood ornaments with my front bumper. Just like old times. I also manned the gun turret at one point to test out the friendly AI and…it still needs work. In fact, someone on the development team acknowledged this later without me bringing it up, so it’s clearly something they’re aware of. Honestly, though, it’s not something I’m even worried about when there’s still (probably) upwards of a year of development time left. It’s the same with the framerate: no doubt some folks went straight to the comments to note any inconsistencies they saw (because I definitely noticed some), and while it is certainly important, it’s not something I’m sweating this far away from the end of the project. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-07-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and I should also mention that Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved. Lots of them, in fact. “Dozens” was the word they used, with an emphasis on this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever. Replayability is clearly a focus for the studio here – which is understandable, given Halo’s strong history in that department as well as the lack of adversarial multiplayer – and hopefully the Skulls will spice things up for Xbox players running through this thing for the umpteenth time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Halo Studios says this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, I couldn’t help but wonder if PlayStation 5 players getting their first crack at Halo are really going to care about this in a way that turns a lot of them into new fans of the franchise. It’s a genuine question; I’ve got a lot of personal history with Halo, so I simply can’t answer this one. For someone with no nostalgia for Master Chief, will those players find Campaign Evolved as compelling as I found Combat Evolved? And if they do, then what? Will Halo Studios remake Halo 2 in Unreal Engine 5? And then 3? 4? 5? Reach? ODST? Infinite? Or will they just port The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to PS5 to catch those players up? I asked the team about this and again got a very media-trained half-answer: “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase,” Executive Producer Damon Conn told me. “We're bringing the most players, we believe, to Halo, ever. And so that growth is what we're truly interested in, and again, I hinted before this paves the way for future stories and Halos.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/hce-warthong-4k-03-1761333970798.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, as you can now see, I’m still left with many unanswered questions about this remake project. But to Halo Studios' credit, this early demo did answer a couple of key ones about how good it could look and how Halo-y it could feel. So far so good there. I’m very excited about the new three-mission prequel campaign featuring Sergeant Johnson, as it will be the first new single-player content in a Halo game in, by that point, five years. Can Campaign Evolved relight Halo’s spark? That’s the biggest question of all, and it’ll have to remain unanswered for a bit longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Halo Studios has created something special for the 25th anniversary of <em>Halo </em>next year. <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is a full remake of the original <em>Combat Evolved</em> that launched alongside Microsoft’s first Xbox console in 2001. It has a fully rebuilt campaign with 4K visuals, new weapons and vehicles, a four-player online co-op mode, and brand-new story content.</p><p>And it’s all coming to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and — for the first time — PlayStation 5 in 2026.</p><p>I’ve been playing a prerelease demo section of The Silent Cartographer mission this week to get a feel for all the changes. It’s the same level that was used as the demo version of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for both Mac and PC, but this remade version opens immediately with updated cinematics, improved voice lines, and greatly overhauled visuals and animations.</p><p>It looks and feels distinctively <em>Halo</em>, but then I started sprinting toward a rebuilt Warthog that has an extra seat at the rear and I realized there’s a lot going on in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> beyond its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals.</p><p>“We did this work on <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary"><em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em></a>. There were certain things that we weren’t able to achieve at that time, there were certain things we weren’t able to do,” says Greg Hermann, technical director at Halo Studios. “As we were building this out, we didn’t just put a coat of paint over the original cinematics. We ended up revisiting exactly how they were blocked out, how they were sequenced, and how they were put together. We’ve done that across the board.”</p><p>Halo Studios even brought in the core voice actors of <em>Combat Evolved</em> to re-record their lines. It was something I noticed immediately as The Silent Cartographer mission loaded in. “This really provides a degree of fidelity that we weren’t able to do for <em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em>,” says Hermann.</p><p>The iconic vistas in <em>Halo </em>have also been rebuilt, as well as the alien architecture and environments. It’s really designed to be the ultimate remake of the original campaign that’s both welcoming to new players and also built in a way that respects Bungie’s original creation and story.</p><p>“Whenever we make a change, the number one thing is to be true to the original game,” says Dan Gniady, lead game designer at Halo Studios. Gniady joined Halo Studios last year and previously worked on the original releases of Bungie’s <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2 </em>titles.</p><p>Halo Studios has access to the original source assets and code for <em>Halo</em>, as well as the original storyboards. That’s allowed the team to remaster and remix the music alongside the cinematic change and huge visual upgrades. All of the new content in the game is created in UE5, and it’s layered on top of the systems and code used for the original game to maintain that unique <em>Halo</em> feel.</p><p><em>Campaign Evolved </em>includes three new bonus missions. “It was really important that we preserved the original story as it is, so these missions are meant to be a prequel setup for the main chorus,” says Max Szlagor, studio design director at Halo Studios. “These new missions are going to offer some new opportunities for character interactions between Chief and Johnson.” The missions will include new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies.</p><p>There are also new mechanics and AI behaviors. Perhaps the most obvious is the ability to sprint in the game, which makes everything from combat to moving around missions feel a lot faster. There’s even a new seat in the Warthog, affectionately referred to as the golf cart seat or bumper seat by Halo Studios’ developers. It will be ideal for co-op missions, as someone can now hang off the rear of the Warthog.</p><p>Up to four people can play this campaign together online, regardless of what platform they’re on, thanks to crossplay and shared progression across console and PC. There’s also two-player split-screen co-op local play on consoles, just like the original game. “We will make some of the spaces larger, and we also want to make sure we’re authentic to the encounters themselves,” says Szlagor. “So it’s a balancing act between that difficulty tuning and making those encounters the right size for the right space.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has rebuilt every part of the original game so movement, aiming, and weapons and look and feel like a modern </em>Halo<em> game.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>All of the weapons have been remodeled and rebuilt with higher fidelity, so the look, feel, and sound of weapons is far better than what Halo Studios achieved with the remastered versions; the plasma effects from guns will even fully light up the indoor environments. You can also aim down sights with all guns now, and there are nine additional weapons from across the <em>Halo </em>series available in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> — including the ability to pick up an Energy Sword after you’ve killed an Elite. If you’re a fan of the vehicles in <em>Halo</em>, you’ll even be able to hijack enemy ones, so you can pilot a fully drivable Wraith in this campaign.</p><p>If you want to amp up the difficultly, Halo Studios is leaning even more on skulls in this remake, the gameplay modifiers from <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>. There are dozens of skull options in <em>Campaign Evolved</em>, “the most we’ve ever had in a <em>Halo </em>game,” says Szlagor. There are so many that the developers don’t think it will even be possible to complete the game on legendary mode with all skulls turned on. “There’s a lot, so if you can do a true legendary all-skulls-on run, let us know because I’d love to see it,” says Gniady. I’m sure a hardcore <em>Halo </em>fan will find a way next year, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has remade entire environments in </em>Campaign Evolved<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The one thing that’s missing from <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is multiplayer. The original game had local multiplayer and maps, but it launched before Xbox Live, so there was never any official online multiplayer. While the PC version added online play, Halo Studios is sticking purely to the campaign element of the original <em>Halo </em>game. The <em>Halo </em>franchise is known for its multiplayer, but this really started with <em>Halo 2</em>. I did ask Microsoft to comment about the lack of multiplayer, but the company refused to discuss it.</p><p>Even without multiplayer, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is a blueprint for future <em>Halo </em>games. “For future titles, we will continue to push the boundaries of technology while ensuring the core <em>Halo </em>gameplay for that game can be seen, felt, heard, and evolved where needed,” says Hermann.</p><p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is coming in 2026 to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and PS5. It’ll be a day one game with Game Pass Ultimate / PC Game Pass, and will also support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Microsoft and Halo Studios announced they’re remaking the original&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>again as&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></a>. The remake is sprucing up the shooter’s campaign, adding three new prequel levels, and will support up to four-player cooperative runs. The biggest news out of the announcement, however, is that the game is also coming to PlayStation 5, and it sounds like Master Chief’s adventures will also be coming to PlayStation for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>This was confirmed on a livestream from the Halo World Championship after the remake’s announcement. Halo Studios community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard said that&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>is a multiplatform series “going forward.” The remake supports crossplay between platforms, so if you want to get your old co-op buddies together after 25 years, you can do that no matter what system they’re playing on. And it sounds like that will be the case with future games, as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Halo will be on PlayStation "going forward" starting with the Combat Evolved remake. <a href="https://t.co/y23v1B3mfV">pic.twitter.com/y23v1B3mfV</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jarrad teased that Halo Studios may have more&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>announcements for PlayStation 5 owners in the future, saying, “As the Master Chief once said: ‘I think we’re just getting started.'” If the series is coming to a new audience this many entries in, I wouldn’t be surprised if we also see the <em>Master Chief Collection&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation in the coming years. The compilation includes all the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games up to&nbsp;<em>5: Guardians</em>, including the spin-offs&nbsp;<em>Reach&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3: ODST</em>, which don’t follow Master Chief but instead tell separate stories in Bungie and Halo Studios’ sci-fi universe. This would also be as good a time as any to bring <em>Guardians</em> and&nbsp;<em>Infinite</em>, the two most recent games in the series which aren’t included in the collection, to PlayStation 5 as well.</p> <p>All of this comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reports of Microsoft enforcing new profit goals</a> on its Xbox division, seemingly resulting in a complete rethinking of the gaming brand’s direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Halo: Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">we've all been anticipating today</a>, as part of the Halo WCC, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">has finally been announced</a>. Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake that Halo Studios and Xbox describe as "<em>a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign</em>." It'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>We've officially seen it all now, with all of Microsoft and Xbox's biggest first-party franchises making their way to PlayStation. It was the inevitable endpoint we all saw when Halo Studios (formerly 343 Studios) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-halo-infinite-impact-vision/">dropping the Slipspace Engine and moving to using Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>It's both exciting and surreal to see Halo making its way to PlayStation for the first time. You can check out the trailer for the remade campaign, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what's new in this remake, the answer is pretty much everything, since all of the assets, models, environments, everything has been redone and retooled for Unreal Engine 5, and to take advantage of all the features that engine brings along with it that Halo Studios couldn't do within the Slipspace Engine.</p>



<p>There are also three brand-new bonus missions that act as a prequel setup to the main campaign. The actual Combat Evolved campaign hasn't been changed with regards to how the story goes, these are new missions to give players a bit more than just a remake of the campaign.</p>



<p>Campaign Evolved also introduces four-player co-op for the whole campaign, letting you play through the campaign with three other people online. Also, even though Halo Studios never got it done for Halo Infinite, couch co-op is available for Campaign Evolved for two player co-op.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | Roundtable Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-tXi1NC_aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the trailer, and the above roundtable, which shares a little more about why Halo Studios went forward with Halo: Campaign Evolved at this point in time, we also got a full 13-minute gameplay showcase, which shows off the The Silent Cartographer level towards the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer – 13 Minute Gameplay Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what this new remake doesn't have, the big aspect missing that should be obvious, given the title of the remake, is that it doesn't include the game's multiplayer. It's just the campaign. If you want to play multiplayer in the style of Halo CE, then the Master Chief Collection remains your best option.</p>



<p>All things considered, this remake definitely looks impressive at first glance, but a huge element of what made Halo unique was how the game felt thanks to the Slipspace Engine and everything that Bungie got right about what makes a good first-person shooter all those years ago. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react when they get their hands on it at some point next year.</p>



<p>For now, you can wishlist the game on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

<p>PlayStation is finally getting a Halo game, Halo Studios confirms.</p>



<p>The battle between Xbox and PlayStation has gone on for almost two decades. Each company would try to outsell the other in consoles and games. However, despite all that the Sony-backed company had, Microsoft had Halo. The premiere FPS multiplayer series was seemingly undefeatable, even at its lows. Now, as Xbox has brought exclusive franchises like Gears of War to PlayStation 5, its golden goose has been let loose from the cage.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-is-getting-halo-combat-evolved-remake-in-2026">PlayStation is Getting Halo Combat Evolved Remake in 2026</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>At the Halo World Championships, Halo Studios confirms that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will launch on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox and PC consoles. The news appears at the end of the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, which reveals gameplay of the Combat Evolved remake. Furthermore, all upcoming Halo games will release on PlayStation consoles. However, it’s unknown if other titles, like Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo: Infinite, will come to the Sony console. The game, a remake of Combat Evolved, releases in 2026, but there is no release date. In addition, cross-play is now in the game, letting you play with players from other consoles.</p>



<p>Despite the competitive nature of the two companies, having Halo on another console is a good thing. As we’ve seen with games like Final Fantasy XVI, staying exclusive can hurt sales and restrict player bases. With Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PlayStation, more people can finally experience the series the way many of us had back in the day.</p>

<p>Halo: Combat Evolved Remake has now been confirmed by Halo Studios, and it’s coming quite soon.</p>



<p>For almost 30 years, Halo has revolutionized the FPS genre with its space opera military setting and great combat. As Xbox’s semi-flagship series, it’s now a household name and one every Xbox fan has played at least two times over. However, it all started with one of the original Xbox’s launch titles: 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved. Now, at the Halo World Championships, the team at Halo Studios revealed that what has relentlessly been leaked is, indeed, true.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-remake-of-combat-evolved-revealed">Halo: Campaign Evolved, Remake of Combat Evolved, Revealed</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, Halo Studios finally confirmed that a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is in development and will be released in 2026. The trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, shows off some impressive gameplay of fan-favorite scenes, complete with Master Chief in all his glory. The game, which brings back the original 2001 title, is called Halo: Campaign Evolved. As you can guess, the remake is now confirmed to be only the campaign, so no multiplayer will be included. It will also launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, a first for the series. The game will bring back split-screen and new crossplay across all consoles. During a development video, the team also said that new content, like interactions and scenes, will be added. </p>



<p>As mentioned before, a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved has been rumored for a while. After Halo Studios’ tease last year, leaks regarding an in-development, campaign-only version of the classic game showed up, with evidence becoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more real</a>. Luckily, they can be put to rest, as we’ll see the title reborn for the next generation of consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo is coming to PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Studios made an appearance at the Halo World Championship 2025 to announce that its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-studios-teases-deep-dive-on-what-its-been-working-on-at-an-october-panel-you-wont-want-to-miss"><u>previously teased new project</u></a> is a Halo: Combat Evolved Remake titled Halo: Campaign Evolved, and it’s coming to PC, Xbox Series X | S, and yes, even PS5. It’s a move that will see what is perhaps the most important Xbox-exclusive franchise coming to PlayStation for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-coming-in-summer-even-on-playstation"><u>numerous past remasters and PS5 ports</u></a>, news that a remake of the original Halo is coming to PS5 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise"><u>isn’t much of a surprise</u></a>, but it is a sign that Xbox’s relationship with Sony may just be getting started. The Halo Studios team had plenty more to talk about during its Halo: Campaign Evolved stream, so be sure to catch up on everything they had to share in our coverage below. You can also check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one?_gl=1*iiltsh*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTk1NDE1NTc4MC4xNzYxMzM4MDA4*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NjEzMzgwMDgkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjEzMzgwMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw">IGN’s hands-on preview</a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions"><u>our breakdown for everything we know so far</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Microsoft’s Mysterious Halo Studios Project Update?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo World Championship 2025 broadcast is running a bit behind, but that isn't stopping Microsoft from letting it slip that Halo: Campaign Evolved is on the way. An <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox store page</a> for the game, which is described as "a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign," appeared online today, just moments after the Halo Project Update stream was set to go live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience the original story rebuilt with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics, and refined controls, plus three brand-new prequel missions featuring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson," its official description says. "A broader arsenal of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying 'Skulls' – optional modifiers that change combat in fun and challenging ways – add fresh tactics and endless replayability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in a trailer shown on its store page, Halo: Campaign Evolved has a release window of 2026, with platforms including PC and Xbox Series X | S – and even PlayStation 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s Really Happening</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/halo-ps5-1761337613780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Halo: Campaign Evolved Is Coming to PS5. Image Courtesy of Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right – Halo is coming to PlayStation for the first time in 24 years. It’s an achievement many believed would never come to be, as console manufacturers pushed for exclusive experiences throughout the 2010s. That all changes in 2026, when Halo: Campaign Evolved launches. No specific release date has been shared yet, but there’s plenty to dissect until more is announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is not included in Halo Studios’ Unreal Engine 5 Halo remake, there is new story content. Three missions, specifically, are said to be in development, with the developers promising that players can expect to explore an arc focused on Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. It’s unclear how much Halo: Campaign Evolved will cost or how these new missions have been implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Join the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a brand-new arc set before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, featuring new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies," an official description says.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Are Other Halo Games Coming to PlayStation?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo fans aren’t strangers to refreshed versions of classic Bungie experiences, though. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection"><u>Master Chief Collection</u></a> remastered Combat Evolved and other Halo games for Xbox and PC many years ago. There’s no word on when or if specific Halo games, such as 2021’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite"><u>Halo Infinite</u></a> or 2010’s beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-reach"><u>Halo: Reach</u></a>, will also make their way to PlayStation 5 in the future. However, Halo Studios does say that "Halo is on PlayStation going forward starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't konw how Halo Studios plans to continue bringing Halo experiences to PlayStation players, but it's safe to say that today marks a completely new direction for Xbox.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Halo: Campaign Evolved?</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN got to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one?_gl=1*iiltsh*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTk1NDE1NTc4MC4xNzYxMzM4MDA4*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NjEzMzgwMDgkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjEzMzgwMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw">hands-on with Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> to see just how Halo Studios has changed the classic FPS ahead of its 25th anniversary. Our sneak peek included a gameplay demo focused primarily on The Silent Cartographer, an early mission that takes Master Chief to serene beaches that are now polluted with Covenant Grunts and Elites. It’s a familiar scene that’s been recreated with even UNSC troops and the iconic Warthog intact, all for longtime Halo enjoyers and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo remake has been reimagined for modern audiences, but it's not quite the same experience. Tweaks under the hood include vehicles that can be hijacked, with the Wraith now also driveable for the first time in the original Halo. Of course, the main difference between Halo: Campaign Evolved and the Combat Evolved original is the sleek new visuals it introduces thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 5. Plus, the the primary cast form the original is back, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Iconic vistas, alien architecture, and sci-fi wonders are reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations," an official description says. "The soundtrack has been remastered, the sound design updated for greater immersion, and new voice performances recorded with the primary cast."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Halo Project Update Livestream Begins</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a late start fueled by some tense matches of Halo Infinite, Halo Studios took the main stage at the Halo World Championship 2025 to talk about its not-so-mysterious project update. Included in the lineup of developers are Halo Studios' Brian "ske7ch" Jarrard, Max Szlagor, and Damon Conn, who finally, officially pulled back the curtain on Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team's Halo World Championship 2025 debut for the Halo remake includes behind-the-scenes details on the project, including interviews with the developers, where they promise two-player couch co-op on consoles and four-player online co-op – and there's even crossplay and cross-progression support. Don't worry, the Warthog has been updated to account for those larger party sizes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviews with the team also reveal how Halo Studios revisited classic stories fans know and love. This includes clips of Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) back in the studio to rerecord some of their most iconic lines. As for the story cinematics themselves, fans can expect the Halo remake to deliver something familiar but new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to tell an authentic story, and we want to level up the cinematics from the source," Halo Studios says. "As we were building this out, we didn't just put a new coat of paint over the original cinematics. We ended up revisiting exactly how they were blocked out, how they were sequenced, how they were put together, and we've done that across the board."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo Studios team signs off by welcoming the PlayStation community to the world of Halo, promising to provide updates as we move closer to the yet-to-be-confirmed Halo: Campaign Evolved release date in 2026. For those attending Halo World Championship 2025, a demo for the Halo remake, featuring The Silent Cartographer, is available to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As the community person," Jarrard said, "seeing this community grow, welcoming all of our friends and new players to the franchise is just so exciting. [We're] just kind of knocking down walls. We're going to come together, we're going to sing kumbaya – it's going to be great. Blue and green, coming back together again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
