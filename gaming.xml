This was business as usual, of course, but it turns out that the update accidentally included some adjustments that Nintendo was hoping to release further down the line. <em>Whoops</em>.</p>
<p>As revealed in a new post on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch/software_support/av5ja/1101.html">Japanese Nintendo support page</a>, the 11.0.1 update mistakenly tweaked the bullet splash ink coverage of the Rapid Blaster weapons, while the Rapid Blaster Pro had its ink consumption increased by approximately 14%. It's minor balancing, sure, but Nintendo was hoping to keep it up its sleeve for a while longer.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12esmkxnz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The company confirmed that the changes will remain in place for now, though they may be subject to further tweaks in the future.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP/status/2021089749130412388">X</a>, Nintendo confirmed that it's currently considering the contents of the next Splatoon 3 balance update, and it will reveal more information at a later date.</p>
<p>While the mistakenly-added adjustments can't be found in the 11.0.1 patch notes, you'll find everything else included in the latest batch of updates in our coverage below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, Riot's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting spin-off</a>, is having its development team significantly cut back not long after release. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> report a Riot spokesperson as stating the publishers have put plans in motion to lay off around 80 developers on the game, about half of the global team who've been working on it, with the potential for some of the affected workers to land in new posts at Riot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Riot's <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">official blog post</a> acknowledging the layoffs, attributed to 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon, doesn't offer any numbers.</p>
<p>"After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team," the post reads. "I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p>
<p>Cue words about a "smaller, focused team" needing to "dig in and make key improvements to the game" in order to give it "a more sustainable path forward". The post also makes clear that staff affected by the layoffs who aren't slotted into new positions at Riot will receive "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance". "The people who helped ship 2XKO poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game," Cannon added. "Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful."</p>
<p>Riot's plans for 2XKO's 2026 competitive events remain unchanged, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Following some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta">pre-release testing</a>, the fighting game which went by the codename Project L up until being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">christened 2XKO in 2024</a> finally released in early access late last year. A full release followed on January 20th, 21 days ago as I write this.</p><p>These 2XKO layoffs following two significant rounds of job cuts at Riot within the past couple of years. Around 530 workers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-fire-around-530-people-and-shut-down-riot-forge-label-in-push-for-sustainability">jettisoned in March 2024</a>, with Riot shuttering their Forge publishing label, and a further 32 staff being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">let go in October the same year</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite some missteps along the way and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-plummeted-lagging-behind-even-the-last-games-dlc-and-a-two-year-old-street-fighter-game">performance woes</a>, we maintain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a pretty good game. Complaints about difficulty and end-game content were addressed by Capcom in due course, but for anyone still a bit underwhelmed by the final offering, you only need to wait until the summer to see what's next.</p>
<p>Now, as we near the game's first anniversary, we've finally learned when we should expect to hear the first details about the traditional jumbo-sized expansion. Via an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">official blog post</a> (plus a video you can watch below), producer Ryozo Tsujimoto unveiled what's coming next to the game in time for the birthday celebrations plus the expected announcement window for the "large-scale expansion" that should shake things up:</p> <figure>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_NjU8O6qSQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As teased before the end of 2025, free content updates are ending (for now). Though we believed the December update would mark the end of pre-expansion support for Wilds beyond the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-january-2026-performance-update-released">promised performance improvements</a>, a new major patch coming on 18th February is adding a bunch of 10-star Arch-tempered monsters to slay in permanent event quests, new weapon and pendant designs from a design contest held a while back, and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>Starting 18th February, a month-long anniversary event celebration of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will bring seasonal festivities, a "special item pack", new event quests, and of course, all-new armour sets and cosmetics. That should be the end of new free content (though rotations of past events could happen) until the expansion is ready. Will it be as substantial as Iceborne or Sunbreak? We sure hope so.</p><p>"We look forward to sharing the first reveal of the expansion this summer," the shared video message promises, potentially pointing at one of the big summer showcases we tune into every year. Will that reveal come alongside an official announcement of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured port for Switch 2</a>? That seems like a solid bet, but it's also the kind of thing that could happen in any Nintendo Direct stream, so anything's possible.</p>

            <guid>1430749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>, which lands in exactly one week, game developer <strong>Game Science</strong> has released six minutes of in-game footage from the upcoming game <strong>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</strong>, a follow-up to the massively successful <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a></strong>. The content doesn't actually include anything that will be in the game itself; it's been crafted just for the celebration. However, it provides an early look at the visual upgrades that we'll see in the upcoming title.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong quickly became a sensation after its launch in August 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to the second spot of Steam's all-time concurrent player chart</a>, where it still sits today. In September, <strong>it had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 18 million units sold</a></strong>, and an expansion was supposed to be underway. However, the studio eventually ditched that plan in favor of fast-tracking a new game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> a few months ago to be titled Black Myth: Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui — 6 Min In-Engine Chinese New Year Special" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQ51gFl7kzk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, in an FAQ published on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, Game Science <strong>clarified that this isn't a direct sequel to Wukong</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design. Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui shares the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore. In terms of genre, it will remain a standard single-player ARPG, following the same business model as before. However, you won't be playing a monkey role this time. That said, we're still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui.</em></p>



<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui is currently in development for PC and consoles. Given that Wukong is still relatively new, <strong>we may have to wait 3 to 4 years before we can play this new title</strong>. Indeed, the FAQ still says the developer hasn't even finished the outline yet. Best get ready for a long wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> announced its new CEO. As you may remember, the previous Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Tero Virtala</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left in late October</a> after nine years in the studio following the <strong>financial disaster</strong> that was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a></strong>. The game, Remedy's first online multiplayer release, utterly failed to deliver a fun, replayable experience, a basic requirement for any successful online multiplayer game.</p>



<p>The newly appointed CEO is <strong>Jean-Charles Gaudechon</strong>. He has over twenty years of experience in the industry, including senior leadership roles at <strong>CCP Games</strong> and <strong>Electronic Arts</strong>, although recently he was a Senior Vice President and General/Group Manager for sports app OneFootball and fantasy sports platform Sleeper.</p>



<p>Gaudechon shared a brief comment to comment the news:</p>



<p><em>I’m excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time. The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry’s future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I’m incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio.</em></p>



<p>This morning, the developer posted its final quarter and full-year financial results, and they're quite positive. In Q4 2025, revenue increased by 46.3% to <strong>€17.0 million</strong> (compared to <strong>€11.7 million</strong> in Q4 2024), driven primarily by <strong>Alan Wake 2</strong> royalties and <strong>Control</strong> game sales. For the full year, revenue increased by 17.5% to <strong>€59.5 million</strong> (up from 2024's <strong>€50.7 million</strong>); operating profit was actually negative at <strong>-14.9 million</strong>, but that's only because of the non-cash impairment caused by the aforementioned FBC: Firebreak. Operating cash flow remained positive at <strong>€4.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Current interim CEO <strong>Markus Mäki</strong> (who will stay in the role until March 1, when Gaudechon officially takes over) clarified that Control sales <strong>reached 1 million in 2025 alone</strong>, most of which came after the announcement of the sequel, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, whose early reception was reportedly excellent:</p>



<p><em>Player and community sentiment has been very positive, indicated by engaged fans and positive wishlist numbers. <strong>Our goal is to make the game a 'must-have day-one purchase' for the fans of&nbsp;Control&nbsp;and the action role-playing genre</strong>. The announcement at The Game Awards in December was a great kickstart to the ambitious global marketing campaign we have planned for&nbsp;CONTROL Resonant.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, CONTROL Resonant is slated to launch this year, though it has no specific launch window yet. </p>

<figure data-uuid="9213102ac3a22"><a title="Rayman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9213102ac3a22/rayman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although Ubisoft has only just done a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a>, it's already been confirmed the mascot <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_legends_definitive_edition">Rayman</a> is part of the company's future plans.</p>
<p>Now, following a rating for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated"><strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong></a> last month, the series creator Michel Ancel has made some comments about a new project to <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/uk/retro-gamer-subscription/dp/fe2efd7d">Retro Gamer Magazine</a>, which would apparently see the return of the first Rayman game.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say, as highlighted by GamesRadar+ and some Rayman fans on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think there's a kind of remake planned. I don't remember when specifically, but it will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating. I think it's a nice move, because that's the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6gqokiu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>So, it really does look like this supposed revival is based on the first 2D Rayman game, which originally launched on the PlayStation in 1995. As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/rumoured-rayman-ps5-remaster-is-real-says-series-creator">colleagues at Push Square</a> further note, it <em>sounds</em> "like an enhanced remaster" timed with the original game's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">reports from last September</a> about a Rayman Remake being in development. Of course, we don't have an official confirmation just yet, but the evidence is mounting.</p>

<p>See how it holds up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There have been a bunch of demos released following last week's Partner Showcase, and one of them was for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/yKHAcYtToz8">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a> has now shared a side-by-side of this demo to showcase how the Switch 2 performance and resolution compares to the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 versions. The resolution is the lowest on the hybrid platform, and the uncapped frame rate hovers around 30fps.</p>
<p>The same video notes how the Switch 2 version shows "greater stability than the Xbox Series S version in docked mode" but in "portable mode it can fall below 30fps more often".</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this demo may not necessarily be 100% reflective of the final release in terms of the game's graphics, performance and gameplay, and is subject to change.</p>
<p>Once again, the Switch 2 trial demo for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is available to download right now from the eShop. Capcom has also confirmed you'll be able to transfer your save data to the full game when it arrives on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We should also have our own preview of this title up on Nintendo Life soon, so be on the lookout for that!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:197147,197251 @ 1770718759 -->

<p>But will it translate to sales?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="77fee97d0cb5e"><a title="Pragmata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77fee97d0cb5e/pragmata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last week, Capcom <em>finally</em> released the demo for its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2, allowing users to shoot and hack "on-the-go" or on the big screen at home.</p>
<p>Now, following this particular version of the sci-fi action-adventure trial rolling out on the eShop, the "combined downloads" of the "Sketchbook demo" across all platforms have officially hit the one million mark. Capcom has issued a small "thank you" notice to players today via social media.</p>
<p>Whether the demo's success will translate to actual sales is obviously not clear just yet, as we're still a few months from launch, but if you want to show your support for this upcoming release, you can pre-order it now on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've also gone hands on with this title recently and are thinking it could end up being one of the biggest surprises of the year. Here's what Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All eyes are on Resident Evil Requiem for this year, but Pragmata definitely has the potential to be something really special come 24h April 2026. Unlike Kunitsu-Gami, it feels like Capcom is making a real solid attempt to create its next big IP here, and while it certainly still has much to prove – I didn’t get a whole lot of narrative context during the demo, for example – its gameplay has done more than enough to bump it up to the top tier of my ever-growing wish list."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a new week, and it means Nintendo has updated its mobile music application with another video game soundtrack. This time, it's the album from the 2020 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a>.</p>
<p>According to the app, <strong>263 tracks</strong> have been added and there's a runtime of more than 11 hours! Nintendo notes how the tracklist includes songs such as "Red Streamer Battle, Autumn Mountain, and more". It joins the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube album, which is already available on the app.</p>
<p>Origami King had a whole host of composers including Shoh Murakami, Yoshiaki Kimura, Hiroki Morishita and Fumihiro Isobe, and it was led by Yoshito Sekigawa (who helped compose the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube title and has also worked on multiple other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario</a> games since then).</p>

<p>To access this album update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app, you'll need to have an active (and paid) Switch Online membership. You can find out more about the weekly Nintendo Music updates and this particular Paper Mario game in our existing coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Back in 2019 Riot announced a fighting game called <em>Project L</em>, which would later be renamed <em>2XKO</em>. Released into early access on PC in late 2025, it hit consoles in January 2026.</p><p>We should note the game was only <em>announced </em>in 2019; it had been in development much, much longer, as<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a Game Developer story from September 2025 reports</u></a>. That piece, which interviews Riot Games senior game producer Patrick Miller, says the "nearly" ten years of work (by September 2025) put into <em>2XKO </em>"was vital to make sure the game isn't KO'd in round one", that "it takes a lot of time and effort to unpack the 30+ years of lessons that the veteran [fighting game] studios have learned", and that "I often remind my teammates that it took seven Tekken games (and two Tekken Tag games) to get to <em>Tekken 8</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>Today, just three weeks after the game was released on console,<a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Riot announced</u></a> that<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"> <u>"roughly" <em>80 </em>members</u></a> of the development team are being let go because, in Riot's words, "the game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p><p><strong>UPDATE 9:30pm ET</strong>: <em>Miller posted earlier today on social media that he was one of the affected.</em></p><p>While work on the game will continue, the layoffs and statement make clear that whatever "passionate core audience" the game has found, it's nowhere the size Riot leadership were hoping for or expecting, which is weird considering they supported development for a decade to make sure the game wasn't "KO'd in round one", only to throw in 80 towels before it has even been out (formally at least) for a <em>month</em>.</p><p>Riot says the affected developers can either find work elsewhere within Riot or, if that's not possible, will be given "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance".</p>

<p>The estimates for its minute-long ad are through the roof</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> banks an insane amount every year, so it can afford to splash some cash from time to time. If you are wondering how much yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/jigglypuff-is-joined-by-up-and-comer-lady-gaga-in-pokemons-super-bowl-ad">Super Bowl LX commercial</a> might have cost, according to reports, it's estimated to have required "at least $16 million" for just a single minute.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://screenrant.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-budget-compared-games/">noted by ScreenRant</a>, this likely doesn't even factor in the "price of the ad itself, filming, and animating the Pokémon". And then there were mega stars such as Lady Gaga on display, who probably cost an arm and a leg to hire.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhqwtus&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>While this amount of coin might not seem like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/super-bowl-ad-prediction-market-contracts.html">big deal in the context of the Super Bowl</a> (or modern marketing budgets), this estimate has led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1qzur3b/it_just_hit_me_that_the_cost_to_air_the_super/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemons-super-bowl-commercial-was-probably-expensive-unsurprisingly">speculation and debate</a> about how much this single ad spot might cost compared to the development costs of the mainline video game entries. Although, as mentioned by the source, these same comparisons are based on "unconfirmed leaks for the budget" of the latest game.</p>
<p>But hey, keep in mind, Pokémon seemingly remains out in front as the <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56337-the-world-s-highest-grossing-media-franchises-revealed">highest-grossing media franchise of all-time</a>, with the series transcending the video games. And this is the 30th anniversary we're talking about here, so it's not necessarily a surprise to see The Pokémon Company spending big on the brand.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has already announced it will be celebrating this milestone anniversary in many different ways, including the release of a brand-new LEGO line later this month. Heck, TIME Magazine is even releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/time-magazine-reveals-special-edition-pokemon-30th-anniversary-covers">a special trio of Pokémon covers</a>, and we're sure we'll see some exciting announcements on Pokémon Day this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Just look at Ayaneo's absolute unit of a Windows gaming "handheld"]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/</link>
            <guid>1430605</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">Lenovo’s Legion Go</a>, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">unveiled details of its Next II handheld</a>, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/ayaneo-next.html">2022’s original Ayaneo Next</a>, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-%E2%85%A1">Ayaneo’s spec sheet</a>, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).</p>
<p>Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/review-asus-rog-flow-z13-tablet-takes-the-asterisk-off-integrated-gpus/">last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13</a>.</p>

              <p>An indie game gets raked over the metaphorical coals over a split second in its Steam trailer. Remedy Entertainment gets a new boss. And the publisher of<em> Arc Raiders</em> might be involved in a new <em>StarCraft</em> shooter. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Who’s ready to <a href="https://x.com/conzmoleman/status/2020112379304972716">get into UncBall</a>?</p> <h2><em>Void War</em> is back on Steam after a dispute over shoulder pads</h2> <p>The <em>Warhammer</em>-inspired<em> FTL</em> mash-up was removed from Steam last month over a DMCA takedown request. Thought to possibly be someone trolling at the time, it turned out the 2025 strategy game was very much on the receiving end of <em>Warhammer</em> owner Games Workshop’s actual ire.</p>

 <p>“After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs,” developer Tundra <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a statement. “They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that<em> Void War</em> is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as ‘the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.'”</p>  <p>Tundra ended up pulling the trailer to make the whole thing go away and the game is back up on Steam. “While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on,” it wrote. What a great system Valve has for hashing out frivolous complaints!</p>

 <h2>The owner of <em>Arc Raiders r</em>eportedly gets involved with <em>StarCraft</em></h2> <p>Korean publisher Nexxon signed a cooperation agreement with Blizzard to help it develop a project in the <em>StarCraft</em> universe according <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">to<em> Dnews</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">ResetEra</a>). It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-starcraft-far-cry-open-world-shooter-leak-fps-1851700828">previously reported</a> that Blizzard is working on bringing back <em>StarCraft</em> as an open-world first-person shooter. Maybe we’ll get an announcement or at least a tease for whatever this is at BlizzCon 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Mewgenics</em> fans go full cringe mode</h2> <p>Edmund McMillen and co-developer Tyler Glaiel asked players of the new roguelike to go act like kittens in public to win stuff online. <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpleSushii/status/2020279382464737372">They did exactly that</a>.</p> <h2>Remedy Entertainment gets a new CEO</h2> <p>Jean-Charles Gaudechon will take the role on March 1 as the studio gets ready to launch<em> Control 2</em> and hopefully, eventually, maybe tell people what’s up with the <em>Max Payne</em> remakes. He has creative director Sam Lake’s endorsement. “He very much understands our wildly unique vision and the value of the Remedy Connected Universe,” the Remedy veteran <a href="https://x.com/SamLakeRMD/status/2020929412972282195">wrote</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Replaced</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>Players can now go hands-on with Sad Cat Studios’ long-awaited, retro-futurist, pixel-art action game on Xbox and PC for themselves starting February 11. The game has been delayed a bunch but comes to Game Pass on March 12.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/littlestjeff1-epstein-files-fortnite-v-bucks-conspiracy-epic-2000666464">Epic calls the Jeffrey Epstein <em>Fortnite</em> account a hoax, but conspiracy theorists aren’t buying it</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407">Roblox promotes genAI and immediately rips off <em>Clair Obscur</em></a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-hundred-line-kazutaka-kodaka-deceive-company-2000666463"><em>Danganronpa</em> dev explains the only way to get good games made is to lie to your boss</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Is Steam Deck Verified, But I Wouldn’t Play It There If I Were You]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-deck-verified-bad-mess-performance-fps-settings-2000667017</link>
            <guid>1430569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> received a Steam Deck Verified badge. This should imply that the game is a great experience on <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s portable PC</a>. But that’s not the case. And worse, Gearbox removed the option to adjust the game’s advanced visual settings on Steam Deck for some strange reason.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">It’s no secret that when <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched late last year,</a> it had all kinds of performance problems on both console and PC. Patches helped a lot, but those first weeks were rough, with frequent crashes, FPS drops, and other issues making it hard to enjoy the open-world looter shooter. Since then, things have improved a lot. I’ve been replaying the game on PC and have had a great time. So I was hopeful that the recent news that <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/2019094762159214993"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is now Verified on Steam Deck</a> meant it would be a great way to play the game away from my desk. Well, that ain’t the case at all.</p>

  <p>As documented by a few different channels on YouTube, <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is technically playable, but looks extremely rough, features plenty of input lag, runs poorly at its default settings, and doesn’t at all seem worthy of Steam’s Verified badge. That’s supposed to signal to players that a game will be a great experience with no tweaking needed on the aging portable PC. But that’s simply not true of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck.</p>  <p>But the weirdest part of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is that for some odd reason, Gearbox has removed the advanced visual settings submenu from the game when playing on the portable PC. Yeah. I don’t know why Gearbox would do this, as it just makes it trickier for your average user to tweak <em>Borderlands 4</em> and make it possibly run a bit better on the Steam Deck. You can’t change the game’s resolution, shadow quality, draw distance, etc. It’s a baffling choice that makes an already bad way to play this game even worse.</p>

 <p>While Gearbox deserves some blame, I also think Valve needs to overhaul or update its Verified system. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">It’s becoming more and more common</a> to find Verified Steam Deck games that don’t seem to deserve that green checkmark at all. And as the Deck gets older, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">this problem is only going to get worse</a>.</p>

 <p>Seeing how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs on Steam Deck might provide some insight as to why Gearbox and 2K have indefinitely <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">delayed the Switch 2 port that was announced ahead of the game’s launch</a>. Maybe that version will one day see the light of day, but if it does, I really hope it looks and plays better than what I’m seeing on Steam Deck.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/">SpaceMolt</a></em> describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.</p>
<h2>“You decide. You act. They watch.”</h2>
<p>Getting an AI agent into <em>SpaceMolt</em> is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/">MCP</a>, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/skill.md">detailed agentic skill description</a> instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.</p>
<p>After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—"like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.</p>
<p>After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating <a href="https://www.spacemolt.com/map">the sparsely populated map</a>, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.</p>

			<p><strong>Riot</strong> has announced that the <strong>2XKO </strong>team, which just celebrated launching the new <strong>League of Legends-</strong>based 2v2 tag fighter out of early access less than a month ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">January 20</a>,</strong> will lose <strong>80 members of its development team</strong> in a round of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoffs</a></strong>. The news was confirmed in a blog post from the game's executive producer, <strong><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">Tom Cannon</a></strong>, who cited that despite the game doing well with its "<em>core audience</em>," the "<em>overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>While the statement itself doesn't cite the exact number of developers who were laid off, a report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> adds that a Riot spokesperson confirmed that approximately 80, which rounds out to approximately half of the game's initial development team, are losing their jobs.</p>



<p>"<em>As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO</em>," Cannon explained. "<em>The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</em>"</p>



<p>Cannon added that the plans for the upcoming 2026 Competitive Series remain "<em>unchanged</em>," and that this decision is a "<em>reshaping</em>" of the team, "<em>to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward</em>." Cannon also noted that the decision is not a reflection on any individual member of the development team, and that Riot is doing what it can to help the impacted developers.</p>



<p>Cannon concluded, "<em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</em> <em>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community</em>."</p>



<p>At the top of the year, 2XKO was one of Wccftech's<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/"> Most Anticipated Fighting Games of 2026</a>. Before that, even in its early access state, it made our list for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Best Fighting Games of 2025</a>. It's a bold fighting game with a strong aesthetic that gives players a fresh introduction to the League of Legends franchise and its characters that have lasted for so long.</p>



<p>This is the latest layoff in the video game industry, after January was already riddled with layoffs from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>

The game, set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe, launched in early access on PC <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-early-access-starts-october-7/">in October</a> and hit consoles <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/news/announcements/2xko-is-coming-to-console-january-20/">just a few weeks ago</a>.</p><p><em>2XKO</em> has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename <em>Project L</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915506/riot-games-league-of-legends-10th-anniversary-marc-merrill-interview">in 2019</a> as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond <em>League of Legends</em>. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">Netflix’s animated series <em>Arcane</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915322/riot-project-a-tactical-shooter-league-of-legends">tactical shooter</a> that would eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265402/valorant-riot-shooter-launch-date">become <em>Valorant</em></a>, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">as part of layoffs</a> affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for <em>2XKO</em> also reflect an increasingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down">competitive market</a> for live service games that has even proved difficult <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">for Sony to overcome</a>.</p><p>“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”</p><p>The cuts “affect roughly 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team,” Riot spokesperson Brian Chui tells <em>The Verge</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s New Fighting Game Is Already Imploding As It Lays Off 80 Developers Less Than a Month After Coming To Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2xko-layoffs-league-legends-riot-update-2000666998</link>
            <guid>1430521</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>2XKO</em> hasn’t even finished its <a href="https://kotaku.com/2xko-ps5-league-legends-fighting-game-issues-2000661845">first month out on PlayStation 5</a> and Xbox Series X/S and Riot Games is already cutting its losses. The<em> League of Legends</em> maker announced that it would be laying off 80 employees as the tag-teaming fight game fails to gain momentum.</p> <p>“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” executive producer Tom Cannon <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">wrote in a new blog post on February 9</a>. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”</p>

 <p>Featuring fighters from <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Runeterra universe, <em>2XKO</em> employs beautiful cel-shaded animations and tons of flashy combos. But it seems none of that was enough to help it make a huge splash in the fighting game community when it came to PC in Early Access last October. The game hit its 1.0 launch and arrived on consoles last month, where it became the third most-downloaded free-to-play game across PS4 and PS5, putting it ahead of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>That sounds…not bad considering the game’s existing trajectory, but apparently Riot was expecting something much bigger. Or maybe it was always the plan to cut the development team in half after release as the<em> League of Legends</em> company struggles to find success outside of its hit MOBA.</p>

 <p>Cannon said that there are no plans to pull the plug on 2XKO,and its remaining team will continue updating the game and carrying through with its year-one competitive plans. “Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” he wrote. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.”</p>

 <p>Cannon acknowledged how bad the layoffs and the timing sounded. “I know this update will raise questions and concerns,” he wrote. “That’s understandable.” But he didn’t have anything more concrete to share to reassure fans.</p>
