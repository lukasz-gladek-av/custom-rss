		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been announced by Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau, a brand new side-scrolling action game that’ll probably make you think you’re playing a remaster of an early 90s movie tie in. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC on 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, this is a real love letter to the film and 16-bit video games, but with all the potential that funnelling that through modern hardware can produce. There’s really slick animation, the sprite work is really high detail, and then there’s just so many moments that are being recreated from the film – in addition to some original stages.</p>
<p>Play as Sarah Connor, the T-800, and John Connor in the far future missions, with a blend of beat ’em ups, shooting and stealth.</p>
<p>This could be the Terminator 2 tie-in game that we never had. Except… we did have them. Lots of them. There was a computer game by a studio called Dementia – really quite a bad name for a games company – an arcade shooter by Midway, a Game Boy game by Bits Studios, and a 1992 NES game by Software Creations. Bits Studios returned in 1992, making a 16-bit version for SNES and Mega Drive. I have no idea if any of these games were good.</p>

<p>So, perhaps Bitmap Bureau design director Mike Tucker can put it a different way:&nbsp;“It’s a love letter to 80s/90s arcade games and we feel like it’s the T2 game we should have had back in our youth.”</p>
<p>To go alongside the game reveal and announcement is a Making Of video, where Tucker utters these words:</p>
<p><iframe title="Making Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPMqA-qqfWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Intriguingly, the way that the game has been developed is intended to allow them to port the game back to classic machines. The current console releases are set for 5th September, with other, older platforms yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Xbox’s excellent arcade racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5 on 29th April, it’s been confirmed, narrowing down the spring release window that was previously revealed.</p>
<p>This will also come alongside an update for the game on Xbox and PC that introduces the Horizon Realms</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 - Horizon Realms Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWd6ox2dgec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 release of Forza Horizon 5 will come in multiple editions, and with early access for pre-orders starting on 25th April. As with Xbox Series X, the PS5 will have a 60fps Performance and 30fps Quality mode. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will also have the same frame rate targets, but Performance mode will have increased visual fidelity, while PS5 Pro Quality mode will add ray-traced car reflections to races and free roam – these are otherwise limited to photo modes.</p>
<p>Horizon Realms will adapt the previously time-limited events from the Evolving World update, bringing back 11 locations and adding one more. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
<li>Horizon Stadium Circuit (new)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all be played in either Skill Score, which has you try to bank enough points to climb a leaderboard, or Free mode, which is all just about messing around and earning Badges.</p>
<p>It’s still a bit weird seeing Xbox first party exclusives popping up on PlayStation, but here we are. They even have their trailers appear on the PlayStation YouTube channel these days!</p>
<p>The port is being developed by Panic Button in collaboration with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, and will be like-for-like in terms of content with all the previously released car pack, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review/">Hot Wheels</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/24/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-expansion-revealed/">Rally Adventure</a> expansions also available.</p>
<p>This follows on from comments by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who said in the last few weeks that “To keep games off other platforms… it’s not a path for us.” This certainly tied in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/">the latest rumours</a> that had other core Xbox franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag-microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> potentially coming to PlayStation, and with Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-confirmed-for-may/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/rumours-grow-of-starfield-indiana-jones-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5/">Indiana Jones</a>, and Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> already confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 Review (Xbox Series X in 4K 60fps)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEl0KBy5I-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is the latest in Playground Games’ spectacular open world arcade racing spin-off to the main Forza Motorsport series. Where previous games took us to Australia and the UK, Forza Horizon 5 takes players to a gorgeous approximation of Mexico, really showcasing the variety of environments that you can find in the country.</p>
<p>Originally released in late 2021 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, t<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/halo-infinite-20-million-players-forza-horizon-5-18-million-but-how-many-bought-the-games/">he game set records for Xbox Game Pass at the time</a>. It’s over three years old now, and has had countless updates, car packs and a pair of great expansions as well. PlayStation 5 owners are in for a treat when it arrives.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon 5 review</a>, we scored the sequel a sublime 9 out of 10 with Dom saying, “Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-reaction-time-and-does-it-make-you-better-at-cs2-or-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reaction Time test</a> on the Human Benchmark website is a common destination for Counter-Strike 2 or VALORANT players who want to quantify their brain’s reflexes. But what does reaction time actually mean, and how much of an advantage does a faster mental response time give players?</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what reaction time is, what the Reaction Time test actually is grading, and what it means as a CS2 or VALORANT player.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-reaction-time">What is Reaction Time?</h2>



<p>Reaction time is defined as the amount of time it takes for an individual to recognize and respond to a visual and/or auditory stimulus. For gamers, and for players of tactical shooters like CS2 or VALORANT, reaction time is how long it takes for a player to respond to a specific visual or audio cue. This could be an enemy or grenade appearing on screen, or the sound of the bomb being planted or an ability being popped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="donk INHUMAN Reaction Flick (with pov)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKG99h5gF3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When CS2 or VALORANT players talk about “reaction time,” they’re typically referring to the time it takes a player to react (i.e. shoot) an enemy that appears on screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reaction-time-test">What is the Reaction Time test?</h2>



<p>The Reaction Time test on the Human Benchmark website is described there as a “simple tool to measure your reaction time.” It measures the milliseconds it takes for you to recognize when the red box turns green and then click. When you perform the test, you are given an average reaction time after four applications of the test.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the site, the median reaction time is 273 milliseconds, while the average is 284 ms, though input/monitor lag can play a factor. These numbers are produced from over 81 million reaction time clicks. Top esports pros score much higher though. During a recent stream, VALORANT star Tyson “TenZ’ Ngo <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1894802864910016862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casually performed the test</a> and scored 138 ms, more than twice as as fast as the test’s average.</p>



<p>The Human Benchmark website also recently added a simplified “aim trainer” game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’d find in programs like AimLabs</a>. This test is actually a better method of grading a gamer’s reaction time, since it includes moving the mouse to hit your targets. The median reaction time in the aim trainer game is 400 ms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-important-is-reaction-time-in-games-like-cs2-or-valorant">How Important is Reaction Time in Games Like CS2 or VALORANT?</h2>



<p>High reaction time is important in games like CS2 or VALORANT, but high reaction time doesn’t guarantee success. Of course, higher reaction times will help players win aiming duels or turn away from flashbangs. But fast reactions are only a small part of the skillset players need to go from casual to competitive to professional.</p>



<p>Skills like communication, coordination, emotional maturity, and the ability to read or predict enemy actions are all crucial. Without them, you’d just have players going by instinct, trying to make hero plays. A player that can react and make a play in a bad situation is great, but so is a player that can predict or avoid getting into dangerous situations altogether. If your reaction time is slow, that can be improved by training or improving diet or posture. But because it eventually falls off with age, pro players that stay around CS2 or VALORANT for a long time need to rely on more than just reaction time.</p>



<p>Do you have below or above average reaction times? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Among other things, it's rumored that the new season will take a page out of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-map-changes-in-season-2/2900-6184/" data-ref-id="2900-6184">Fortnite's playbook</a> and be an "OG" season that calls back to the game's origins, including bringing back the original Warzone map, Verdansk.</p><p>Boosting player numbers to 150 for Warzone could also be a reflection of this OG status, as the game originally had 150-player matches at launch in 2020.</p>

It has the Multi-Team Domination and Multi-Team Hotzone game modes, which act similar to traditional King of the Hill game modes. In Domination, there are four zones to conquer, while in Hotzone, there is on large one.</p><p>There are also two new game modes: Splitball and Firecracker. The former is Splitgate 2's take on the classic Capture the Flag mode while the latter is a variation of the Search and Destroy mode.</p><p>Aside from Glacier, the two other new maps are Bypass and Eden. Bypass is a vertically designed map based on a park and Eden is filled with portal walls for players to utilize.</p><p>There have also been changes to two game modes based on previous player feedback. In Team Deathmatch, rounds are extended and the kill target has been raised. In regular Hotzone, the shared progression on captures has been removed.</p><p>Splitgate 2 is a shooter inspired by Halo and Portal, with its portal-centric gameplay allowing players to transport themselves through portals making Splitgate stand out amongst its contemporaries. Be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-check-out-the-massive-new-glacier-map-in-this-exclusive-video/1100-6529713/" data-ref-id="1100-6529713">exclusive video of Multi-Team Domination on the Glacier map</a>. While the open alpha is only available on PC and current-gen consoles, the game will also come to PS4 and Xbox One sometime this year.</p>

		<p>Blades of Fire has been revealed by 505 Games and developer MercurySteam, their upcoming third person action RPG that will be launching surprisingly soon for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 22nd May 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Official Announcement Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFDarIpwXsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of smithing to be expected as you forge new weaponry to go up against a menagerie of enemies that include everything from imposingly armoured warriors, to many-handed freaks, and the more natural and mechanical.</p>
<p>There’s shades of the modern God of War to this, from the closeness of the third person camera, and it will be interesting to see how this has come together.</p>

<p>Spanish developer MercurySteam is best known in recent times for their excellent Metroid Dread, the culmination of over a decade working on a string of Castlevania games for Konami in the early 2010s, before being entrusted with a Metroid II: Samus Returns remake for 3DS.</p>
<p>Sure, Blades of Fire is going to be in a rather different genre, but looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread review</a>, I bestowed the 2D platforming sequel a fantastic 9/10, concluding:</p>
<p>“Metroid Dread sees the galaxy’s best bounty hunter return in fine form. It takes the terror of being hunted from Metroid Fusion, the more modern direction of Samus Returns, and the freedom to add to the series’ decades of lore to create something that’s nigh on essential for Metroid fans.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now.1120992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-572-60-fix-black-screen-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a new GeForce Game Ready driver</a> optimized for the latest NARAKA: BLADEPOINT update. The highly popular melee focused free-to-play Battle Royale game by 24 Entertainment now supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, allowing players to achieve astounding frame rates on the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>
<p>Leading the pack is the flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. According to NVIDIA benchmarks, it can run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at an average of nearly 600 frames per second (yes, you've read that right) at 4K resolution and maximum graphics settings with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. That's a massive uplift compared to the admittedly still more than sufficient 150 frames per second that the card can achieve without DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The GeForce RTX 5080 achieves only a little more than half the average frame rate of its bigger sibling, 312 frames per second. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is fairly close at 255 average frames per second. At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen lets GeForce RTX 50 owners run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at even more mind-boggling frame rates: 737, 536, and 450 FPS at 1440P and 933, 727, and 642 FPS at 1080P.</p>
<p>The latest game update also optimizes character grappling hook resources to provide a smoother experience when using it. In-game 'loot memory' was also optimized, improving memory recovery after combat to reduce memory consumption. Content-wise, 24 Entertainment added a new hero called Ziping Yin to the Showdown mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgrJieiIZg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA also revealed that the new DLSS 4 plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to game developers, allowing them to access the latest and greatest transformer models for optimal image quality.</p>
<p>As a roundup of the latest PC game releases with integrated DLSS technologies, the racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is out with support for Frame Generation and Super Resolution, while the roguelite first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287150/Revenge_of_the_Mage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenge of the Mage</a> launched last month in early access with Super Resolution support.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will debut with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and ray-traced reflections; on the same day, PGA TOUR 2K25 will be released with DLSS Super Resolution.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-pushes-ahead-with-ai-in-gaming.1120989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft might say its top priority right now is security, but it’s been clear for months that AI is just as important. The odd division out has been Xbox, which hasn’t discussed its use of AI much in public. But that changed last week when Microsoft ripped the band-aid off and waded, somewhat clumsily, into the debate over AI in gaming.</p><p>Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">Muse</a>, its new AI model that can generate gameplay. It was trained on Ninja Theory’s Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, and it can understand a 3D world and physics and then respond to players’ interactions. While Muse is a Microsoft Research project at heart, Microsoft presented it in a way that linked it directly to Xbox and the future of the company’s gaming efforts. That has divided opinion between those who argue that Microsoft will use this model to build games and lay off developers, and others who think this is still very early and simply another tool in a game developer’s kit.</p><p>I’ve been speaking to game developers over the past week to get a better understanding of the response to Muse. Of the handful I’ve spoken to, no one is willing to speak on the record for reasons like career concerns and the potential impact speaking out might have on game deals with Xbox. Most echo what <strong>David Goldfarb</strong>, developer and founder of The Outsiders, <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1892273449784967438">posted on X</a> last week, “Fuck this shit.”</p><p>Goldfarb expanded on that brief response in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/">interview with <em>Wired</em></a>. “When we rely on this stuff we are implicitly empowering a class of people who own these tools and don’t give a fuck about how they reshape our lives,” he said.</p><p>That’s a concern I’ve heard from multiple game developers: if they accept these AI tools then what happens next? There’s a growing fear in the game industry right now that AI will replace human creators, and it’s not a baseless fear, either. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them. In an industry that’s already struggling with costs and layoffs, the anxiety over AI replacing jobs is high.</p><p>Some developers are hoping that models like Muse will be limited to the early stages of game development, where you could use an AI model to create some rough gameplay instead of sketching out ideas and concepts. Given how nascent Muse is, that seems like a reasonable assumption right now, but as models get more capable over time, where do the lines blur?</p><p>Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> described Muse as a “massive moment of wow” in a recent <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella">podcast</a>. “We’re going to have a catalog of games soon that we will start using these models, or we’re going to train these models to generate, and then start playing them,” he said.</p><p>Microsoft is getting ready to release at least one AI-generated game on Copilot Labs, the company’s test bed for AI that requires a monthly $20 subscription to Copilot Pro. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s AI research work tell me the company has also been experimenting with several minigames that are best described as AI-infused. The games, developed by Microsoft Research, use generative models and both human writers and reviewers to create stories and illustrations. One of the minigames, <em>Rushes</em>, lets players select storylines and make choices that influence the AI-driven narrative.</p><p>I’m not expecting Microsoft to release these minigames, as they’re designed as research projects on how AI models and humans interact in game design, but the company could always highlight them in the future. Microsoft chose to demonstrate its Muse model running in real time during an employee-only town hall earlier this week, instead of these minigames. </p><p>The work between Microsoft Research and Xbox on minigames and models like Muse are just the beginning of Microsoft’s AI in gaming efforts. At GDC next month, Microsoft is planning to highlight more ways it’s using AI in gaming. In one session, <strong>Fatima Kardar</strong>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft, <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-future-of-gaming-supported-by-ai-how-xbox-is-empowering-players-and-creators-presented-by-microsoft/911783">will discuss</a> “how Xbox is using AI to unlock new opportunities across the Xbox ecosystem for both players and game creators.” Another session <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ai-innovation-for-game-experiences-from-research-to-prototyping-presented-by-microsoft/911349">will demonstrate</a> how game developers and researchers at Microsoft are experimenting with new AI tools for gaming.</p><p>While many of Microsoft’s AI sessions at GDC will be future-looking, there are a couple from Blizzard that will detail how <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/machine-learning-summit-fitting-armor-assets-in-world-of-warcraft-with-deep-learning/908208">use AI models</a> to automate 3D armor fitting or how developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/amplifying-player-voices-with-llms-in-game-development/907458">parse through player feedback</a> using large language models. These show off the potential for AI tools to assist developers rather than replace them, so they’re likely to be far less controversial than an AI model that generates gameplay.</p><p>Microsoft says it’s now leaving it up to its own game studios to decide on how AI is used across their games. “We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” said Ninja Theory studio head <strong>Dom Matthews</strong>, in a video accompanying Microsoft’s Muse announcement last week. Just days later though, Microsoft-owned Activision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618822/activision-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ai-generated-content">forced to confirm</a> that <em>Call of Duty </em>uses AI-generated content. The confirmation came months after fans noticed a zombie Santa with six fingers in a loading screen in <em>Black Ops 6</em> over the holidays, alongside weapon decals and player cards that seemed to be AI generated.</p><p>How Microsoft’s other Xbox game studios react to its push for AI in gaming is going to be something to keep an eye on throughout 2025, especially when developers outside of Xbox have <a href="https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-director-criticizes-ai/">loudly criticized</a> AI use in game development, with one indie developer creating a <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal">“No Gen AI” seal</a> that developers can use on their game’s store page. There might be growing pushback against AI in gaming from developers and players, but I don’t think it will be long until other Xbox game studios make the decision to use AI tools or AI-generated content. By unveiling Muse last week, Microsoft has made clear it wants its studios to be at the very forefront of AI in gaming, regardless of the pushback.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is testing free Office for Windows apps with ads. </strong>Surprisingly, Microsoft has quietly started allowing some countries to install a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618278/microsoft-office-free-windows-apps-ad-supported-version">free version of Office for Windows that includes ads</a>. Microsoft has confirmed it’s just a test for now, but it’s a pretty big test to overhaul how Office is distributed in certain countries. The ad-supported version of Office includes banners that are permanently visible at the side, as well as 15-second video ads that play every few hours. Given this appears to be largely limited to India, I suspect Microsoft is looking at ways it can tempt people into paying for Office instead of pirating it. Microsoft’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/microsoft-tests-show-91-new-pcs-from-india-loaded-with-pirated-software/articleshow/66475487.cms?from=mdr">own tests in 2018</a> showed that 91 percent of new PCs in India came loaded with pirated software.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft launches next-gen Phi AI models</strong>. While we await OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 model, Microsoft made a smaller AI model announcement of its own this week. Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini are <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/aiplatformblog/introducing-phi-4-microsoft%E2%80%99s-newest-small-language-model-specializing-in-comple/4357090">Microsoft’s latest small language models</a>, and both are now available on Azure AI Foundry and Hugging Face. Both can be used by developers on smartphones, PCs, and cars, and Phi-4-multimodal improves speech recognition, translation, summarization, audio understanding, and image analysis.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox’s new <em>Fable</em> game is delayed to 2026. </strong>Rumors have been circulating that <em>Fable </em>might not make its 2025 release window, and Microsoft confirmed this week that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">being pushed to 2026</a>. Given how busy 2025 is looking for Xbox games, I’m not surprised <em>Fable</em> has been given more time here. The question now is whether Microsoft is still targeting a 2025 release for <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, like I’d heard last year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft makes Copilot Voice and Think Deeper free with unlimited use. </strong>Microsoft made OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model free for all Copilot users last month, and now it’s providing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619199/microsoft-copilot-free-unlimited-voice-think-deeper-open-ai-o1-reasoning-model-ai">unlimited use of this model and Copilot’s voice capabilities</a> to everyone this week. I think we’re going to see a lot more Copilot announcements in the coming months, and I’ve heard multiple times from sources recently that Microsoft is very focused on increasing AI usage by reducing the barriers to entry and the costs involved.</span></li><li><span><strong>You’ll need more Microsoft Rewards points to pay for Game Pass soon</strong>. Microsoft is bumping the amount of points it takes to get Game Pass through its Rewards program. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/02/microsoft-rewards-appears-to-be-increasing-its-prices-for-xbox-game-pass">It now costs</a> level two members 17,000 (previously 12,000) points for a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, with PC Game Pass jumping to 10,500 points (previously, 7,500).</span></li><li><span><strong>Scientists question Microsoft’s claims of a quantum computing breakthrough</strong>. Microsoft was quick to claim it had reached a milestone breakthrough in quantum computing last week, unveiling its Majorana 1 chip. Now, the physics community <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/617792/microsofts-quantum-quandary">has a lot of questions</a> about Microsoft’s paper, which the company is promising to address at the APS meeting in March.</span></li><li><span><strong>Indiana Jones now has DLSS 4 support</strong>. Bethesda updated <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> with DLSS 4, Multi Frame Generation, and even FSR 3.1 Frame Gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616975/indiana-jones-dlss-4-fsr-frame-gen-support">support last week</a>. That’s great news for PC players, and we’re now waiting to hear if <em>Indiana Jones </em>is going to make Microsoft’s target of an April release on PS5.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft completes EU sovereign cloud project</strong>. Microsoft has finalized its multiyear project to allow its European commercial and public sector customers to store and process their data within European Union countries. “This milestone is the culmination of a massive, multiyear engineering effort across hundreds of Microsoft product teams and thousands of developers around the globe,” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/26/microsoft-completes-landmark-eu-data-boundary-offering-enhanced-data-residency-and-transparency/">says Microsoft</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft pauses the rollout of its redesigned Windows 11 battery indicator</strong>. Microsoft started rolling out an improved battery indicator to Windows 11 PCs last week, hitting the Release Preview ring before a broader rollout. Just days later, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3321-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Microsoft paused it</a> “to address some issues.” It’s not clear exactly what those issues are, but Microsoft says it plans to “begin rolling it out in a future update soon.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft has reportedly dropped some AI data center leases</strong>. Microsoft has committed to spending $80 billion this fiscal year on AI data centers, but there are signs it might be wavering on that commitment. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/microsoft-cancels-leases-for-ai-data-centers-analyst-says"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a> that US brokerage TD Cowen warned that Microsoft has pulled back on some leases for US data center capacity. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report directly, and one analyst has suggested this could be just “business as usual” with Microsoft free to “move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft calls on the Trump administration to ‘avoid a strategic misstep in the AI global race.’ </strong>Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/27/trump-administration-ai-global-race/">penned an open letter</a> to the Trump administration, asking it to change the Biden administration’s interim AI diffusion rule that caps the export of US AI components. Smith argues that the rule will “give China a strategic advantage” in the AI race, and could prevent US allies and partners from accessing AI infrastructure and services from Microsoft and other US tech companies.</span></li></ul></div><p>What do you think about Microsoft’s big push for AI in gaming?

            <p>EA have restored and released the full source code for several antique Command &amp; Conquer games under the GPL license, in a red letter day for series modders. The games in question are the original Command &amp; Conquer (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-red-alert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-generals">Command &amp; Conquer Generals</a>, plus the latter's Zero Hour expansion. That's a lot of refurbishable strategy game to get your head around.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this is reportedly the result of EA commissioning one particular modder, community figure Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, to restore the old C&amp;C source codes, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/1izmml4/cc_steam_workshop_support_source_code/">described at fearful length on Reddit</a>. If you're not familiar with him, he was involved in bringing the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection to Steam back in March 2024. RPS Tank Driver-For-Hire Steve Hogarty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/command-conquer-remastered-collection-review">called that</a> "the treatment these genre-defining games deserve".</p>
<p>You can find the source code for Tiberian Dawn <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn">on this Github page</a>. The Red Alert code is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert">over here</a>, while Renegade is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Renegade">here</a>, and Generals/Zero Hour is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour">thisaway</a>.</p>
<p>They're also throwing custom mapmakers a bag of bones by adding Steam Workshop support for Renegade, Generals, and Zero Hour, together with Command &amp; Conquer Tiberium Wars, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3 - plus the Uprising expansion - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-4">Command &amp; Conquer 4</a> Tiberian Twilight. All of the mission editor and world builder tools for these games have been updated so you can publish maps directly to the Workshop.</p>
<p>"When you subscribe to an item on the Steam Workshop (via the Client or webpage), the games will now pull that content down when you next launch the game and the maps will be displayed in the singleplayer/multiplayer map selection menus," explains Feenan in the Reddit post.</p>
<p>Finally, EA have released a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Modding_Support">C&amp;C Modding Support pack</a>, containing the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use original series developer Westwood's old SAGE engine.</p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> finally so close you can almost smell it (sweat, damp cat, and a lingering whiff of dung bomb, would be my guess), Capcom has teased more of what's coming in its first post-launch content update, now confirmed to be launching in "early April".
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Capcom has discussed Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1, of course; earlier this month, it revealed everyone's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune would be the first post-launch monster joining Wilds. But now, on the eve of the game's release, it's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236">additionally teased a "new level of challenge"</a>, that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game.
</p>
<p>
Its announcement also alluded to "another challenging monster", but it's unclear if this is a reference to Mizutsune or a third new monster. Either way - as I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">noted in my review this week</a> - Wilds' difficulty feels like it skews a little low at the moment, even where Tempered monsters are involved, so it'll be nice get something a little tougher to tackle so early into its lifespan.

<p>
And there's more. Capcom has <em>also</em> teased a "new place to gather" for hunters who've completed the main story, providing somewhere for friends to "meet, communicate, have meals together, and more". And by more, I assume it means arm wrestle. Currently, Wilds doesn't have a centralised gathering hub in the same way previous Monster Hunters games did, so the addition should create a welcome social focal point for players. And hopefully we'll get some seasonal decor to admire once the post-launch quests start rolling in.
</p>
<p>
But before Title Update 1's "early April" release, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-monster-hunter-wilds-physical-release-requires-a-day-one-update-but-digital-buyers-can-get-a-head-start">set to receive a 15GB day one update</a> - although Capcom hasn't yet detailed what it'll include. Hopefully, it'll address the technical rough spots evident in the pre-launch version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-feels-undercooked-on-ps5-series-x-and-especially-series-s">Digital Foundry called "undercooked" on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-plays-better-on-ps5-pro">the PS5 Pro version fares better</a>.

Plus series veterans have been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same difficulty debate plenty of times before</a></span>. </p><p>I’m still cleaning up the last of the side quests in the base game and have found myself occasionally getting demolished by a particularly challenging foe like a Tempered Jin Dahaad (it was also late at night and I was starting to fall asleep, which might have been a part of it). And even when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t making me sweat, every moment has still been a joy. </p><p>It’s a pretty frictionless experience so far, yes, but also still an incredibly robust, refined, and meaty version of the <em>Monster Hunter </em>experience. It’s easy to see it only getting better with time. A month after launch for the first new bosses might be a long wait for some, but it gives the average player plenty of time to get through everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently has to show them, which is a lot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Streaming platform Twitch has announced a big change to its monetization policy, as "most streamers" will soon gain access to the site's monetization tools. Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners could access these revenue-generating tool, but these will be available to more creators later in 2025.</p><p>"We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you're just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while," Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We're excited to open up monetization tools--subscriptions and bits--to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage. We're also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch."</p><p>Previously, earning a Twitch partnership required a user to have 50 followers, an average of three viewers per stream, and at least eight hours of cumulative streaming across at least seven different days. That process could be daunting for new streamers given the competitive nature of Twitch, but it was generally achievable if a person was consistent with their efforts.</p><p>Beyond this big change, Clancy also explained other plans for Twitch in 2025. The company is working on features to help partners earn more money while collaborating, both landscape and vertical video through enhanced broadcasting tools will be added to improve the mobile viewing experience, and the tools to edit clips will also be improved. These updates come shortly after <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1892277199497043994" rel="nofollow ">Twitch announced that it'll be implementing a 100-hour storage cap</a> on highlights and uploads starting April 19, a move that has not gone over well with a large part of its userbase.</p><p>While the company cites a need to save on storage costs and video highlights not being as popular as it envisioned as reasons behind the move, users have noted that Twitch's parent company Amazon is one of the biggest names in cloud storage, leading to criticism of the cost-cutting measure.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the biggest sports game ever in the US according to Circana, and it seems that the publisher is considering bringing back its take on college basketball, which has been dormant for more than a decade. In a recent report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports senior vice president Daryl Holt said that college basketball (and other sports) remain a possibility, but reiterated that American football is still the publisher's main priority.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a clear need, want, desire from our community and the faithful were there [for college football]," Holt said. “As developers, we try to figure out how we can get creative on reaching other aspects of sports, whether that be a smaller sport or one that doesn't have a game. But right now, my focus has been on American football. We'll keep looking for those things, but as a developer and working in sports, you're always tapping your head going, what else could be possible?”</p><p dir="ltr">The last EA Sports-published NCAA basketball game, NCAA Basketball 10, came out in 2009 and featured the now-retired dunk contest champ Blake Griffin as the cover athlete. While any plans for a new college basketball game remain quite nascent, it's likely that EA would try to get as many student athletes as possible to sign to a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal. More than 11,000 FBS football players opted into CFB 25's deal last year, receiving $600 and a copy of the game as compensation for their NIL rights. The NIL deal for CFB 26 is reportedly still being negotiated, though EA declined to comment on those plans. The CFB series itself lay dormant for more than a decade, the last release coming in 2012 before last year's revival restored its fortunes.</p><p dir="ltr">Holt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-new-college-football-26-features/1100-6529751/">teased new features</a> coming to this year's sequel, CFB 26, including possible improvements to the single-player career mode Road to Glory. CFB 25 was the second-best selling game of 2024 in the US, second only to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/psvr-2-gets-a-big-permanent-price-cut/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced a big price cut for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a>, dropping the recommended retail price of the of the VR headset starting in March.</p>
<p>The same two SKUs for PSVR 2 will still be on offer – a base edition that includes the PSVR 2 headset, PSVR 2 Sense controllers and some earbuds, and a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle that adds a digital download code for the game – and they will now have the exact same price.</p>


<p>The new RRP for PSVR will be $399.99 (pre-tax) / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty significant drop of $150 / €150 / £130 for the standard set, and $200 / €200 / £170 for the game bundle – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/psvr-2-price-cut-by-a-whopping-200-180-for-a-limited-time/">this matches the promotions from last summer</a>, as they were gearing up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the release of the PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps indicative of where PSVR 2 is as a product. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch have all gone without any price cuts since the start of this generation. In fact, they’ve actually become more expensive over time, even when shrunken down, simplified versions of these consoles have launched,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/"> like with the PS5 Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the PSVR 2 PC adapter last year, dropping the price permanently could spur on some sales, with speculation and insider whispers that Sony has struggled to shift the hardware – there’s also been rumours that Apple might like to co-opt the Sense controllers for Apple Vision Pro compatibility, though these are not sold separately and any plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Sony has noted that recent updates for PSVR 2 have added low-latency hand tracking, which lets you put the controllers down and play using your hands and fingers, the PSVR 2 headset mapping out their positions using the tracking cameras ordinarily used for following the Sense controllers. This is supported with the recently updated Waltz of the Wizard:</p>
<p><iframe title="Waltz of the Wizard - Hand Tracking Update Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXtR7_4IdaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All in all, this could make PSVR 2 a shade more appealing – it not longer quite costs more than a PS5 (with disc drive), for example – and the PC VR support is excellent, opening up broader access to VR gaming and with the reassuring longevity that PC gaming provides.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/metro-developer-4a-games-ukraine-rebrands-as-reburn-why-how-and-does-4a-games-still-exist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Independent developer 4A Games Ukraine has rebranded as Reburn and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/la-quimera-is-a-new-sci-fi-shooter-from-the-metro-devs-and-nicolas-winding-refn/">announced their new sci-fi IP La Quimera</a>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they’ve done this, and how, when 4A Games and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro">Metro</a> series are both owned by Embracer Group. Well, it’s because what has generally been referred to as 4A Games is actually two companies: 4A Games Malta which is owned by Embracer, and 4A Games Ukraine (now Reburn), which is independent.</p>


<p>It makes absolute sense that, now that they are launching a new IP, Reburn needs to stake out a new identity for itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for confusion here, and there is still some fuzzy grey areas in the understanding of the timelines and the financial transactions that took place over the past decade. We’ll seek to clear this up through this article.</p>

<p>In essence, 4A Games was founded in 2006 by a core group of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> developers striking out from GSC Game Worlds. In 2014, with the first wave of the Russian-backed uprisings in Eastern Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, some of the team, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/4a-games-opens-new-malta-studio">including creative director and co-founder Andrew Prokhorov and CTO Oles Shyshkovtsov</a>, left the country and set up a new studio in Malta – 4A Games Malta. Both studios could use the 4A Games trademark, share the 4A Engine, and develop <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> together. In public statements, the Malta studio was referred to as the headquarters for 4A Games, with the Kyiv studio</p>
<p>Where things get muddled is in August 2020. At that time, Embracer (who already held the Metro IP via Koch Media) acquired “4A Games”, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games/">announcing in the press release</a> that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> would be the new parent company for the 150+ members “across two studios in Malta and Ukraine”. Despite the last two years of instability for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a>, “4A Games” and the Metro IP are still held by the company.</p>
<p>However, the timeline according to Reburn is that Embracer only acquired 4A Games Malta in 2020. Separately in the same year, 4A Games Ukraine received additional investment and started work on their new IP La Quimera. At a later date, and to prevent future confusion, they have decided to leave the 4A Games trademark with the Malta-based studio and rebrand as Reburn.</p>
<p>It’s a quietly remarkable story for how unremarkable it actually is, outside of scratching our heads how Embracer didn’t actually acquire the Ukraine studio. There’s no big wave of layoffs, no exodus of developers, and both studios can proudly share their legacy of working on the Metro series. This is perhaps conceptually similar to how Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin created <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/10/08/dishonored-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Dishonored</a> together and then started working on separate projects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, both Reburn and 4A Games will be able to use the 4A Engine. While Reburn has now announced La Quimera, 4A Malta’s next game is still under wraps – the most recent game in the Metro series was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro: Awakening VR</a>, developed and self-published by Vertigo Games, and we know that a new Metro is in the works.</p>
