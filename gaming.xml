<p>Wildgate developer Moonshoot is the latest video game developer to confirm layoffs, as announced by its parent company, Dreamhaven. </p>



<p>The undisclosed number of layoffs comes after the sci-fi shooter struggled in the month following its July 2025 release. </p>

<p>In a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/moonshot-games-making-layoffs-after-wildgate-struggles-to-become-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Dreamhaven stated that despite Wildgate launching on the Epic Games Store at the start of 2026 and seeing a boost in playership, Dreamhaven was forced to make a difficult decision in an effort to ensure it could continue updating the game and work on ways to support the studio long-term. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Despite the increase in player numbers and overall positive reception, it wasn’t enough to sustain the size of our development team. So we made the difficult decision to reduce team roles to ensure we can continue delivering updates to the game while working in a way that supports the studio in the long term. We remain focused on Wildgate’s next content update, which introduces more quality of life improvements, including the highly-requested progression system, which we anticipate coming later this quarter.” </p>
</blockquote>







<p>Dreamhaven also had to make cutbacks in September 2025; at that time, they largely affected the publishing team. A month earlier, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhavens-wildgate-has-struggled-with-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that the game had only sold $130,000 unit; now, it is free to play on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, layoffs in the gaming industry are common right now. Ubisoft recently announced a massive restructuring. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>No, there is no dog companion in the upcoming Fable reboot. Yes, there are those in the development team who are upset about it as well.</p>



<p>In Fable 2 and Fable 3, one of the player-favorite features of the game was the dog companion. However, the series is now being rebooted by Playground Games, and unfortunately there’s no dog companion. There will be horses, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-playground-founder-explains-why-he-nixed-dog-companions-in-fable">Playground founder explains why he nixed dog companions in Fable</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Ralph Fulton of Playground Games noted that he was the one who made the decision to cut the dog companions, he cited “development reasons” as the cause, and noted that there were members of his team that have yet to forgive him for making the decision.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don’t need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Despite the lack of a canine by your side, Fable will retain the freedom and Britishness of the original series. Learn more about the origins of the reboot at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Text-based games, management RPGs, and visual novels – of whatever kind – rarely make the most exciting previews. It's just not easy to build a rich interest in the world and characters of a story you can only get the slightest taste of. I'm very pleased to say that a few hours with Sovereign Tower broke that trend entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whosoever turns the key in the giant magic lock on the tower becomes king. So, as the mystically-appointed lord of the tower, your poor faceless wanderer becomes a very important person overnight in what developer Wild Wits calls a "story-rich, Round Table management RPG." It's an entertaining concept that draws its characters and dialogue equally from fantastical tradition and modern life. Couple that with a deliciously detailed art style and a sense of what's most entertaining to do in both management games and visual novels. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's enough to sell it, I think, but it also has some nice surprises and a weird little twist on the genre as a whole. I had a pretty darn good time with it, and I'm looking forward to more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">King of the Castle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In each turn of Sovereign Tower, you have to do two things: accept audiences, then assign knights from your round table to various quests. Taking audiences is a simple concept: Sit on the throne and deal with problems people bring you. The decisions you make there can alter the path of the story, bring up new quests for your knights, or avoid problems. They'll also affect the sovereign's standing with the realm's four factions: the Nobility, People, Merchants, and Scholars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some problems go away if you just throw money at  them, and the taxes you get at the start of every cycle can pay for some of that—but those are the same taxes you use to pay for stuff like cool new swords and horses and magic potions, so do you really want to spend them on boring stuff like bridges or whatever? Probably not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sovereign Tower Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty normal, but it's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable. I encountered a stinky jester, proud emissaries unable to admit they couldn't solve their own problems, clever peasants, annoying nobles, and even an assassin. Talking with them solidifies the personality of your blank-slate Sovereign, raising their stats in Audacity, Tyranny, Wisdom, and Kindness to unlock alternate decisions in future events.</p><p>It's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Knights are the flavor that'll really have to carry the game, and from what I saw they might do it. I met a huge guy that acted like a child, a very fancy boy, an extremely overdramatic guy, a nice lady who loved forest critters, the most goth knight ever, and even a straight-up actual wolf. Each of them had their own unique little events and dialogue that popped up from time to time, each of which affected your sovereign's relationship with them. They also had history to learn, as well as more straightforward stats, all of which affect their performance on missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-08-1769118770111.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Figuring out which knight would be best for each quest was an actually interesting choice. Equipment like a specific horse to ride, a sword to use, or a magic potion can give them temporary stat boosts, but it's often the bonuses or penalties from their personality traits that make the difference between a failure and success or between mere success and an outstanding victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example if you're doing something that's a bit of public relations? Probably should send the more charismatic knight, but not the really arrogant one. Watching each knight's background and figuring out which of the little highlighted keywords apply to the current mission is a fun bit of understanding the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's a real penalty for failure. Your knights each have an armor score, which if it goes to zero means that knight's, well, dead and gone. Your blacksmith can only fix one knight's armor each cycle—so you need to be reasonably sure that the task you're sending a knight on is one they can at least survive if they fail.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shining Armor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the characters, nor the entire game as I saw it, would have nearly as much personality without the visual art on display in Sovereign Tower, and I've got to take a moment to run through the influences and elements that make it up. Starting with the simple choices of colors to draw from: The warm pastels, earth tones, and jewel tones are lovely, then they're combined with copious golden shades and tints to express lighting. It's a palette of colors that's something between stained glass or rich watercolor on thick paper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-14-1769118784850.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits. You can feel the shrug in how Urusla stands, for example. You can see the carefree attitude in the angle of Angelica's head. And, well, everything about Gideon tells you exactly who he is and how he behaves. It's not just great illustration work in that you can feel the motion, it's that you can immediately start to feel who the characters are just from how they look.</p><p>The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear that these are artists who understand how to work their chosen medium, and if you'll put up with me for a nerd moment, it is deeply reminiscent of the Art Nouveau period in design from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Particularly the advertisements, posters, and calendars of justly-famous artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alphonse Mucha</u></a>. It's a fitting choice, too: Mucha's work often used the kind of medieval romantic and even fairytale themes that Sovereign Tower seems to use in its stories—I imagine he'd approve of being the inspiration here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-03-1769118800769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that's where I'd place this whole game's artistic style, too: It's a blend of medieval fantasy and Arthurian romance setting, the art of Mucha, and the writing of a wryly clever modern comic book. There's basically nothing to dislike in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clever Twist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a surprise to people who like this kind of game that there are going to be secret events and pathways through the story to uncover, as well as desperate outcomes and painful prices to pay when choosing poorly at certain decision points. I found that Sovereign Tower must have more than a few, since I managed to stumble into at least two hidden story outcomes while playing just by assigning an unexpected or suboptimal knight to a specific quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustration with these kinds of events, however, is that they can give you unwanted outcomes or change the story when you weren't expecting them to or were aiming for another outcome. The only choice you've got at that point is often to play the entire visual novel over again just to see a new path or the immediate consequence of a tough choice.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-02-1769118819660.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The real good choice that Sovereign Tower makes is to have a built-in do-over mechanic. See, there's a demon that lives in a cage in the tower basement, which I'm sure isn't scary or plot-relevant at all because the demon helps you do something very useful: Step back in time. Don't worry—the demon assures me this is because it has absolutely no bad intentions and is bound to help you—much like all the other magical things that live in the tower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demon's help you can turn back time, especially when some choice you've made would lead to a disastrous end. I expect you'll also be able to use the power to avoid the worst ends in the game, and I'm betting most players will want to use it at least once or twice to avoid making whatever NPC they've chosen to romance not mad at them about something. There's also the hint, given in the trailer and screenshots for Sovereign Tower, that you'll be able to use the demon's power to unlock alternate dialogue in situations you've seen before—tagged with an "Omniscience" stat that surely won't upset or alarm people who don't realize you're time travelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, from the art and the writing, I'm pretty intrigued by Sovereign Tower and it's going on my list of games to watch out for. Sure, the game mechanics are pretty simple, but when the story and characters are interesting in this way I'm glad the game rules are getting out of the way to let me entertain myself—failing and succeeding on my own terms.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-is-finally-stealing-the-show-for-micros-1848034238">It’s almost time to leave behind <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>‘s Mexico</a> and journey to a brand new country. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-location-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-2000628658"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> moves the series to Japan</a>, and it looks amazing! The new entry in Xbox’s popular car sim series arrives later this year, and we have all the useful info you might want to know about the upcoming open-world racer. Just put your seatbelt on first before speed-scrolling through this list.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is the next installment in the <em>Forza</em> <em>Horizon </em>franchise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">Unlike the more serious, sim-heavy <em>Motorsport</em> games,</a> the <em>Horizon</em> titles are open-world racing games focused more on over-the-top moments, music, gorgeous locations, and arcade-y fun. This time around, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> brings the franchise to Japan, a location fans have been wanting for years. You’ll be able to explore the urban streets of Tokyo, the suburbs outside of the town, and plenty of open land and rural spaces far away from the city. And like in past games, you can choose to focus on big races to level up and unlock more challenges, or you can just chill, cruise, and jam out to music.</p>

 <h2>What’s different about this latest entry?</h2> <p>Beyond the new location, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is shaking things up and swapping out the main character. In <em>Horizon 6</em>, you won’t be playing as the “superstar” racer featured in the last few games. Instead, you’re a tourist visiting Japan who gets involved in the Horizon Festival and all the racing and car culture. That means you have to earn entry to the festival and its activities and slowly work your way up from driving rust buckets to supercars.</p>  <h2>How big is the map in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>?</h2> <p>Very big! In fact, this is the biggest map that Playground Games has created for a <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> art director Don Arceta claimed in an interview</a> that <em>Horizon 6</em>‘s digital Japan is the biggest map in the history of the series, and Tokyo is the largest city the team has ever built. And as you explore this massive location, you’ll fill up a journal, a new feature in <em>Horizon 6</em> that helps you track everything you do and all the places you visit while playing the game.</p>

 <h2>How many cars are available at launch?</h2> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">According to<em> Xbox Wire,</em> there will be around 550 cars</a> to collect and drive in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> at launch. That number will go up over time as the devs add more cars to the game. As for the car on the cover of the game, that’s the Toyota 2025 GR GT Prototype.</p>

 <h2>Can I play <em>Horizon 6</em> online with my friends?</h2> <p>Yup! Like earlier games in the series, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> supports multiplayer with friends as well as random players. And new to this entry, players will be able to build new tracks together with their friends. There will also be car meets you can hang out at with friends, and a location that lets players build their own personal home and race track. These are both new features for <em>Horizon 6</em>.</p> <h2>What is <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s release date?</h2> <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is launching on May 19 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, and&nbsp;will be available day one on Game Pass Ultimate. Xbox is also holding the game hostage, like so many publishers. If you spend extra on the Premium Edition, you’ll be able to play <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> four days early, on May 15.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> be available on PS5?</h2> <p>Yes, but not at launch. Playground has confirmed that it is working on a PS5 port of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, but it won’t be available until sometime later in 2026.</p> <h2>Wait, where are the goblins and magic and swords?</h2> <p>Ohhh, you’re looking for Playground’s other open-world game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable</em>, which is also launching this year. Sorry to have wasted your time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playground Games’ Ralph Fulton spoke about the origins of Fable’s return and ensuring the game kept the core spirit of the original series, which debuted a quarter of a century ago.</p>



<p>Fable has returned for the first time since 2018 and is set to release its first mainline game in the franchise in over a decade since Fable 3 in 2010. With Playground Games currently at the helm of the franchise, Fulton can now reflect on how the success of Forza Horizon 3 and the desire to grow as Developers sowed the seeds for Fable’s return. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Fulton expanded on what he thinks led to this opportunity for the team of developers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that as a developer, you should always be trying to challenge yourself and expand your skill set. So, that’s where the idea came from. And obviously because we’d been working with Xbox for really since our inception as Playground Games, we had great relationships with them. We knew a lot of people there. The obvious first conversation for us was with them where we said, “Hey, look, we’re looking to build a second team. We want to work in a new genre.” We felt like the transferable skills that we had from the Horizon games were an open world. We had learned a lot about building open worlds technically in terms of streaming, in terms of game design and game flow and all that good stuff. And in lots of ways that are maybe surprisingly car-agnostic. There’s a ton of things about Horizon games that are about the cars, but there’s a ton of principles that we’d learned there, which we felt were transferable. And I don’t remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, “That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.” It’s a series that we adored here and still do.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-playground-wanted-to-make-sure-fable-maintained-its-core-elements-including-its-britishness">Playground Wanted to Make Sure Fable Maintained Its Core Elements, Including Its Britishness</h2>



<p>When rebooting such a beloved franchise from the ground up, the team at Playground wanted to ensure certain core elements remained intact. Ralph Fulton says the three pillars of Fable games they landed on were “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness.” For developers, these three pillars formed the core of Fable’s DNA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually wrap that up into the word “freedom” because it’s about the freedom to choose, the freedom to make the choices and then have to live with the consequences of your choices. It’s the freedom to go where you want, do what you want, be the hero you want to be. And that right there is at the heart of our game. We want you to be the hero you want to be. So, freedom is absolutely central to it.</p>



<p>We landed on two other tonal pillars, I think. And the first is fairytale. And we actually inherited this from Lionhead. We had this treasure trove of documents which had been in storage, that came originally from Lionhead. And one of them had this incredibly neat little bit of direction, which was Fable is a fairytale, not fantasy, which I just think is brilliant, incredibly incisive and speaks to really tonally what Fable is…</p>



<p>Finally, it’s about Britishness. And again, why was it important to Xbox that a British studio continued with Fable? Because Fable is this quintessentially British game, and not just because Albion is medieval Britain through a filter, if you like. And not just because the characters are British and have British accents. There’s a sensibility to the games, there’s a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things, a way of reacting to things. It’s very British. And those things combined are for us the DNA of Fable. If you don’t hit those things, if you’re not true to those things, you’re not making a Fable game. So, that was something that we decided right at the start.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>For the first time ever, Fable has the freedom to release on PlayStation, and the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 on the same day it’s released on Xbox platforms.

      <p>The Congressional Labor Caucus, with support from the Communications Workers of America, on Thursday released a <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter</a> to the Federal Trade Commission requesting a review of the $55 billion <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone/" rel="noreferrer">sale</a> of Electronic Arts to a group of investors made up of Silver Lake, Affinity, and (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/saudi-plans-for-video-game-hub-grow-with-55-billion-ea-deal?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">primarily</a>) Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The Caucus expressed concern over the proposed deal's potential effect on workers and on competition within the games industry.</p><p>The letter, signed by <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">46 House Democrats</a>, "urge[s] the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes."</p><p>The Caucus takes issue with several parts of the deal. One is that, given that "EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States," the company has outsized power over game workers' jobs and pay. Noting that "EA has eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023, contributing to an industry-wide total of over 35,000 layoffs since 2022," the letter highlights the $20 billion in debt that's set to finance the deal, which could lead to further layoffs as EA seeks to cut costs. It also raises the possibility of "offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures," all of which "not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor markets" in the games industry.</p><p>The Caucus also notes that the deal would bring EA under the same ownership as "sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools," writing that</p><blockquote>For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses. This level of cross-ownership presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports-related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</blockquote><p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cwa-calls-on-ftc-and-cfius-to-scrutinize-ea-buyout-and-protect-workers-consumers-and-the-future-of-the-game-industry?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">October</a>, the president of the CWA sent a similar letter to the FTC and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, urging the organizations to review the deal. The <a href="https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/20251028_cwa_letter_to_secretary_bessent.pdf?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">letter to CFIUS</a> also raised concerns about "critical national security risks due to EA’s (1) access to and collection of sensitive personal data from millions of American consumers and (2) current and planned development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology."</p><p>The deal was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shareholders-back-55bn-acquisition?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">approved by EA shareholders</a> in late December and now goes to regulatory review. Given the current political climate in the US, and given that Affinity was founded by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the odds any of these letters amount to anything feel pretty slim to me. But I'm heartened to see a number of US politicians recognize the magnitude of this deal and its potential consequences on games workers. As the letter concludes, "workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued," and this sale is certainly not a way to get it. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump/"><div><p>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On - Aftermath</p><p>EA says that its sale to Saudi Arabia will not come at the price of creative control.

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake On Switch 2 Is A Good Way To Play A Great Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851</link>
            <guid>1413748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brings a 2021 PlayStation 5 upgrade of a 2020 PS4 game to a 2025 gaming handheld hybrid in 2026. It’s a good port of a great game and suggests a bright future for third-party blockbusters on Switch 2 from publishers willing to invest the time and resources into doing it right.</p> <p>I played the new version, out January 22, for around four hours, racing back through the early section of the game in time to meet back up with Aerith and stroll through some of the more taxing areas in the early game. I was struck by two things during my brief return to the slums of Midgar. The first was just how linear, focused, and cinematic the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is compared to its sprawling successor, <em>Rebirth</em>. It was fun, refreshing, and nostalgic—all the things that made the 2020 game worth its long wait.</p>

 <p>The second was how rarely it felt like I was playing a nerfed version <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, one compromised for a portable device (I played almost exclusively in handheld mode). It’s locked at 30fps instead of something higher but that never felt like a drag. The textures, lighting, and particle effects never drew attention for the wrong reasons. I never sat there in a boss fight or cutscene thinking, “This is fine but I wished it looked better.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000662353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662353"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662353">Digital Foundry / Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a vibe check backed up by technical analyses from the experts. A very thorough review of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>‘s performance on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUjYGy7cqog">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> finds that it’s weaker than the PS5 version in some areas but generally better than the PS4 one across the board. There is no infamously low-res texture eternally waiting to load on Cloud’s 7th Heaven apartment door. Pop-in is mostly a non-issue. The lighting in many scenes is more detailed than in the PS4 version as well.</p>

 <p>The only real place the Switch 2 port falters is when it comes to hair in handheld mode. It’s a small issue but a noticeable one for a game whose hero’s most defining feature is a Chocobo’s nest of spikey blond hair. From Tifa’s long ponytail to Aerith’s brunette braids, there’s often dithering and fuzziness. Some of the UI elements occasionally feel especially small or hard to read in handheld mode as well. It didn’t shatter my immersion but the game isn’t completely free of small downgrades here or there that remind you you aren’t playing on one of the high-end home consoles (the Switch 2 version arrived alongside the Xbox Series X/S ports).</p>

 <p>If you’re someone who never owned a PS4, PS5, or PC that could play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, I’d recommend the Switch 2 version without hesitation. If the Switch 2 is the only console you’ve ever owned, I might even call it a “must buy” relative to the rest of the console’s library right now. PlayStation owners take access to games like this for granted. For Nintendo fans, it’s still a special treat, and hopefully the first of many.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We live in a post-platform world. Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo are no longer treating each other like they’re adversaries of the “he who must not be named” variety in their marketing material. Though console warriors are still fighting that battle in comments sections like soldiers who don’t know the war has ended, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation</span></a><span>, so the war is over. Not only does that mean we get games on more platforms than we once did, but we also get some brainbreaking moments, like today when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer Game Freak was featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>in an Xbox showcase</span></a><span>, and we got a rare look into the studio that made Pikachu.</span></p>  <p><span>The Tokyo office Game Freak operates out of has been the company’s home </span><a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2020/11/09/game-freak-offices-tokyo/"><span>since 2020</span></a><span> when it moved to be closer to Nintendo’s own offices in the same building, called Kanda Square. It’s been about as long since we last got a good look inside the company’s office, whose decor is based on the Kanto region of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i> <i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green</span></i><span>. While the studio was showing off its upcoming action RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>in today’s video presentation, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>got namedropped several times over footage of the team working on the game in its Kanda Square office. The clips we see show an office that, in some rooms, looks like any other video game developer’s space, with concept art on the walls and computers in cubicles. But some rooms look much different, like one that is covered in trees to look like Kanto’s Viridian Forest.</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s name was said a few times in the showcase and this room is an homage to one of its most iconic early “dungeons,” as far as I can tell there’s no sign of a Pikachu or Poké Ball in these brief glimpses into Game Freak’s inner sanctum. I understand why they wouldn’t show us shots of the team working on upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, but I am surprised that there’s not even a frame of iconography in these shots. That feels like a deliberate choice, perhaps to not distract from </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>The Viridian Forest backdrop does work for the upcoming Xbox/PC/PS5 game, though, as it takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy Japan in which nature has reclaimed much of the land. Still, it’s odd to get an intimate look inside the historically secretive studio from an Xbox showcase. It’s a shame Pikachu didn’t get to make a cameo appearance, but I sincerely doubt we’ll be seeing a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game on Xbox, even as the console barriers are falling down.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak showed a pretty lengthy look at its new action-RPG </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> during today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>. The studio is primarily known for its work on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, though. Given that recent entries like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span> were notorious for being pretty ugly and running very poorly on the original Switch, you might be wondering how </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>looks as good as it does. Will it end up having similar technical troubles? Well, we won’t know for sure until the game launches in the summer, but Game Freak was recently asked this exact question.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking with game director Kota Furushima, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game"><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asked</span></a><span> about </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s ambitions after games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> struggled with performance despite not chasing nearly the same level of same fidelity or scope. Furushima’s answer might sound encouraging for </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, but it also feels like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is catching strays.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><b>IGN: </b><span>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</span></p> <p><b>Furushima:</b><span> I think when it comes to </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we’re not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We’re looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>The unspoken implication here is that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are not the type of “specific game experience” that requires the aforementioned bug fixes and optimization. It feels like an offshoot of the argument people who run defense for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games make by saying “people don’t play these games for the graphics,” as if that means they shouldn’t still aspire to not look like GameCube games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>asks about the size of the team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> since Game Freak is a relatively small developer that is also working on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>projects year-round. Furushima says the multi-studio headcount is “quite large,” but the actual internal Game Freak team working on </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is “relatively small” and mostly leading the project through direction and management.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we’re lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well,” Furushima says.</span></p>

 <p><span>It sounds like </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span> might not suffer the same technical troubles as Game Freak’s </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games since it’s not being developed primarily internally like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and the upcoming Gen X games. Will any of </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation</span></i><span>’s fidelity end up rubbing off on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>? Who knows. </span><i><span>Beast of Reincarnation </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this summer.</span></p>

Wonder is a delightfully inventive and downright trippy video game. One of the earliest hallucinogenic bits you encounter are talking flowers. If you’re a fan of the chatty flora, you’re in luck: you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxe07P?object_uuid=af91a900-9ec9-4fe1-8f1b-f8f2a21c7bde&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder</a> a plastic Talking Flower of your own right now.

It’s more of a decoration that occasionally talks. You set it on a desk, shelf, or bedside table, and the thing will say something periodically (Nintendo says it speaks roughly twice an hour). It says things like, “Is it weird for flowers to talk?” Or, “Sometimes it’s nice to space out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has a button you can press to make it talk on command. If you press the button repeatedly, it will utter “special phrases,” whatever that means. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talking Flower doesn’t have any built-in AI and it’s not connected to an LLM. It doesn’t have a microphone, so it’s not listening like an Amazon Echo, and you can’t hold a conversation with it. But it does have a built-in clock, so it can make comments about the time of day it is. It can also sense the temperature and make comments about that. </p></div><div id="183351"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="183351" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Bros.

It then plays music, and you can press the button in time with the music to make it react.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can have it speak in the morning when you want to wake up, like an alarm clock (lookin’ at you, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-alarmo">Alarmo</a>). You can also press and hold the button to make it be quiet for a while. It also won’t talk over night. The Talking Flower supports 11 languages. If you want one of your own, you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxe07P?object_uuid=af91a900-9ec9-4fe1-8f1b-f8f2a21c7bde&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a> at the Nintendo Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Super Mario Bros. Wonder news, the game is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade, plus a new expansion called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-release-date-plus-elephant-mario-and-captain-toad-amiibo">Meetup in Bellabell Park</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has announced new <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansions for 2026. The latest additions to the asymmetrical competitive board game featuring the baddies of Disney will feature villains from more recent animated movies, as well as a certain spooky entry from the 90s.</p><h2>The Disney Villainous Expansions for 2026</h2><p>According to an official press release, two new <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansions are coming this year. The first is titled <em>Disney Villainous: Success At Any Cost</em>. This expansion will include two playable characters: the double-crossing Prince Hans from <em>Frozen</em>, and the conniving musician from <em>Coco's</em> land of the dead, Ernesto de la Cruz.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frozen-prince-hans-image.jpg?itok=kkwTP1A3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="581">

  </picture><p>Like all playable characters in <em>Disney Villainous</em>, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-villainous-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-brings-darth-maul-and-captain-phasma-to-table" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Villainous</em></a>, both Hans and Ernesto will have their own special mechanics. These mechanics are themed around each character, including unique win and lose conditions. The presser doesn't specify what these conditions are, but it can be speculated that both involve playing a long con of some kind without anyone being the wiser.</p><p>For those in the United States, there is a special edition version of <em>Disney Villainous: Success At Any Cost</em>. This version of the game will feature classic papel picado artwork, reminiscent of art seen at Dia de los Muertos festivals, complete with a special finish on Ernesto's mover. The catch is that this version is exclusive to Target. The expansion will be available at an MSRP of $22.99.</p><p>The second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion, <em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!,</em> will showcase the witches from the 1990s Halloween movie, <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. The expansion contains one villain, the Sanderson Sisters, complete with their own sculpted mover, unique illustrations, and bespoke mechanics.</p><p>Notably, this is the second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion to feature a baddie from a live-action Disney movie. The first was Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean series.</p><p><em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!</em> will be available in the second half of 2026 at an MSRP of $14.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

This follows previous reporting that the game survived Wednesday’s massive restructuring, which saw seven games canceled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">including a <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>&nbsp;remake</a>.</p> <p>On January 22, Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email that <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2,</em> which was first announced back in 2008 and has popped up multiple times since then, is still in development and wasn’t canceled. The company behind <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> also reconfirmed that the<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> franchise is still a part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">newly restructured Ubisoft</a>. Here’s the company’s full statement:</p>

 <p>“As mentioned in yesterday’s press release,<em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> will be part of Creative House 4, dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes. <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> remains a priority for us in the context of our strategy centered around Open World Adventures,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson.</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Uyw5x2TIuaQ"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> was first teased all the way back in 2008</a> via a trailer that seemed to feature some early gameplay. That version of the game is long gone. In 2017, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-lives-and-its-a-prequel-1796032984?_gl=1*1dmrw0u*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTcxMDMxMy4yMDYuMS4xNzI5NzEyODE5LjYwLjAuMA..">Ubisoft reannounced</a> <em>BG&amp;E2,</em> revealing that it was now a large-scale open-world sci-fi game and a prequel to the events of the 2003 action-platformer. Since then, the game has seemed trapped in development hell, <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-ubisoft-montpellier-assassins-creed-1850164420">losing its creative director in 2023</a>. But apparently the game is still happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744">One day. Probably.</a></p>

 <p>Ubisoft didn’t share any information on when <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> will launch or what platforms to expect the open-world game on. So the wait continues.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft are telling the world that the sooner we all switch to using generative AI tools in our day-to-day lives, the sooner we will 10x ourselves. Yet the corporation are still only finding haphazard pick up by videogame developers, including some of their own studios.</p>
<p>As executive producer Susan Kath tells me, the Elder Scrolls Online team haven't yet found a part of development where they can use it. "Right now, we generally use it for things like this," Kath says, indicating our call. "A lot of us get a lot of use out of Copilot, for meetings, for summaries, inbox organisations, stuff like that."</p>
<p>But, in the case of art, coding, or writing, generative AI is not something the team are using in Elder Scrolls Online's development, and its adoption is still an open discussion within the studio. "I don't know what our decision is going to be, because we're still having conversations about where we go with that," Kath says. "Obviously we all have strong opinions within the studio. Obviously Microsoft has invested heavily in this. That would be a thing that I would imagine we would talk about in the future."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I asked for more detail, wanting to know the contentions of that discussion. Was the slow adoption because of objections on moral or ethical grounds, because the technology wasn't capable of doing the work well enough, or because the bits of the job generative AI is meant to replace are the parts of the job developers enjoy doing?</p><p>"Can the answer be all of the above?" Kath laughs. "It may be useful right now. There are areas where [AI]'s probably really good at doing things that we don't necessarily want to use it for, for whatever reasons. In the cases where it does work for us, we will explore using that. I don't know that I could go deeper. It's hard, because we're talking about something where I'm like 'We don't [use it] right now, because the areas where we would anticipate that it would be useful, potentially it might not be where we need it to be yet'."</p>
<p>In the spirit of openness, I'm having a similar discussion with the RPS team. For instance, I used an AI tool to create a rough transcription of this interview before cleaning it up manually in a separate tool. But this isn't something everyone on the team would do, with some choosing not to use any generative AI transcription tools. We're still establishing a line on whether these tools can benefit us and if we should use any of them if they could help our work. Let alone which tools would take away the parts of the job we actually enjoy doing.</p>
<p>The above doesn't even address how using AI tools impacts our relationship with you, the reader. One of the worst things I could do as RPS's editor would be to publish an article written by AI. You come to this site to read our work, not something that we couldn't be bothered to write ourselves.</p>
<p>I say all this to Kath, ending with how it's complex to navigate, she agrees. "For example, it's incredibly useful to do research with, but also I really like doing research – I'm sure that you have encountered the same. It's absolutely useful to ask 'Go do a bunch of research for me'. But ultimately, that's also one of the really fun parts of what I do from time to time."</p>
<p>So, in short, another day, another couple of people stumbling through the increasingly machine world we live in.</p>
<p>I want to flag that this was a rushed discussion at the end of an interview, so we only spoke briefly on the subject. I was more intent to learn about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">the impact of last year's layoffs on the studio</a> and to clarify aspects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-yearly-expansions-and-folding-its-premium-content-into-the-base-game-but-its-also-gaining-a-battle-pass">the recent move to Season updates instead of big Chapter expansions</a>, confirming, for instance, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-seasons-will-add-new-zones-but-itll-be-a-different-flavour">we would still see new zones added to the game</a>.</p><p>However, I do think it's an important discussion to have, especially in light of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">Larian's recent open discussion of the technology</a> and where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">they found generative AI's limits prevented it from being useful</a>. After all, Microsoft are one of the biggest backers of generative AI. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid the technolgy's tendrils, in part because companies like Microsoft are insistent that we use it, if only to justify their investment. If the corporation's own developers are struggling to find the benefits of the technology, or questioning whether they should adopt it, then why shouldn't we?</p>

              <p>One of Nintendo’s “old guard” appears to be retiring.<em> Spare Marine 2</em>‘s new multiplayer class is almost here. And fans are expected to shell out $685 for a gaming chair that looks like it was made out of Pikachu’s skin. It’s another edition of Moring Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Hey, it’s morning somewhere, right? Here’s what an early, third-person prototype of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2014370210115948828">supposedly looked like</a>.</p> <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was Kensuke Tanabe’s last game</h2> <p>That’s according to a new interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Japanese magazine <em>Nintendo Dream</em></a> that was uploaded to <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. “Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward,” he said, according <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">to <em>VGC</em></a>. “Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms. Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.” “Ms. Tabata” refers to fellow veteran Risa Tabata, who will likely succeed him. Tanabe is 62 and his time at the <em>Mario</em> maker dates back to directing <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> escapes another round of cancellations</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that it’s one of the ongoing projects at Ubisoft that remains safe, even if it still might not ship for a couple more years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a> that the project had a new creative lead back in 2024.

The post-launch content roadmap is so convoluted, publisher Bandai Namco even released a flowchart to guide fans on what to purchase based on what part of <em>Dragon Ball</em> they actually care about.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> reveals its next playable class</h2> <p>Techmarines will join the game in Patch 12 later this winter. “Like all classes, the Techmarine comes with a unique Combat Skill (an ‘ult,’ so to speak) and his own perk tree with 25 levels to unlock,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/">new post on <em>Xbox Wire</em></a>. “But more than anything, what makes him special are the mechanical arms and automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.”</p>

There’s a new Warbond, too.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>‘s next set adds more Mega Evolution ex cards</h2> <p>After almost a year away I’m curious to come back.

            <title><![CDATA[The Human Cost: Ubisoft’s Next Cost-Cutting Measure Could See Another 2000+ Jobs Lost]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/</link>
            <guid>1413652</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday’s Ubisoft announcement of its massive restructuring has made headlines across the industry for cancelling projects, closing down studios, and delaying projects, but one of the biggest announcements, for the most part, has been overlooked by many.</p>







<p>I am, of course, talking about the human impact of the recent restructuring and recently announced cost-cutting measures aimed to save the publisher an additional 200 million euros by the end of March 2028, which could result in thousands of more developers losing their jobs.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, this will be the “third and final phase” of its cost-cutting, and will end by March 2028. Ubisoft is still going through its second phase, which started four years ago and was a 300 million euro cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>In that time, Ubisoft has decreased its headcount from 20,729 (as of September 2022) to 17,097 (as of September 2025), a reduction of 3632 developers. Ubisoft London, Osaka, San Francisco, Leamington, Halifax, and Stockholm have all closed their doors. More layoffs at the company will also be announced on February 12, 2026.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take a genius, then, to see that an additional 200 million euros in cost-cutting will lead to yet more studio closures and layoffs. Ubisoft’s third cost-cutting measure will be two-thirds of the second round, so with that round seeing 3632 jobs lost and using similar proportions, we can calculate that the next round could see approximately 2400 jobs lost by the end of March 2028.</p>



<p>On top of that, Ubisoft is set to enforce a return-to-office mandate of 5 days a week, while offering “annual allowances” for working from home. It’s a move that Ubisoft says will help with “efficiency, creativity, and collective success,” but many developers see it as another attempt to force yet more employees to leave the company as part of cost savings.</p>







<p>It’s part of Ubisoft’s strategy to prevent announcing mass layoffs (for the most part) to avoid negative press. Over the last few years, Ubisoft has continued to reduce its headcount through similar ploys, including not renewing contracts, giving developers nothing to do in the hopes they’ll leave, and enforcing RTO mandates.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bigger-change-is-needed">A Bigger Change is Needed</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has been on a downward trend for a number of years (despite having a great future pipeline of games), but the constant mismanagement, structural changes, and lack of ownership from higher-ups have led to one of the most horrible environments for developers to work in in the games industry.</p>



<p>How are developers meant to get excited about their work and be productive and creative when they know thousands more of their colleagues will likely be gone in the next couple of years? When the same mistakes from leadership continue to happen year after year without accountability? When another restructuring and more cost-cutting measures will happen in the coming years?</p>



<p>It’s pretty evident that Ubisoft’s big restructuring needs to happen from the top and not the other way around.</p>



<p>We all know what needs to happen, but stubbornness is worse than witchcraft.</p>

During the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, the studio showed off more gameplay for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682371/beast-of-reincarnation-game-freak-xbox-games-showcase-trailer">its action RPG <em>Beast of Incarnation</em></a>, and confirmed that it will be launching in the summer of 2026 on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p>Here’s the overview that aired during the event:</p><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is set in a postapocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, and it’s described as a “one-person one-dog action RPG,” with a world and gameplay designed to evoke the feelings of “warmth, trust, and loneliness.” In practice, it looks a little like a cross between <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, which means lots of cool monster designs and what looks to be very intense combat that blends elements of real-time action and turn-based RPGs. And, yes, it definitely seems like you can pet the dog.</p><p>In development for six years, the game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23716737/game-freak-developer-project-bloom-game">first revealed back in 2023 under the codename Project Bloom</a>, and has since undergone a publishing shift. It was originally under the label Private Division, which was previously part of Take-Two Interactive. But the label has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">since been sold off</a> and is now operating under the name Fictions.</p><p>And while Game Freak is best known as the primary developer behind the <em>Pokémon</em> series, the studio has dabbled in outside projects from time to time, though these tend to be smaller-scale titles like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537624/apple-arcade-game-freak-pokemon-pocket-card-jockey-ride-on">Pocket Card Jockey</a></em> or <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/21/9008871/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review-xbox-ps4-pc">Tembo the Badass Elephant</a></em>. <em>Beast of Incarnation</em> represents the studio’s biggest non-<em>Pokémon</em> project to date.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/865588/beast-of-reincarnation-trailer-date-pokemon-game-freak]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1413625</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: New Horizons got a big 3.0 update earlier this month, which alongside a lot of new content for everyone included a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade with some fancy technological buffs. One of those was the ability to play with up to 12 total people on the same island, up from eight in the original version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds fun, right? Wrong. It's a nightmare. A nightmare once again spawned by Nintendo handling online functionality in the most ridiculous way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was so foolish and naive a week ago, when I first had the idea to get 12 of us together for an Animal Crossing session. It would be easy, I thought! So easy, I originally didn't even plan on writing anything about it! Let me just call up...11 other people I know who are still playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who also have Nintendo Switch 2s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And somehow we'll manage to find an hour we can all do this, despite everyone being busy adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, harder than I thought, but we did it! Last night, a group of 12 of us all logged on at once with a plan to meet up on my island. We considered using the Game Chat functionality, but decided against it due to lack of compatibility with Bluetooth headsets, the function's friending requirements, and the fact that you can't take screenshots while Game Chat is active. Discord it was, then, apparently still the second-best place for Nintendo Voice Chat (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">after the podcast, of course</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092311-01kfk4k4x1qaac3z7dje12vshc-1769104423045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was for an hour-long session from 9pm to 10pm last night, but I recalled that the cutscene for people landing on the island was a bit lengthy, and we'd have to watch it 11 times, so I logged on half an hour early to open my island so we could start filtering in. I was hopeful that with improved Nintendo Switch 2 loading times, it might not be so bad. And it's true, the actual loading times were notably faster, though most of the wait for people to land is a combination of said cutscene ("We'll be making a water landing, but that's OK because this is a seaplane.") and everyone saving the game each time, so we didn't really shorten the wait by that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that was to be expected. Here was where the nightmare began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 8:35pm, my friends began trickling in. We managed to get three people in before the entire session crashed, booting out everyone who had showed up so far and shutting my islands gates for me. I reopened at 8:46pm and we started again, this time creating a "queue" in our Discord text chat so everyone didn't try to flood in at once. At 8:58pm, one of my friends got an error that kicked her out alongside one other person, but everyone else stayed, so we brought them back and continued down the line.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092308-01kfk4hw7zj58ec37nepwcgtp8-1769104446457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:19pm, I typed in Discord, "WE DID IT" as person #12 seemingly landed successfully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:21pm, as person #12 strolled in, another error occurred and two other people got kicked out. At this point, my husband (who was playing Ace Attorney next to me) started rolling his eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:24pm, one of the people who had been kicked out tried to rejoin, errored out, and the whole session crashed again. Every single person got booted back to their islands and my gates were closed again, just as we were finally about to taste success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please enjoy this timelapse video, courtesy of our intrepid Wiki writer KBABZ, of 40 minutes of us trying desperately to get everyone onto the island, only for the unthinkable to happen right at the very end:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was undaunted. By golly, we got all these people together, we were going to hit each other with nets and drop recipe cards for each other! We started again from the top. This time I forbade everyone from doing anything once they landed aside from standing still in a line next to the airport. No menuing. No talking to villagers. Nothing. Folks started coming back in at 9:27pm. At 9:37pm, the fourth person to join crashed the island again. At 9:39pm, almost 40 minutes after our planned start time, we began yet again. Everyone posted cat pics in the Discord channel for emotional support.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092312-01kfk4kh4kd89e5tn3ez40q8zk-1769104468431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This time worked. Finally, at 10:05pm, after multiple crashes and false starts, we had 12 people on my Animal Crossing island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092315-01kfk4mbwv3js65mw1jeptph91-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm happy to report that after the <em>90 minute ordeal</em> that was getting 12 people onto one island, online play actually worked great. We all exchanged gifts, took a pic in the Town Square, explored the island, and got coffee at Brewster's. People wrote on my bulletin board and sent me letters. Some borrowed my Wario costume from the hotel. A couple people decided to play pranks, burying junk and trapping my villagers with holes. It was genuinely a pretty great time. It just, you know, took way too dang long to set up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092320-01kfk4pdtcz6we4gfvt9j2an9t-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's baffling to me that Nintendo's infrastructure for Animal Crossing is still set up this way. Yes, the island landing cutscene is very cute, and I do think the sea plane line is pretty funny. But why on earth do we need to sit through it 11 times, with everyone who's not traveling collectively watching a mostly-blank airport-themed loading screen? Why does everything on my island need to completely freeze and exit menus so someone can come in? Why does Group Stretching require me to be Best Friends with everyone on my island? How much worse would all this have been if we had used Game Chat? Mario Kart World doesn't have this problem!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092323-01kfk4q36ntgqn62xk8tmvvetf-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The best explanation I can think of is that Nintendo genuinely didn't intend for anyone to use this feature in the first place. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update is fun, sure, but it's not creating the same massive surge in interest that existed in 2020 when we were all locked at home and had nothing better to do than ponder whatever it is that Dodos do. You're unlikely to ever need to collect 11 friends and drag them to your island all at once. Heck, given how hard this was to schedule, I'll be lucky to get four one of these weekends.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092325-01kfk4qm2h3qkextzwa2w2j5v7-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very fun to play with friends, but it's still a massive pain in the butt to actually set up the circumstances for that play to be possible. Next time I'll just get everyone together for Jackbox.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092326-01kfk4qyknppc2dj0vk9fw215x-1769104546250.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">checking out the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Game Freak's upcoming action game Beast of Reincarnation reemerged at the Xbox Developer Direct, with a lengthy segment showing off traversal, combat, its cast of characters, some dang good music, and more. Also, great news, it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-gets-new-look-at-actionrpg-hybrid-combat-and-a-summer-release-window">apparently out this summer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is a fascinating new game, and an anomaly in Game Freak's portfolio. Game Freak is, of course, best-known for developing Pokemon, a series that's grown in scope as it's transitioned to home console releases but has also seen notable declines in performance and visual quality. But Game Freak has also been increasing its other independent endeavors in recent years, with games such as HarmoKnight, Tembo the Badass Elephant, and Pocket Card Jockey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But aside from Pokemon all of those have been fairly small-scale endeavors. Though we haven't gotten our hands on Beast of Reincarnation yet, this <em>looks</em> far more ambitious. It's a full-on action game, for one, with what seems to be pretty complex and multi-layered combat and movement. It's also, if the trailers are any indication, really pretty, and a departure from Game Freak's historically more cartoony style. That's led to plenty of questions as to what led Game Freak to make something like this in the first place, and whether or not the studio can pull it off. At least from what we saw today, there's reason for optimism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with Kota Furushima, game director of Beast of Reincarnation, to chat about some of these topics, as well as get some further details on what exactly the game will be. Here's our full interview transcript, very lightly edited for clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Beast of Reincarnation seems very, very different from anything Game Freak has done before. How did this game come to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kota Furushima: </strong>So, it all started, I wanted to get something going. It was an original project. I wanted to try something completely different and new, unlike other stuff we've made. And it just so happened that internally, here at Game Freak, we have a program we call the Gear Project, which is sort of an internal contest run by our president, Satoshi Tajiri, to make original IP within the company. So, I entered my design doc into that contest, and I was able to get permission to start working on a project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I should mention too, to clarify, it wasn't so much that I was trying to do something different than what we've done before. I started with the concept of the feeling that I wanted to get across to the users, the feeling of loneliness, isolation, and warmth, and the game design that we have now kind of coalesced naturally around that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long ago was it that you entered this in the contest?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>It was about six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation does seem to be a significantly larger game than some of the other, I guess, non-Pokemon projects you've worked on before. Did the studio have to scale up significantly for Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak. We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>PR reached out post-interview to clarify that the internal Game Freak team working on Beast of Reincarnation is "relatively small" while still playing a core role in leading the project through direction and management.</em>] </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you tell me about the original pitch that you entered into the contest, like what that original sort of design looked like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, it was pretty simple at first. The general concept was the idea of taking a journey along with a companion. That was the main pillar of the game, and you started thinking about the feelings you wanted the player to have, and gradually, the design sort of began to coalesce around that idea of the journey with the companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was there anything in particular that inspired you throughout the development of the game, other games, film, art, music, just any other art in particular that you were thinking of, as you worked on Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. I mentioned I'm a big fan of science fiction movies to start with, and because I wanted to create this new world that no one had seen before, I started really putting a lot of thought into the way world building is done and science fiction. Blade Runner was a specific one that I can mention, that does such a good job of world building. I wanted to try and create my own world in a similar sort of fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, Beast of Reincarnation, I know, was originally announced under the Private Division label when it was part of Take-Two, and then Private Division got acquired, renamed, and is now being run by different people. I'm curious if all those changes impacted the development of Beast of Reincarnation in any way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> There's probably not much I can say about that, to be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, tell me a bit about the structure of Beast of Reincarnation. Is it a linear, story focused game? Is it open world, Metroidvania, something else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The way we created this game, it is about a journey with a beginning, middle, and end, right? It kind of conjures up images of a road movie sort of thing, so it's not open world in the purest sense. The game is comprised of different stages, but these stages I would not describe as linear either. There's quite a lot of room for exploration, a lot of radiation between the different environments and things of that nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are you primarily doing in these different stages? Are you primarily fighting creatures? Are you doing more exploration? Are there puzzles? What are the main activities that you're doing as the character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> You're doing a lot of different things in the game. I think there are no traditional puzzles to put block progress, for instance, as you saw them, but there are definitely puzzle adjacent segments of the game. For example, this game takes place in a world that's been largely destroyed, so you could come to a part where you want to get across a chasm, and the bridge has been destroyed, so you have to start thinking, "How can I get across there?" Now, luckily, Emma, the main character, has a lot of abilities at her disposal. She can extend at the vine or plant, I don't know what you call it, her hair actually. I mean, she can use that, for example, to cross a chasm instead of a bridge, right? So she has certain abilities at her disposal that can help her get through this world. Of course, battle is a huge part of the game, as well as exploration. There's definitely parts where you want to see what's off the beaten path as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How challenging is the combat?  I'm curious if there's difficulty settings or if a casual player could pick it up and feel comfortable with counters and things like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>First of all, I should say that, yes, there are three difficulty settings in the game. As many people to play it as possible, there's going to be story mode. There's a little bit easier, there's normal mode, and then of course there's hard move where enemies are significantly stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the normal mode, it's important to note that the game is not just played through the single character of Emma. She, of course, has her companion Koo. Koo also has actions that he can use in conjunction with Emma. There's a lot of freedom and variety of what you can do in the game. Beast of Reincarnation is, of course, an action RPG. Players have the freedom to think of their own strategy and the way they're going to tap all certain situations, how to best utilize Emma's abilities and Koo's abilities to suit their own play-style with which they're most comfortable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beast of Reincarnation Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you give me an example of a type of play style you're referring to? Are we thinking the difference between close range and long range? Is it more magical or physical? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a lot of variety in the game. As far as the main actions of the player that Emma is going to undertake for attacks, she largely relies on her Katana for close range attacks. She also has the ability to attack a long range with bows, crossbows, and those sorts of weapons. Koo, of course, relies primarily on what we call bloom arts, which are kind of plant-based attacks in the game. You'll find yourself up against some pretty big enemies, and the rhythm of a lot of the combat does center around pairing, countering, and things of that nature, but you also, again, have an added layer of using Koo and his abilities to your advantage as well, so there's quite a lot of variety there that different people can use in different ways to suit their own style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about Emma and Koo as characters? Who are they? How would you describe them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>One thing to note is, at the beginning of the game, Emma is kind of a blank slate. She has neither memories nor emotions or feelings when you first meet her. Koo, you'll soon discover, is what are known in this world as malefacts. He has this blight, or this corruption about him. You will notice in the game, too, that Emma herself is also a blighted one, and although this does give her special abilities, the downside of that is, of course, she's not treated well by other humans. She's living a very isolated lifestyle, essentially banished. What we have here, typically in this world, Emma would consider a creature like Koo to be an enemy because he is blighted. She typically fights against these sorts of enemies, so there's a bit of irony in this game, that she ends up teaming up with Koo and they go on this journey together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the music in Beast of Reincarnation? I really enjoyed the music that I heard in the trailer, and I was curious who was composing it and what the vision and style was.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, starting with the concepts of the score, again, the music is very much focused on the game's core concepts themselves, out of loneliness and isolation and learning to rely on people, that sort of motif and sort of feeling. So there's all sorts of different types of songs in the game. There's some focus on amplifying the trusting relationship that Emma develops with Koo. Some focus on the loneliness and despair of the world itself that's been destroyed. Then, we have the bosses in the game, which are called Nushi. Their music tracks tend to focus on more kind of traditional, Japanese sort of instrumentation. They give it a difference as well, so there's a lot of variety in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know Game Freak has a lot of history of delving into mythology and nature, especially with all the Pokemon designs they've done over the years to create really interesting creatures, and I'm curious if we'll see any particular myths, legends, or types of creatures in the world of Beast of Reincarnation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think what you'll see in the game is a lot of the natural environments, whether it be the plant life, the flora, and the fauna in this game, the animals and the plants are very much based on the plant life and animal life that we see here in Japan and we've seen here in Japan throughout our history. Sakura, cherry blossoms would be a good example of that. It definitely has a sort of a local feel, in terms of the creatures that you'll meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. Beast of Reincarnation looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think when it comes to Beast of Reincarnation, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we're not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We're looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-heroart-1769108376624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Beast of Reincarnation official artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the, I guess they're called the Nushi, the bosses. In the presentation I saw they create these blighted forests, and that the environment will change. Can you tell me a little more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The Nushi, as you said, they're kind of bosses in the game, but sitting above the Nushi is the ultimate presence in the game, the Beast of Reincarnation itself, which the game is named after, Emma and Koo essentially start their journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation, but in order to do that, they face off against Nushi on the way there as a way to sort of weaken the Beast of Reincarnation and make it a boss they can actually take on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as you defeat these Nushi, you get new abilities from them, and you continue on your journey to ultimately face off against the Beast of Reincarnation. You touched on the blighted forest as well. So the Nushi, Beast of Reincarnation, again, is the reason that the world is kind of in this fall and corroded and blighted state. The Nushi themselves create these blighted forests around them, as you noted. The environment actually changes. From there, from those forests, the enemies in the game, the biological enemies, the Malefacts, are also kind of part and parcel with what it is that the Nushis are bringing into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does that imply that something we'll be doing is going back and revisiting areas we've been before, when the blighted forest is there or not there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a couple of parts to that question there. So, one thing to note, simply defeating a Nushi is not really enough to change the environment in a really meaningful way. Ultimately, the Beast of Reincarnation has kind of a grasp on all of the land and has kind of turned it this way, so you're not able to make huge changes to the environment by defeating Nushi, but you can absolutely go back to places you've been, and you're oftentimes going to want to explore and find hidden areas and items and things of that nature. There's plenty of secrets to discover in places that essentially you've already been through, you're able to freely go back and keep exploring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is that because she has these plant hair abilities. I assume she's getting more of these, as you progress, that are going to unlock more things. Is that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Actually, there's not a lot of that sort of exploration in the game. You're basically able to get where you need to go with your default abilities. The real question is how. You can see a place you want to go, but do you know how to get there yet? I think, as the player gets more and more accustomed to using these abilities, you'll start to get inspired and understand you're leveling up, I guess, as a player, rather than the character getting abilities that will unlock kind of locations and places. It's more about coming to terms with, getting a grip on, and getting better at using those abilities yourself as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You guys have a really long, historical relationship with Nintendo. Is there any chance we'll see this game come to Nintendo Switch 2 eventually?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's nothing to announce right now about other platforms that have not already been announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have one more question. Can you pet the dog?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
