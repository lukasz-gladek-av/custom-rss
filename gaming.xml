			<p>Today, Spanish developer MercurySteam has confirmed the name of their new project, a single player dark fantasy action RPG titled Blades of Fire. They also <a href="https://x.com/ProjectIronGame/status/1894054680499716236?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> its unveiling would occur this Thursday at 10:30 AM Pacific Time or 18:30 GMT at IGN Fan Fest 2025.</p>
<p>The Madrid-based studio released several noteworthy titles over its more than 20 years in the games industry, such as the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy for Konami and two acclaimed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-dread-is-now-the-series-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid games</a> for Nintendo. Their self-published game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-game-is-raiders-of-the-broken-planet-an-online-multiplayer-asymmetric-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raiders of the Broken Planet</a>, later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spacelords-raiders-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relaunched as Spacelords</a>, did not succeed, though. This time, they have partnered with another publisher (505 Games) instead of going solo once again.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of info on Blades of Fire except for an interview Gamereactor <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/project-iron-will-have-strong-graphics-storytelling-and-action-1292253/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did with Game Director Enric Álvarez in 2023</a>. On that occasion, he said:</p>
<p><em>I think that we're going to surprise you with this game. I think that it's going to please people, it's going to surprise people, and it's going to shock people as well. Of course, it will be a full-blown MercurySteam game, so it will have strong graphics, strong storytelling, strong action, and many more things I can't disclose right now.</em></p>
<p><em>We always work with our own technology. We can afford that luxury because from the day one in the studio, 20 years ago, we had the capacity to do it. And the Mercury Engine is still there in full form. I mean, it's an excellent technology. And the best thing is that it's our property, and then we develop exactly what we need, like a tailor-made suit.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be powered by the studio's internal technology and features 'strong storytelling and action' elements. We'll have to wait just three days to learn more directly from MercurySteam. Stay tuned until then!</p>

<p>Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord have won their respective appeals against their PEGI ratings. Both will now be rated PEGI 12 as opposed to the PEGI 18 rating they have had since launch.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a>, explanations were given for the move down for each game. </p>



<p>For Balatro, the PEGI Complaints Board says that “although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements”.</p>



<p>In regards to Luck Be A Landlord, the board had the same arguments as it did for Balatro. It added that “although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills”.</p>



<p>“PEGI acknowledges the finding of the Complaints Board appeals panel in regards to amending the classifications of these games,” the organization wrote. “The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process. PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.”</p>



<p>The announcement concluded saying that “on the basis of these appeals” the PEGI Experts Group will “develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review">Monster Hunter: World</a> blew the doors of the series wide open for a huge new audience in 2018 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-review">Monster Hunter Rise</a> gave us high-flying Wirebugs to more quickly zip around in 2021, it makes a lot of sense that Capcom would do whatever it can to welcome that newfound following into the next frontier. That’s exactly what Monster Hunter Wilds does, smoothing out the already excellent process of turning big scary dragons into silly little hats to be faster, more flexible, and less fiddly than ever before. The other side of those Dual Blades, however, is that Wilds is light on any real challenge, even for what I’d expect at launch, never asking me to think hard about my equipment. But while the monsters may not pose much of a threat this time around, smart tweaks to combat still mean the act of carving them up has rarely felt better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clear example of how Capcom has tried to better welcome new players is that the campaign in Wilds isn’t just a totally forgettable excuse to kill anything that crosses your path this time. Okay, it’s still <em>mostly</em> that, in that you and the Hunter’s Guild set out to explore yet another “uncharted” land in order to solve some environmental mystery – but while the story itself isn’t particularly fresh, the difference here is that the characters within it are actually pretty great. Whether it’s the excitable engineer Gemma, your empathetic handler Alma, or the total space cadet of a biologist Erik, your team is full of likeable personalities and little character arcs throughout the gorgeously animated cutscenes. That was enough to get me more invested in Wilds’ campaign than I’ve been in any previous Monster Hunter.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Monster Hunter Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The revamped structure of Wilds also means that campaign is significantly shorter than I was expecting. I reached the credits in just 15 hours and didn’t need to go back and fight a single monster twice in that time, getting enough materials from any initial encounters to keep my gear up to snuff and jump right from one mission to the next. When you compare that to the 40+ hours it took to see the end of the story in World, it’s clear that the intent is to allow more people to feel like they “beat” Wilds, and I can certainly appreciate how that shift toward approachability might appeal to folk who have otherwise been intimidated by the series. But as a veteran, I can’t help but be a little disappointed that I literally didn’t get knocked out once in that entire time, and I never hit a skill- or armor-testing wall of a monster who forced me to really think about my equipment more deeply in order to earn the reward of a hard-fought victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avoiding spoilers, there is more to do once you do get past the credits, of course. That’s where the larger changes Wilds makes to the traditional Monster Hunter loop really start to shine. Gone are the days of returning to a separate town between every hunt, then going down the same checklist of tasks before you’re ready for the next one. Pretty much everything you need is out in the field with you and every location is seamlessly connected to the others, from a flaming oil-filled basin to a frigid mountain top, meaning you’re never more than a lickety-split loading screen away from wherever you want to be. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gone are the days of returning to town between every single hunt.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Systems like cooking that let you prepare yourself for the ensuing hunt are still here, but now those food buffs last a set time after eating and don’t go away until the timer runs out – it doesn’t even tick down while in camp, making a previously repetitive process substantially smoother without removing the depth it added to hunts. Convenient adjustments like this are all over the place in Wilds, and the roaringly successful result is that a vast majority of the friction past games could produce as you start and stop and restart between every encounter has been removed. Now you can just check your map for monster information, jump on your mount, and <em>hunt</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those untamed expanses can be truly stunning, too. Each area will shift between three weather states with unique conditions depending on where you are. For example, the initial desert landscape starts dusty and washed out before turning into a full-on sandstorm with explosive lightning strikes and then finally giving way to a lush and vibrant period of plenty, while the forest follows a similar pattern but with torrential rain instead. These miniature seasons aren’t terribly impactful to your hunts in practice, but they can affect which monsters will appear, and it’s a true delight to see each hunting ground look dramatically different depending on when you are there. The only exceptions to this are a couple late-game areas that suffered from extremely distracting texture pop-in issues while I was playing on the PS5 Pro’s Balanced option, though things ran great apart from that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monsters you face on your expeditions are also generally excellent, whether that’s a returning banger like Gore Magala or a flashy newcomer like the flamenco-inspired spider Lala Barina. And while the headliner, Arkveld, is one of my favorites of the bunch thanks to its chain-like appendages, the true stunner has to be Nu Udra: The tentacles of Monster Hunter’s first octopus-like creature can be as unpredictable to contend with as you might expect (especially when they are literally on fire), but the satisfaction of severing every single one over the course of a hunt is second to none. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feel of fighting any of these monsters is also in a great spot for Wilds. The appeal of Monster Hunter’s fights has always been how it empowers you with flashy moves and hard-hitting attacks, but knowing <em>when</em> to strike and where to stand and how the monster will behave next is just as important as figuring out which buttons to press. These are hulking behemoths with varied and exciting moves of their own, and to some degree you really do have to be a hunter, not just an action hero, to take them down efficiently by learning their ins and outs. That’s true in Wilds too, but combat is also more flexible and forgiving, letting you adjust your footing a little more mid-combo, resulting in fewer moments where a mistimed attack with a long animation had me embarrassingly slicing at the air without losing the careful consideration these chunky strikes require.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wilds never challenged me with any real threats, even in the endgame.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That philosophy is complemented by the new Focus Mode that makes it a little easier to hone in on specific parts of a monster, and if you put enough punishment on a given limb (or head or flank) it’ll open up a Wound there. In many ways, the combat in Wilds feels like it’s all about Wounds, as they are essentially a resource that is earned and consumed across every fight. You’ll deal more damage to Wounds, but deal enough and they “break,” resetting that spot. Every weapon also has a simple-to-execute Focus Strike that will deal a burst of damage to a Wound and break it right away, so maximizing the amount of time you leave one open and then using that finisher before it closes naturally is an interesting sub-game to manage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, at least, it<em> would</em> be if Wilds ever presented me with a challenge that really asked me to make those considerations. Whether I was playing online with others, solo with the new AI Support Hunters at my side (which are a welcome and surprisingly competent addition), or alone with just my Palico helper, I never had a single mission reach the 20-minute mark, and I have only fainted two times <em>total</em> across dozens of hours<em>. </em>Compare that to something like Kirin in World, which smacked me silly my first couple of attempts and forced me to regroup and craft an armor set around thunder resistance, and it’s hard not to feel like Capcom’s desire to make Wilds a more inviting Monster Hunter sanded off some of the bumps I actually enjoyed in terms of overcoming real threats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things do ramp up a little bit in the post-game, but even there I’ve only really had to worry about upgrading my armor or falling behind in damage once or twice during the content that’s available at launch – and that includes against the tougher Tempered versions of monsters. After the 15 hours it took to beat the campaign, I only had to spend another 15 to finish every side quest (that wasn’t about catching fish), and just five more after that before I had the best armor set and weapon I wanted and a pretty solid suite of skill-boosting Decorations. To be fair, I still have plenty more equipment I <em>could</em> grind for, but my usual desire to get the top-tier weapon of each element type and put together specialized outfits for certain challenging fights just isn’t here this time – because those fights aren’t here to drive it. If I could already kill what is currently the hardest monster in Wilds quickly and without issue the very first time I encountered it, what am I supposed to be grinding for except the sake of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think a lot of this comes down to raw numbers that could hypothetically be tweaked in one of the many patches to come, but some of what makes things easier seems baked into the bones of Wilds. For example, nearly every time you Focus Strike a Wound, the monster gets locked into a short-but-substantial-enough stagger animation that provides a moment of advantage, and you’ll be breaking Wounds <em>a lot,</em> so those add up. Meanwhile, on the crafting side of things, my hunt for the best armor was way shorter than I ever expected because materials that are usually super rare can sometimes show up as guaranteed rewards when looking at the monster list on your map – and that version of that hunt can even then be saved and repeated up to three more times, letting you farm what is supposed to be the hardest-to-find item like it was a simple hide. That is excitingly convenient, but it’s also what brought that loot chase to an almost trivially fast end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The easier tuning will probably get more people through the door.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I imagine this difficulty tuning will get a lot more people through the front door, but it also means that where my past three Monster Hunter reviews wrapped up around the 50- to 60-hour mark while I still had plenty more I was excited to do, I started losing steam with Wilds before I even hit 40. (Even my time reviewing of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wild-hearts-review">Wilds Hearts</a> lasted longer than this.) Although, don’t get me wrong: there's still a healthy chunk of game here by almost any standard, and it has absolutely been some of the most fun I’ve had with the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also sure longtime fans will be reading this going, “Well, we just have to wait for updates/G-Rank/etc. for the real challenge.” But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-its-first-free-title-update-this-spring-adding-mizutsune">Capcom’s own update roadmap</a> has left me wary of how long that might take: There’s only <em>one</em> new monster announced for all of Spring, and then only one currently listed for Summer after that. In contrast, Rise also felt slight at launch, but got six new monsters just one month later, and then three more a month after that. Wilds already feels like it needs endgame threats like Monster Hunter's formidable Elder Dragons to really push its limits, and if instead it only ends up getting one returning monster in the first three-ish months after launch, this could be an impatient wait for its inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">Iceborne-</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-review">Sunbreak</a>-style expansion.</p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That all said, Wilds deserves credit for being one of the most customizable games I have played – not just in the Monster Hunter series, but anywhere. You can swap between two weapons on the fly while hunting, there’s a huge host of accessibility features, you can adjust the size of or turn off individual elements on your UI, you have more control than ever over your menus and radial wheels, and you can alter the look of minutiae like your mount, chat stickers, and even fast-travel tents to a surprising degree. As a crowning touch, you can finally wear any version of each armor set, essentially doubling the cosmetic options previously available as you get into the all-important fashion side of things toward the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Partying up online has also been made more robust, letting you run around each map with your friends (including through cross-play) and seamlessly flow from hunt to hunt, still getting full mission rewards without having to regroup at camp between each fight. And even if you’re largely planning to play solo, there are quality-of-life changes here for you, too – that could be the previously mentioned Support Hunters that fill empty spots in your party when you fire an SOS Flare (before being replaced by any real people who eventually answer the call), but also the inclusion of an “Online Single-Player” option that lets you fire Flares to get help but still pause the action entirely before you do. (That’s a trick we can hope FromSoftware learns for the next Souls game.)</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> about NetEase effectively pulling out of several of its investments out of China, fans of the promising action role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker were worried about its future. After all, developer Rebel Wolves did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> receiving an investment from NetEase in November 2022.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, this game&nbsp;<span>isn't in any danger, as Co-Owner and Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc clarified&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a> earlier today. NetEase is just a minority investor, and Rebel Wolves has already</span>&nbsp;found another publisher (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandai Namco</a>) for this game.</p>
<p><em>I've also read the articles suggesting that Rebel Wolves may be in danger due to the rumoured situation at NetEase. First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues.</em></p>
<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves.</em><br>
<em>NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founded by former developers of The Witcher 3</a>, the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> The Blood of Dawnwalker in mid-January, showing a promising title that blends a narrative focus with lots of player agency. In the game, players will take the role of Coen, a vampire from 14th century Carpathia who - as implied by the title - can also walk in the sun. Following the Black Death plague, his homeland has been invaded by a powerful coven of vampires, and it will be up to him to stop them and rescue his family. There will also be a time limit of thirty days and thirty nights to do so. The gameplay loop will be different at nighttime, with a more supernatural twist that shows off Coen's vampire powers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the players will have many choices to make in what the studio is calling a 'narrative sandbox'. Rebel Wolves did say not to expect a huge game in terms of scope and playtime like The Witcher 3, though, which is understandable given that it is a new studio. The game has no release date yet, but the developers will reveal more about The Blood of Dawnwalker later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newly-released demo for a little third-person mech shooter called&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is hitting some serious Steam player numbers, with hundreds of thousands of players flocking to check out the demo since it launched yesterday.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2870990/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo reached an all-time peak of 317,522 players yesterday. To put things into perspective, that's higher than the all-time Steam player counts of games like&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and we know <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">how successful the latter is</a>.</p>

<p>That achievement seems even more impressive when we consider that we're comparing a demo to numbers achieved by fully-released games. Sure, these aren't quite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>numbers</a>, but that's a franchise with some name recognition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=JTpOjlub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=-M67zZFV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mecha Break</em>'s demo is attracting some serious attention.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is getting some big player numbers for its demo, feedback from those players hasn't been entirely positive. In fact, the demo (which has its own review numbers thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos" rel="nofollow">changes made by Valve in July</a>) has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> across almost 4,800 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Those who've left negative reviews point to the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/xGCms/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, which is never a popular inclusion, as well as its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015327365/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetization model</a> and its lengthy, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976329976/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unskippable</a> tutorial sequence.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many positive reviews as well, and even negative reviews frequently mention&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>'s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061570971/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gameplay</a> as a positive point. Some players are also urging others to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ggwhiskey/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">show leniency</a> given that the demo doesn't necessarily represent the finished product.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>, it's a multiplayer third-person shooter with - you guessed it - an emphasis on mech combat.</p>

<p>The game offers three distinct modes: a 3v3 deathmatch mode, a 6v6 hero shooter-style mode, and a PvPvE extraction shooter. Needless to say, that's a pretty ambitious mix. It also boasts the involvement of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiplayer-mech-game-mecha-break-reveals-iconic-mecha-artists-and-beta-window" rel="nofollow">pretty heavy hitters in the mech world</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>'s Takayuki Yanase and&nbsp;<em>Gundam</em>'s Junya Ishigaki.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            Attention all eyeball eaters, flesh bicyclists, and shooter enjoyers who also enjoy staring into nightclub toilets! I’ve just noticed that survival horror FPS Golden Light is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245430/Golden_Light/">free to keep on Steam</a>… for the next hour only. The offer in question runs out at 6pm UTC today, 24th February. I swear I have only just discovered this. I swear I’m not trying to give you palpitations for the sake of a traffic spike. But if I am giving you palpitations, that’s an appropriate start to your time with Golden Light, “a procedural dark comedy horror game with roguelike elements and an eerie atmosphere”.
</p><p>Eerie? Do not sell yourself short, video game. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> is eerie. Golden Light is a game in which you can swallow a bat’s head just to see what happens. The last time I played I was murdered by a sink clog. The whole world is a deforming colon. Trailer! Quickly!</p><!--more-->

<p>Golden Light is also a particularly revolting take on the archetypal quest to save a damsel. As the game begins, you’re having a nice picnic with a woman known only as She. Suddenly, She is abducted, dismembered and sprinkled across the levels of a hideous meat dimension. Your job is to fight the bosses defending your beloved’s body parts and, well, it all gets very Eraserhead. It makes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> look like a book of Stephen Fry witticisms about his mother.</p>
<p>I’ve never reached the bottom of the labyrinth or found all the body parts, so can’t offer a conclusive verdict upon the precise overall disgustingness of Golden Light, but even the opening dungeon floors are ickier than most horror escapades. Layouts and weapons are procedural or randomised for maximum foulness. If you don’t know what something does, you can always eat it to experience the effects.</p>
<p>An acquired taste, Golden Light. Definitely the kind of thing you might prefer to sample for free, if you’re at all squeamish about fighting a soft cascade of deerheads or arming yourself with various designations of turd.</p>
<p>If it’s already past 6pm UTC when you read this and you’re all up in my comments thread, whinnying with rage about my less-than-punctuality, then calm down, calm down. Look, here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437570/Chambers/">demo</a> for developer Mr. Pink’s latest project Chambers, “a comedic RPG shooter set in the Weird Wild West”. I haven’t tried it yet but it looks slightly less repulsive. Slightly sunnier, at least.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll still spend a lot of your time exploring large, open locations, densely populated with secrets and side objectives, but there’s a more finite amount of content available in this adventure.</p><p>If you’re powering through <em>Avowed</em>’s main campaign with only limited investment in its optional content, you could likely see its credits in around <strong>20 hours</strong>. Doing so, however, would be skipping a lot of what makes the game such a special experience, and really missing out on half the game. There’s so much more to see and do in the gorgeous, colorful Living Lands of <em>Avowed</em>.</p><p>Indeed, <em>Avowed</em> is certainly not hurting for additional things to do for those who revel in absorbing as much of a game as possible. If you want to complete every side objective, find all of the chests and secrets, and do as much optional content as you can find in the Living Lands, you’re far more likely to land at a playtime of <strong>50+ hours</strong>. It’s fair to say that the average player, playing at a sensible pace, completing side-quests but not hunting down every last element, can expect the game to give them <strong>35 hours</strong> of fun. It’s notably shorter than many other games in the genre, but that can be a very welcome thing for those unable to sink hundreds of hours into an RPG.</p><p>Of course, you can stretch this considerably further by replaying the game and making different decisions than you did on your previous run. With multiple classes to play and dozens of unique endings available, there are potentially hundreds of hours worth of stuff to see for truly dedicated fans.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC. A PlayStation 5 version is rumored but not yet confirmed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re unsure when Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 will release, we’ve whipped up a handy hub with all the early details: Its likely start date, Verdansk coming back, and much more.</p>



<p>You only have to look at Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s player counts to realize Season 3 is the most important yet. Dwindling numbers and a lack of interest mean Activision needs to deliver. October and November 2025 saw Call of Duty’s Steam numbers exceed 300,000. Now, CoD is barely scraping together 100,000 players—and the count is falling more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3’s release may dictate the next six months. Let’s take a deep dive into the latest plans—including news of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning to Warzone</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-warzone-season-3-release-date">Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Verdansk dropping in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The end of the Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass tells us Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 likely commences on March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Most (if not all) live service games have a Battle Pass, and the majority have a countdown timer telling us how long the season has left. It’s the same case with Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass. If we go by its remaining days—and factor in every CoD season ever—then March 20 is the day of Season 3.</p>



<p>Maintenance or mishaps can get in the way of this. We’ll update this if we hear more or if Activision has a different plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-rumored-to-return-in-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-3">Verdansk Rumored to Return in Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 3</h2>



<p>Verdansk’s long-awaited return is the big news and easily the most anticipated addition in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. It’s been in the pipeline for months (daresay years) and <strong>Activision confirmed the news on Aug. 28, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>“Run it back. Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025,” said the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X account</a>. There’s still no official word on when it’s coming back, but all signs point to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning in Season 3</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about <em>which </em>version of Verdansk we’re potentially getting, you don’t need to. According to leaker TheGhostOfHope, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s pretty much the OG March 2020 version</a>.” </p>



<p>We’re checking socials every day for official word of Verdansk in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. Keep checking back for the latest updates and leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-season-3-leaks-roze-rumors">Season 3 Leaks—Roze Rumors</h2>



<p>There’s no roadmap so far, meaning this is purely speculative for now: But leaks suggest the <strong>infamous Roze skin</strong> is another dose of nostalgia for Season 3—along with other returning Operators and the usual seasonal content.</p>



<p>You’re lucky if you never had the displeasure of coming up against a user running the Roze skin, you’re lucky. The original Warzone’s Roze wore an all-black military suit that blended in with a lot of the environment. It eventually became seen as a pay-to-win skin as players were effectively being camouflaged—giving them the advantage in firefights.</p>



<p>Call of Duty news source <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detonated</a> claims: “Hudson, Roze, and Mace Operators are rumored to return in Black Ops 6, most likely with Season 3. It’s also fair to assume more maps, game modes, a new Battle Pass, and more Operators are on the way.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub with more details once we hear more.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s obvious Verdansk is the biggest talking point approaching Season 3. How do you feel about this? Will Black Ops 6 let the vintage Verdansk take the adulation and glory? Or are you not bothered and more interested to see how Black Ops 6 can bring players back? Let us know.</p>

                <p>The PEGI board has announced that it has reversed its decision to classify Balatro with a PEGI 18 rating and will instead have a PEGI 12 rating. The game has a E10+ rating in North America, making its original PEGI 18 classification in Europe strange.</p><p>As revealed in an update on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a>, Balatro's European publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing, successfully appealed the PEGI 18 classification. While the board originally classified the game as PEGI 18 due to explaining various poker hands, the more fantastical elements mitigated the "gambling" aspects and brought the rating down to PEGI 12.</p><p>Another game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord/" data-ref-id="5000-520128">Luck Be A Landlord</a>, also got its PEGI 18 rating reduced to PEGI 12. In this game, players can attempt to pay their rent by using a customizable slot machine and has similar roguelike gameplay elements as Balatro. Since Luck Be A Landlord had no specific gambling skills that could be transferred to the real world, the game was able to achieve its new rating classification.</p><p>However, the board said that any teaching or glamorization of simulated gambling will still result in a PEGI 18 rating.</p><p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorization of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls," the board explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-dev-clowns-on-pegi-ratings-criteria-as-games-with-actual-gambling-are-sold-to-kids/1100-6528491/" data-ref-id="1100-6528491">Developer LocalThunk</a> said that they didn't have a problem with the rating itself for Balatro, but pointed out that games like EA Sports FC have microtransactions and loot boxes while being classified as PEGI 3+, meaning "suitable for all ages."</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a>, a publisher with a stellar track record when it comes to quality releases, might have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">been in the news lately for its mass departures</a> and other strange business, but it's eager for everyone to know the show - or rather the showcase, in this particular instance - must go on. So here we are, with a closer look at its next slate of titles - some known, some new, but all looking intriguing for their own reasons. So if you're eager to see what's on the horizon for Annapurna and its talented development partners, read on...

<h3>Wheel World</h3>

<p>
If Wheel World looks familiar, that might be because it was initially unveiled under the name Ghost World back in 2023. But despite its new moniker, the fundamentals remain the same. Developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nidhogg">Nidhogg</a> studio Messhoff, it's a single-player open-world biking adventure with a touch of the supernatural - conjuring up a beautifully stylised world where players are free to simply putter around taking in the sights, or test their pedal mettle against quirky rivals and elite cycling teams. It looks a treat, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this "summer". And if that appeals, <a href="hhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/">there's a Steam demo now</a>.

<p>
Wanderstop, as you might already know, is first game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> co-creator Davey Wreden's Ivy Road studio. It's described as a "narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and while there's definitely a jaunty management aspect to it, Wanderstop seems equally concerned with exploring the emotional journey of its protagonist, Alta - a warrior who's somehow ended up running a teashop in a magical forest and is definitely not happy about it. It's an intriguing take on the often cloying cosy phenomenon, and we'll see how well it all works when Wanderstop launches for Xbox Series X/S, layStation 5, and PC on 11th March. And if you want to get stuck in sooner, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam demo's out now</a>.

<p>
It's been seven years since Thirty Flights of Loving developer Blendo Games' last release - VR strategy game Flotilla 2 - but the acclaimed studio is back with Skin Deep. Described as an "immersive first-person shooter [with] sneezing", Skin Deep follows the adventures of Nina Pasadena - once one of the galaxy's best assassins, now a lowly insurance commando. As Skin Deep begins, Nina's starship is raided by pirates, meaning players will need to "sneak, subvert, and sabotage", sandbox-style, across its non-linear interior to save the day. Oh, and you have no shoes. Skin Deep launches for PC on 30th April and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">demo's out now on Steam</a>.

<h3>Cocoon news and a brief tease</h3>
<p>
If you liked what Cocoon was popping in your ears when it released back in 2023 (subsequently becoming Eurogamer's Game of the Year), you might be thrilled to hear it's getting a vinyl soundtrack, reimagining its procedural music in more permanent form. There's also a Cocoon Collector's Edition incoming, AND developer Geometric Interactive has teased a new project that's being published by Annapurna Interactive. Details pretty much none existent right now, but the studio says it's unlike anything it's made before.

If you haven't already seen Lushfoil Photography Sim in motion, you should stop and watch its trailer right now. Developer Matt Newell has created some absolutely gorgeous environments for his freeform photography sim - little slice of real-world wilderness where players can complete objectives or simply explore and interact with the world.
</p>
<p>
There are kites to fly, bikes to ride, boats to row, and - of course - photos to snap across the crystalline lakes and forests of Italy, the sunset-lit beaches of South West Australia, the moody valleys of Southern Iceland, and more. You can even splash around in the Northern England rain if you fancy something closer to home. Lushfoil Photography Sim comes to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 15th April, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1749860/Lushfoil_Photography_Sim/">Steam demo's out now</a>.

<p>
Faraway, from developer Steph Thirion, is an "infinitely replayable immersive cosmic game" about a shooting star that wants to see the universe - which it does by whirling around, connecting stars, and creating constellations. It's a game of interstellar flinging that's designed to be as accessible as possible, only requiring a single button to play. But it also promises hidden depths, with talk of randomly generated stages to mix things up, score-multiplying loop-building, and other mechanical nuances. It's even got a couple of different puzzle modes too. Faraway doesn't have a release date yet but it coming to PC this year.

If you've been wondering what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has been up to recently, here's your answer. To a T, from Takahashi's Uvula studio, is a 3D narrative adventure focusing on Teen, a teenager trying to live their life in a small coastal town, despite being permanently stuck in a T-shape. Made in collaboration with AbleGamers, it follows Teen across several days as they find a way to fit in, gaining a newfound sense of self along the way. It's got unicycling, corn-eating, sunset-watching, silly mini-games, a colourful world to explore, and a "very cute dog". All this comes to Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on 28th May this year.

Who better to overcome a clique of killer cats than a cute little mouse with a peculiar deck of cards? That's the basic premise of Morsels, a top-down action-roguelite from developer Furcula that sees players traversing the dangerous upper worlds in order to bring down their feline oppressors. Those cards, in case you're wondering, have the power to transform into little monsters, which - when combined with the ability to switch between different characters at will - promises frenetic, endlessly replayable action. This one arrives later this year.

And finally! Developer Simogo's gorgeously dreamy arcade oddity <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> - officially a game about "riding motorcycles, skateboarding, dance battling, shooting lasers, wielding swords, and breaking hearts" - is coming to PS5 with a few new features. Its announcement referenced an "exclusive" unlockable game mode, high score battles in random stages, and other stuff - all of which is out today on PlayStation 5, and owners of the PlayStation 4 version can upgrade for free.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-starts-after-february-26-maintenance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next major update to Infinity Nikki will be coming soon and will launch after server maintenance takes place on February 26. The new season will launch on February 26 and will run until March 25, where players will be given the opportunity to explore the Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover all of the secrets that lay on the grounds. This comes in the form of a cursed song, and players will have to help out the legendary creature Bullquet in a sweet side quest. If you are interested in what the Eerie Season has to offer in Infinity Nikki, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The official trailer for Version 1.3 [Eerie Season] is now live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQG9MKHvB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Eerie Season will take players away from the vibrancy and pastel colors and instead transport them to a world filled with Gothic aesthetics, Supernatural phenomena, and new challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the ruins of Queen Philomia's palace, there have been peculiar singing voices that echo off of the walls of the palace, which has led people to believe that the ruins are cursed. Once the day turns to night, the melodies can be heard through the corridors, where the residents of Florawish have become unnerved and fear the grounds of the ruins. As a result of this, Nikki and Momo take a journey into the Queen's Palace Ruins, where there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The initial event will be named The Queen's Lament. Once players have completed this, they will then gain access to the Queen's Palace Ruins: Inner Court dungeon, which provides a new, scary challenge to take on.&nbsp; In addition, once players have cleared this dungeon, they will then be able to visit the high tower in the Queen's Palace Ruins at night, where they will be able to play the piano beside Ms. Glove.</p>
<p>Through the Eerie Season, players will be able to obtain 15 Revelation Crystals and a new outfit named the Dream Chaser completely for free. In the Heartfelt Gifts Store, there will be three more free outfits to obtain, which brings the grand total to nine free outfits throughout the history of Infinity Nikki. <a href="https://www.infoldgames.com/en/home#product">Infold Games</a> continues to be dedicated to the community of Infinity Nikki, and continues to work to optimize the game and ensure that players are having a good time playing the game, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-available-to-wishlist-on-steam/">title set to soon release</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience the Gothic and supernatural beauty of Eerie Season once it is released after the maintenance on February 26, where the season will then run until March 25.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-the-kotaku-review.1117260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A giant rooster that sets a desert sea on fire every time it brushes its beautiful but deadly tail feathers. A toad-like octopus that sends mini-tidal waves roiling through a thick jungle forest as it flops around like a violent puppy. These and other majestic creatures I’ve killed dozens of times in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and I would gladly do it again.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em>’s greatest trick has always been making ecological slaughter feel so engaging, necessary, and urgent that players repeat the same tasks with slight variations for dozens of hours on end. Instead of being bored or exhausted, the endless, vicious cycle leaves us exhilarated and rejuvenated. Slicing rare horns, hides, and relics from fallen prey for the 100th time leaves us not with an existential crisis but with a fresh grin on our face. </p><p>That magic is as alive and cleverly engineered as ever in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The blockbuster sequel, out February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, presents Capcom’s long-running action-RPG series at its most visually impressive and intricately designed yet, with striking vistas transformed on a dime by sudden storms and beasts of all shapes, sizes, and temperaments living in them. It takes players to the Forbidden Lands to research a previously unexplored region that’s home to new monsters, mysterious weather events, and the remnants of an ancient civilization. </p><p>It’s a massive undertaking full of sprawling maps to explore and some of the coolest boss fights in modern gaming. I’ve had a blast giving myself over to its mesmerizing reward loop, and it’s a game I will continue playing a ton of in the future. At the same time, the few dozen hours I’ve spent with  <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> so far have left me slightly disappointed at just how familiar and unsurprising it all feels. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is a comprehensive visual and combat spectacle that still is still very much a <em>Monster Hunter </em>game, often for better but occasionally for worse.</p><p>It doesn’t feel like the <em>Monster Hunter</em> of the future so much as the super ultra deluxe version of the series as we know it today. Its bells and whistles are mostly quality-of-life improvements, and the splendor of its world is richly layered but more subtle than it’s been in the past. The formula of 1.) find monster, 2.) kill monster, 3.) turn it into cool stuff has been streamlined within an inch of its life, both to deliver the franchise’s core pleasures in rapid, breakneck succession, and also perhaps in a bid to make an infamously dense, arcane, and overwhelming series more hospitable than ever to newcomers. </p><p>The big back-of-the-box innovation this time around is a more seamless  world. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is divided into a series of large open zones. These biomes, from icy caverns to volcanic pits, become characters in their own right as you spend hours combing through them for your quarry and crafting resources. Traveling between these areas involves astoundingly brief loading screens. More importantly, players can travel between their camps and the hunting zones themselves without any loading screen at all, engaging in quests one after the other without constantly being forced to hop back and forth. </p><p><br>You can even cook up meals—an important preparation technique for getting battle-enhancing status buffs—mid-mission now. It is both ridiculously absurd and absurdly satisfying to break out the grill 25 feet away from the dragon-like Rathalos, fry up some fish, and watch my hunter’s eyes briefly glaze over with foodie pleasure before she needs to rapidly dodge away from the incoming beast’s attacks.</p><p> The actual “hunting” part of the series is more nonexistent than ever. Playing through the campaign, I simply selected quests from a menu and then immediately bee-line toward my objective. Finding monsters while simply roaming around environments is equally a breeze. They’ll pop up on a 3D map bursting with icons on which all of their movements can be followed with drone-like surveillance precision. Selecting them gives the option to turn them into quests and then be guided to them automatically by new mounts called Seikrets. The frictionlessness of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>can be liberating, but it also feels like a missed opportunity. </p><p>Man, do I love my Seikret though. The galloping bird, a cross between a raptor and an ostrich, feels better to ride than any horse I’ve ever encountered in an open-world game. It’s superbly animated and controls with just enough imprecision and lag to make it feel like you’re actually riding something while gracefully leaping over most impediments in the environment without ever losing speed or getting snagged. While this can make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ world feel smaller and less intimidating, it’s a great way to show off its grandeur. Zipping up tree vines and down sand dunes turns  drudgery into a theme park ride as I rapidly pick up resources scattered around the ground along the way. </p><p>To the degree that the Seikret is the star of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it shines most during battle. It can serve as a springboard for hopping onto monsters’ backs or quickly pull you up off the ground right after you get clobbered. Its saddle bag contains not just supplies that let you restock important items, but also a second weapon you can take with you wherever you go. Tired of that slow bulldozer of a hammer? Switch to dual blades completely change up the rhythm of a fight in an instant. Or pair a long blade with a heavy bow gun to switch between short-range attacks and long-range damage. More options, less hassle is one of the mantras animating <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. <br></p><p><br>I spent much most of my time with my tried-and-true greatsword, opting for an iconic <em>Monster Hunter </em>archetype that hits like a jet engine but moves much more slowly. The lack of speed is meant to balance out its high damage potential, yet it also reinforces the natural physics of a six-foot person trying to swing around an eight-foot broadsword. I can feel my hunter’s muscles burning under the weight of a missed double swing as she tries to pick the weapon back up off the dirt, each frame meticulously animated to look at home in the world and also convey to me, the player, that I need to aim better.</p><p>Details like this add up to make the moment-to-moment combat in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> rewarding and entertaining long-past its sell-by date. It’s chunky yet fluid, like a delicious soup of high-stakes creature looting. Hitting the same spot on a monster over and over yields wounds that can be targeted with new cinematic focus attacks to deal extra damage and earn extra rewards. The game’s 14 weapons each have their own focus attacks, which were reason enough for me to experiment with ones I wouldn’t have otherwise tried like the Insect Glaive. </p><p>Hopping off the Seikret and onto a monster’s back turns encounters into <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> for a moment, as you move up and down the creature’s spine to avoid being shaken off while stabbing it to create new wounds. Combine it all with shock traps, pitfalls, exploding barrels, and other players and you have a recipe for making my sixth knock-down, drag-out fight against the roaring lion bear hybrid Doshaguma<strong>&nbsp;</strong>something I wish I were doing  right this second.</p><p> Story has never been <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s strong point and none of this is propelled along by compelling drama or intriguing mysteries. The characters this time around are charming and dutifully carry out their roles, but rarely rise beyond the level of glorified quest giver or exposition vehicle. A journey to reunite a strange child with his secret tribe who are being terrorized by an unknown “White Wraith” is aggressively predictable at every turn. All of it is briskly paced and does an admirable job of table setting for the endgame in which players are meant to spend the majority of their time, even if it much of it still feels like a formality before the “real game” begins in the back half. <br></p><p><br>This post-game that opens up after the credits roll introduces the “higher ranks” at which players get to hunt stronger versions of the monsters they’ve already encountered, including new Tempered and Frenzied variants which contain even more unique materials necessary for crafting additional sets of armor and weapons. I’ve only scratched the surface of this loot chase, and all I can say is that I’m looking forward to excavating it as deeply and completely as my time allows. This high-end gear bestows bonuses and enables strategies for taking on the game’s toughest bosses and, more importantly, it looks really cool. Fashion is the low-key driver of the series’ grim in-game economy, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has the drip.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter</em> has always traded in eye-popping scale, and the latest sequel carries on that tradition. But it hasn’t done so at the expense of depth, or at least the feeling of depth. Some video-game world simulations feel paper thin with the machinery poking through at the seams. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ feels naturalistic and multi-layered. I’ve spent most of my time with it so far tangling with its largest creatures, but the wildlife is much more extensive than that, and so subtly executed that it’s easily missed while you’re focused on chasing down giant sandworms and oily wyverns. Smaller herds of giant possums, flocks of birds, and families of river lizards abound, occasionally asserting themselves when you least expect it. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is at its most beautiful and chaotic when all the elements and residents of its dynamic world accidentally collide; multiple monsters locked in a turf war as smaller creatures scurry around, some trying to escape, others following their pack leader into the action, all while hunters set exploding traps and raging storms pass through before eventually breaking into daylight. I wish all of this were  integrated into the harder, better, stronger, faster logic at the heart of the game’s RPG progression in more sophisticated ways, but that liveliness does inject more life and zeal into a very familiar pattern, one that still works and now feels more robust than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft’s plans for its new Muse AI technology for video games appears to be ready to move into full gear. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is getting ready to start training its new AI system on a “catalog of games”.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Dwarkesh Patel Podcast—h/t to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-train-its-gaming-ai-on-a-catalogue-of-titles-soon-satya-nadella-says-and-then-start-playing-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>—Nadella says that the plan is to train the AI system on games so that it can actually start playing them.</p>



<p>“When&nbsp;Phil Spencer&nbsp;first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game,” Nadella said.</p>



<p>“That to me is a massive, massive moment of ‘wow’. It’s kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as how this ability and training will help with game development and gamers, in general, Nadella didn’t go into any specifics. </p>



<p>According to Microsoft’s announcement of Muse, not only does it have the potential to assist with game development and accessibility, but it could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-technology-could-help-game-preservation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with game preservation</a> as well.</p>



<p>The idea of AI in gaming continues to be a much discussed topic. Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam users began requesting</a> the ability to filter out games that use generative AI. Even CEO’s have gotten in on the topic with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick believing</a> that there’s truly no such thing as “artificial intelligence”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft using games to train its AI model to play them? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

TESRenewal, the modding group working on the project, made the announcement in a new gameplay video showcasing some of Oblivion's upgraded cities, but the team said they still don't have an anticipated release date yet. It'll just be sometime in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Making games takes time, this goes double for a volunteer project the size of a AAA game that took a team of full-time devs years to make," the group said, echoing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">similar statement made in 2023</a>.

In addition to improved lighting and assets at higher resolutions, TESRenewal added a new leveling system, changed boss encounters, altered enemy scaling, and even expanded locations. They've also made it possible for Oblivion's classes and spellcrafting to work in Skyrim's engine and have incorporated fan feedback throughout development.</p><p dir="ltr">Work on some of Oblivion's cities remains incomplete, but TESRenewal said that bug fixes and optimization are their main priorities in the coming months. When Skyblivion does launch, its updates will apply to the entirety of Oblivion, including all side quests and locations. Skyblivion itself will be free, though TESRenewal said you'll have to own Skyrim: Special Edition, Oblivion, and all of Oblivion's DLC for the Skyblivion installer to work. Oblivion and its DLC are available on Steam.</p>

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify it as PEGI 18 and has now been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p>
<p>About a year ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">developer Localthunk commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'", stating "it is what it is".</p>

<p>"The PEGI 18 rating for the game Balatro has been changed to a PEGI 12 following a successful appeal submitted by publisher Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing," the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) organisation announced on its <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">website</a> earlier today.</p>
<p>"The Complaints Board concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating."</p>
<p>Similarly, Luck Be A Landlord has also been reclassified as PEGI 12.</p>
<p>"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," the ratings board stated.</p>
<p>"On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."</p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has revealed the upcoming content roadmap for Black Desert in the month of March, where the game will receive its first-ever Hardcore Server, alongside the final chapter of the Atoraxxion storyline, Orzekea, and some major quality-of-life improvements that will make the Black Desert experience much more enjoyable for those who play it.</p>
<p>Black Desert has had some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">major updates</a> as of late, with the most recent expansion for the game being released five months ago, introducing players to medieval Korea.</p>
<p>If you want to hear the developers talking about what is due to come in Black Desert, make sure to check out the Developer's Latest Update video below, where there is a 15-minute video dedicated to each of the major updates coming to the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer’s Latest Updates (feat. Hardcore Server, Orzekea) | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OTgckE5xbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First, the Hardcore Server will be launching on March 13 for Black Desert, with the server shaping up to be the ultimate PvP experience, where players will have to try and survive as long as they possibly can while accumulating points by defeating monsters and taking down other players. Compared to other games, the content in the Hardcore Server is only playable for two hours a day. The points that the player accumulates can then be used to obtain generous rewards to praise your success in the game.</p>
<p>On March 20, the final chapter of the Atoraxxion storyline will be making its way into Black Desert. The chapter is titled Orzekea, and will take players on an adventure through the mysteries of Orze, who has been a pivotal character in the Atoraxxion conflict. With this comes some major plot twists to the story, with its final boss, 'Orze of Thorns bringing a new challenge to players, where they will have to team up to overtake the boss together and bring an end to the storyline.</p>
<p>While there isn't a set date for when the cosmetics and quality of life updates will be added to the game, new cosmetic outfits for players to experiment with are confirmed to arrive next week. The <a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Main/Index?_region=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Black Desert website</a> is likely to be updated with when the outfits are due to be released in the game.</p>
<p>The Medeia outfit will be available for those who play female characters. This outfit comes with a mysterious, creepy witch theme, while the Sunny Breeze costume will be available for all classes, ringing in the upcoming Spring season with a vibrant and floral aesthetic.</p>
<p>Along with all of these major updates for March, Black Desert will also be receiving an All-in-One Preset feature. When this is released, players will then be given the option to customize their settings for different types of gameplay in Black Desert, allowing players to toggle the settings they need by applying the necessary preset.</p>
