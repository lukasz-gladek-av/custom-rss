		<p>TerraTech Legion rolls into the enemy-infested wastelands, guns blazing, electricity arcing and explosives… exploding all around. A fresh take on the bullet heaven style, it’s inherently addictive and satisfying to put together successful runs filled with screen-clearing chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="TerraTech Legion | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnooYvvu-vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s still a good way to go, from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729960/TerraTech_Legion_Demo/">what’s shown in the demo</a> through to a fully fleshed-out release, but the core experience is already solid and shows plenty of potential.</p>


<p>Any time there’s a new genre and game style emerging, there’s bound to be imitators and clones. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivor">Vampire Survivor</a> remains a sensation to this day, constantly updated and with mini expansions, but as it leans into its retro style and amusing jank, there’s so much scope and potential for other developers and gaming universes to riff off its ideas and feel different.</p>
<p>For TerraTech Legion, that’s in driving a vehicle from a top-down view, with all the tricks that this lends in manoeuvring around enemies and obstacles. With turning circles accelerating and potentially quite cumbersome and lumbering handling for a beefy vehicle, you need to pilot in a more considered way.</p>


<p>And then there’s the vehicle construction element, which is adapted from TerraTech proper. You start with a pre-formed vehicle, with dozens of attachment points on the top, sides and rear to bolt weapons and augmentations onto, but after even just a few of these are awarded, you might start to feel constrained, needing to bolt extra surfaces or extension arms onto your vehicle to gain more space. It’s a fun and easy to grasp vehicle builder, items snapping into place to those mounting points.</p>
<p>But how do you get those new upgrades? As is typical for this genre, you need to collect gems that are dropped by fallen enemies, filling up a bar that then heralds an upgrade crate to give you a choice of three new weapons. You can also pick up augment crates dropped by enemies that are then opened as you reach this level up stage. This is also the point at which you get to add things to your vehicle, and you’re given freedom to tear everything back down and reconfigure it to match a new or evolving plan for your build. Need more space for guns? Perhaps sticking augment modules underneath extra blocks will give you more topside space?</p>

<p>There’s a few different ways that you can play, a handful of different damage types with multiple different weapons that let you combine them with buffs and upgrades, or you can lean in on kinetic damage and crash through hordes with hefty boosts. It took one run for me to really figure out my successful strategy, bolting a whole battery of miniguns and railguns pointing to the side, backed up by some more general weapons covering the other sides. The key thinking to this was that it would allow me to effectively strafe around the main hordes of enemies and bosses, while forward or rear-facing weapons forced me hand to less-desirable driving style, and omni-directional weapons have less oomph.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, this was exceptionally satisfying, with the railguns giving a bit of range before the miniguns could open up as enemies get within range, just spewing out bullets in an angry hum of metal. With a bunch of ballistic damage boosters attached, I could make short work of pretty much everything, barring the bosses.</p>

<p>The demo level has two bosses on show, which throw a little bit of bullet hell back your way. A large, bulbous mid-boss appears partway through and repeatedly lifts off and lands before sending out waves of energy projectiles that you need to dodge –&nbsp;which is no mean feat when also dealing with a large sweep of regular enemies! –&nbsp;while the level ending boss summoned glowing orange orbs for enemies to spawn from, as well as sending out laser beams to cordon you in for a short time. They’re decent bosses, though it’s often a bit tricky to figure out in the latter boss has its beams at ground level when it’s moving around. I definitely want to see more variety in the full game, and more challenging attack patterns.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a demo, so there’s plenty that’s missing and promised for the full release of TerraTech Legion. More starter vehicles, more biomes, more enemies and bosses, and an emerging metagame that taps into all the resources you can collect while playing. I’d also like to see more emphasis put on specialising down different weapon types and damage synergies, where it currently feels like I can be a bit too general with my choices. This is a solid starting point, though, a vehicle core which Payload Studios can bolt more ideas onto, and I’m keen to see more.</p>

<figure><a title="AC4: Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fec5502d77b4d/ac4-black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours of an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_rebel_collection">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> remake have been circulating for quite a while now, but the latest hint comes from a pretty credible source: actor Matt Ryan, who played the game's protagonist Edward Kenway.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-says-fans-may-have-to-beat-the-game-again-as-remake-rumours-mount/">VGC</a>, Ryan was signing merchandise at a recent convention when he casually asked a fan whether they had completed Black Flag. After confirming that they had done so, Ryan said "well you might have to beat it again", before smirking.</p>

<p>He wouldn't elaborate much further, but simply stated "There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything".</p>
<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that he's probably referring to the rumoured Black Flag remake, and Ubisoft itself has even confirmed its willingness to revisit previously-released games and modernise them for current hardware.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zmikvn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Black Flag previously launched on both the Wii U and the Switch (the latter as part of the Rebel Collection) and has proven to be one of the most beloved entries in Ubisoft's flagship franchise. To be honest, we would have expected a remake of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/assassins_creed_ii">Assassin's Creed 2</a> long before the fourth entry, but we can't complain.</p>
<p>Either way, we reckon there's a good chance this will turn up on the Switch 2. It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> would also make its way to Nintendo's new console following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">an online rating</a>, but at the time of writing, there's been no official confirmation.</p>

The number of concurrent players has dropped so rapidly that Wilds' predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-wont-stop-buying-monster-hunter-world/1100-6529492/" data-ref-id="1100-6529492">Monster Hunter World</a>, has a higher count. Today, Capcom is attempting to address PC players' issues as part of the massive Free Title Update 2. The publisher has also shared a glimpse at the next two free updates beyond this one.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAf4Z4rCpK4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GAf4Z4rCpK4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Free Title Update 2 doesn't make any changes to Wilds' minimum or recommended system requirements, the Steam version has been adjusted to amount of VRAM used in texture streaming to lower the amount of VRAM overall. One of the bug fixes will also make the Estimated VRAM Usage display the correct amount in Display Settings and Graphics Settings.</p><p>It's too soon to say whether these changes alone will turn things around for Wilds on Steam, but Capcom notes that further performance and optimization improvements are still in the works. Across all platforms, Free Title Update is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-lagiacrus-seregios-and-underwater-combat/1100-6532767/" data-ref-id="1100-6532767">adding two new monsters</a>, Lagiacrus and Seregios, as well as underwater combat.</p><p>Some of the smaller changes in this update include easier access to the map, which can now be opened even when major chat notifications are on the screen. Wilds will no longer be automatically switching to area hierarchy when players are focused on the large monsters on the map.</p><p>Weapon balance changes have been made for Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun, with more adjustments to be added in August. Looking ahead to Free Title Update 3, Capcom expects to release it in September with a new level of quest difficulty with unique rewards which can be used for a new Talisman crafting system. The Talismans can be "assigned a wide variety of skills," including some related directly to weapons and armor. Free Title Update 4 will follow in the winter with another new monster and "more challenging elements."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1938591901378040197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">[Future Update Plans]<br>So far, we have discussed what we will be addressing in the second Free Title Update, however we feel there are still many points of feedback and requests to address.

The other half is fending off a parade of increasingly absurd, terrifying, and sometimes outright beautiful bosses, not to mention reaping the rewards of defeating them. From bouncing blue blobs to cosmic eldritch horrors, this guide covers every major boss fight in the sidescroller, whether you’re playing on PC, console, or mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">Breaking down all Terraria bosses in order, you’ll spot summoning tips, combat strategies, and info on the drops you'll receive. You'll encounter some beasts naturally as you go about your peaceful mining expedition, while others require a bit of know-how with summon items.</p><p dir="ltr">Be warned, this guide contains spoilers, just in case you’d prefer to go into these battles blind. And, for the love of Torch God, make sure you’re decked out in the right weapons and accessories before you go picking a fight with the hardest Terraria bosses at the end of the list.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode_Bosses">Pre-Hardmode Bosses</a><ul><li><a href="#King_Slime__Optional_">King Slime (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></li><li><a href="#Eater_of_Worlds__Corruption_only_">Eater of Worlds (Corruption only)</a></li><li><a href="#Brain_of_Cthulhu__Crimson_only_">Brain of Cthulhu (Crimson only)</a></li><li><a href="#Queen_Bee">Queen Bee</a></li><li><a href="#Skeletron">Skeletron</a></li><li><a href="#Deerclops">Deerclops</a></li><li><a href="#Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode_Bosses">Hardmode Bosses</a><ul><li><a href="#Queen_Slime__Optional_">Queen Slime (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#The_Twins">The Twins</a></li><li><a href="#The_Destroyer">The Destroyer</a></li><li><a href="#Skeletron_Prime">Skeletron Prime</a></li><li><a href="#Plantera">Plantera</a></li><li><a href="#Golem">Golem</a></li><li><a href="#Empress_of_Light__Optional_">Empress of Light (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Duke_Fishron__Optional_">Duke Fishron (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Lunatic_Cultist">Lunatic Cultist</a></li><li><a href="#Moon_Lord__Final_Boss_">Moon Lord (Final Boss)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode_Bosses">Pre-Hardmode Bosses</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="King_Slime__Optional_">King Slime (Optional)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519203" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519203"></a><figcaption>King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg"></figure><p>A giant, jiggly blob with a crown and a penchant for teleportation. King Slime is often your first real test of boss combat and crowd control. Despite its size, it is one of the most mobile bosses at this stage, frequently teleporting to close the gap when players run too far away. The more you damage it, the smaller King Slime gets, until it resembles the ordinary slimes that bother you in your day-to-day adventures.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use a Slime Crown or</p><p dir="ltr">World: Wait for a Slime Rain event or take your chances on the grassy areas on the outer rim of the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 2,000 on Classic / 2,800 on Expert / 3,570 on Master.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 40 on Classic / 64 on Expert / 96 on Master.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Keep your distance and stay mobile. Ranged and magic weapons work best early on. You can even abuse King Slime's teleportation mechanic by running off-screen and trapping it in nooks. Later on in the game, when you have access to more equipment, you can craft traps such as lava pits using a lava bucket, or take a page out of Obi-Wan’s book and use Rocket Boots or Wings to gain the high ground over your opponent. If you’re going after King Slime with a group, make sure you spread out to avoid him teleporting directly on top of your group.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Slime Gun, Slime Hook, Ninja armour pieces, Solidifier, Slimy Saddle mount, Mask, Trophy</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Nothing special happens after defeating King Slime, as it’s an optional boss.</p><h3 id="Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519199" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519199"></a><figcaption>Eye of Cthulhu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg"></figure><p>The gateway horror of Terraria. If you hear roaring at night, you’re about to get your eyeballs handed to you. This flying monstrosity starts off with lazy circular attack patterns that ignore blocks as if they’re nothing, and summons Servants of Cthulhu for a helping hand. Once you whittle it down to below half health (or under 65% health in Expert+), Eye of Cthulhu transforms into a toothy nightmare with ramped-up aggression, switching to wild charges. At this point, it’s defenseless but deals higher damage, ditching numbers in favour of a one-on-one fight.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use a Suspicious Looking Eye at night.</p><p dir="ltr">World: One in three chance of spawning at night once you have three NPCs in housing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 2,800 on Classic / 3,640 on Expert / 4,641 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 15 on Classic / 30 on Expert / 45 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Prepare ahead of time by creating an arena and setting up plenty of light sources. As with any nighttime boss, the sooner you start the fight after sunset, the more time you have to get the job done before Eye of Cthulhu disappears. Dodge its charge attacks and whittle it down with bows or wands. The second phase is faster, so be ready to dash or grapple away. Any accessories that boost movement speed (like the Hermes Boots) are a game-changer here.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Demonite/Crimtane Ore, Unholy Arrows, Mask, Trophy, Binoculars.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Defeating Eye of Cthulhu allows Dryad to move in and gives the Traveling Merchant a chance to sell a yoyo called Code 1 for five gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eater_of_Worlds__Corruption_only_">Eater of Worlds (Corruption only)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519198" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519198"></a><figcaption>Eater of Worlds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg"></figure><p>A segmented worm that tunnels through your nightmares and your base. The Eater of Worlds battle is a fight of endurance and control, where the wrong move can split the boss into a mess of deadly, individual threats if you aren’t careful. It will only spawn in worlds with Corruption, which is one of two evil biomes, alongside Crimson. Both cannot co-exist, leaving you with a 50/50 chance of fighting this burrowing beast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong>:</p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use Worm Food in a Corruption biome.</p><p dir="ltr">World: Destroy 3 Shadow Orbs in a Corruption biome.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 7,500 on Legacy builds / 10,050 on Classic / 15,120 on Expert / 19,224 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Equip yourself with piercing or area-of-effect (AoE) weapons like Vilethorn or grenades for large amounts of damage to the entire worm. Lure Eater of Worlds to a surface-built arena designed to give you more manoeuvrability. Aim for body segments, preferably the head or tail, to avoid splitting it early. If you destroy the middle section, it will split into two monsters that’ll attack you separately. Multiple players can take out separate segments faster--just don’t let your allies get overwhelmed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Shadow Scales, Demonite Ore, Eater's Bone, Mask, Trophy</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Eater of Worlds is a primary source of materials you need to progress, but there is a possibility you can accrue enough Demonite naturally throughout the world to move onto the next stages without fighting it.</p><h3 id="Brain_of_Cthulhu__Crimson_only_">Brain of Cthulhu (Crimson only)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519195" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519195"></a><figcaption>Brain of Cthulhu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg"></figure><p>The squishier, trickier cousin to the Eater of Worlds, Brain of Cthulhu leans heavily on illusion and misdirection. The fight opens with a swarm of Creepers that must be cleared before the real battle begins, and the brain’s teleporting, duplicating phase two can catch unprepared players off guard.

She darts across the screen, spewing stingers and summoning swarms of bees to overwhelm the player. Despite her elegance, she’s a deadly gatekeeper to Jungle loot and late Pre-Hardmode gear. This one stings in several ways. Not only can it be a tough brawl, but you can’t help but feel like the villain when she’s only trying to avenge her larva and defend her home.

Build a long platform so you can jump over her sweeping charges and use ranged weapons so you too can float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.

Skeletron is a classic boss with a two-part hitbox: You’ll need to deal with flailing arms before the real damage begins on the head. His spinning attack can rip through unprepared players, so practice your dodging beforehand. Worse yet, you’re on a time limit in this battle, as you’ll need to get the job done before sunrise, lest you meet the swift hand of the undead that’ll kill you with one fell swoop.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong>:</p><p dir="ltr">Item: Defeat the Clothier with the Clothier Voodoo Doll equipped at night.</p><p dir="ltr">World: Talk to the Old Man at the Dungeon entrance at night.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 4,400 (600 per hand) on Classic / 8,800 (1,560 per hand) on Expert / 11,220 (1,989 per hand) on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 32 (20 per hand) on Classic / 70 (44 per hand) on Expert / 105 (66 per hand) on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: As with most bosses in the game, it pays to lay down some floating platforms to give you room to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge. It’s easy enough to see Skeletron's attacks coming with predictable lunges, but timing can be tough due to both arms flailing at once. Get hit and you’ll start bleeding, which leaves you unable to heal from your wounds. Your job is to focus on the hands first, then the head.

This can be particularly time-consuming as you syphon lava out of the way, but you’ll need as long of a bridge as you can build because this Cronenberg colossus will chase you from one side of the screen to the other, starting from the direction you threw the Voodoo Doll into the lava.

We recommend taking out Spazmatism first (identifiable by its green iris) as the cursed flames do the most damage. When each eye reaches 40% of its health, it transforms into a more aggressive version that fires faster, and you ideally don’t want both on their second stage simultaneously. Designing a minecart track or getting hold of some wings for mobility helps in this fight tremendously.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Souls of Sight, Hallowed Bars, Twin Mask, mechanical-themed trophies and gear</p><p><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Defeating any mechanical boss for the first time will prompt the Steampunker NPC to move in.

            <p>The latest UK charts for physical video game sales are here. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has - perhaps unsurprisingly - taken the top spot, according to data for the week ending 28th June. This has seen Kojima Production's cinematic and widely praised release bump <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> down a place, to number two.</p>
<p>While Death Stranding 2 was indeed the top selling game last week physically, according to The Game Business' <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1939386768211509434">Chris Dring</a> these debut sales were 66 percent lower than that of the original Death Stranding game. This is largely due to the current market being more digital-focused.</p>
<p>To compare further, Dring stated Death Stranding 2's physical sales were 33 percent lower than fellow PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> had on its release. Of course, the two games are clearly targeted at quite different audiences.</p>

            <p>I have thus far in my life avoided playing any factory automation games because I only ever see them recommended in the same breath as dire warnings and laments. "Play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/infinifactory">Infinifactory</a>! It ruined my life! ", "I now exclusively play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/opus-magnum">Opus Magnum</a> inside the skip that is now my home after my family kicked me out. 10/10!", etc etc. But the way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/number-machine">Number Machine</a>'s extendo-arm hex pushes sets of tiles has awakened something in me. Taking a sprawling genre and making it tiny and a bit pastel is basically a genre unto itself now but one I'm a supporter of. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>"Number Machine is an open-ended factory and automation game with math mechanics," touts the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231090/Number_Machine">Steam page</a>. "Move, combine, split, destroy, and modify numbered orbs with math to form the required structures with specific shapes and values". Maths, you say? Ah, but look at the little pushy arm go! "Use conveyors, pushers, lasers, magnetism, rotators, and much more to create an efficient system". See, now you're speaking my language, and it's a language that was shaped, moulded and tempered in the white-hot crucible of 1990's puzzler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine">The Incredible Machine</a>.</p>
<p>This one is from Arielek, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1383250/Please_Fix_The_Road">Please Fix The Road</a> fame. We've never covered it, but a lot of other outlets did and enjoyed it, based on the happy little Steam quotes. Eurogamer even slapped a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/please-fix-the-road-is-a-polite-yet-fiendish-little-puzzle-game">'recommended' sticker on it</a> - a veritable 'triple sumptuous' on the EG scale. Number Machine is due out sometime next year.

<figure><a title="MK World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4407c0e8e83ba/mk-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following Nintendo's most recent update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, it seems a small minority of fans are expressing their disappointment in the only way they know how: by review bombing the game on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-kart-world/user-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-kart-world-review-bombing-metacritic-user-score-plummeting/">The Gamer</a>, Mario Kart World's user review average has dropped from around 8.3 to 7.5 in just a handful of days (and its also worth noting that The Gamer had it at 7.7 just a couple of days ago, so the score is still dropping as we speak).</p>
<p>Nintendo's recent update made it much harder for online players to randomly select standard 3-lap courses, instead putting more emphasis on the so-called 'intermission' races that make use of the game's new open world. 3-lap courses are still available, but the probability of them showing up is now much lower.</p>
<p>A lot of fans still value the traditional 3-lap races, so we can understand the frustration to a certain degree, but we're not sure reviewing the game and awarding it a score of... hang on... yep, <em>0/10</em> is the right answer. Hey, if it gets Nintendo to listen, then fair play – maybe that's the goal.</p>
<p>We've no doubt Mario Kart World will continue to receive updates way into the future, and we're confident Nintendo will ultimately provide enough options to keep all fans happy and content. For now, however, its decisions are definitely leading some to vent their anger online. One video even said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fans-reckon-nintendo-has-killed-mario-kart-world-with-its-latest-update">Nintendo had "killed" the game with the latest update</a>. Yikes.</p>

<p>Despite the controversy, we still think Mario Kart World is a pretty darn good game. We awarded it a score of 9/10 and said it "refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has been practically confirmed by Matt Ryan, who voiced protagonist Edward Kenway in the original game. </p>



<p>Ryan, who also played DC's John Constantine in various live action and animated shows, spontaneously <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/1939392046151926243">told</a> a fan the following when signing autographs at a convention:</p>



<p><em>Have you beaten the game? Well, you may have to beat it again. Especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything.</em></p>



<p>The first time we heard about the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake was exactly two years ago, when Kotaku <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-rumor-skull-and-bones-dev/">reported</a> that Ubisoft planned to modernize the fourth mainline installment in the series, originally launched in 2013. Interestingly, that report also mentioned that Ubisoft Singapore would be helping the Montréal studio in crafting the remake. This makes sense, as Black Flag's excellent naval combat and exploration mechanics inspired Ubisoft Singapore's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull and Bones</a> game.</p>



<p>In October 2024, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">revealed</a> that the project was even further in development than previously thought. Ubisoft originally planned for Assassin's Creed Shadows to be released in late 2024 and the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake in November 2025, but the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 2025 also impacted the remake, which is now likely to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Even so, we might not be far from an official announcement, especially with Matt Ryan teasing it so openly. Chances are it may be revealed at a dedicated Ubisoft event or, more likely, between Gamescom Opening Night Live and The Game Awards 2025 in December.</p>



<p>How excited are you for the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>Interestingly, however, it seems physical sales for DS2 are down 66% when compared to the first game, according to The Game Business' <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1939386768211509434">Chris Dring</a>. It's a much different world we live in now, of course, so it's likely that there are simply far more digital sales this time around.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Nightdive Studios' excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a> made its charts debut at number seven following its recent physical release, and if you've not checked out that game yet, we'd highly recommend doing so. The physical sold way better on the PS5, admittedly, which isn't entirely surprising given that it benefits from a buttery-smooth 120fps on Sony's platform.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

		<p>Ace Combat is 30 years old having released in 1995, and Bandai Namco is marking the 30th anniversary with a couple of things. The publisher has released a commemorative video that celebrates the franchise, announced an orchestra concert, a controller and even teased a brand new game in the series though no concrete details have been revealed. There is a message from Kazutoki Kono, the brand director for Ace Combat, where the game is teased. You can read his statement after the video.</p>
<p><iframe title="エースコンバットシリーズ30周年 記念ムービー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmXUy2MCUA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Since the release of the first title in 1995, thanks to your unwavering support, the ACE COMBAT series has reached a remarkable milestone—its 30th anniversary in 2025. First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all our fans and everyone involved who has supported the series throughout the years. Thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart. This moment is our chance to return thirty years’ worth of appreciation to you.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe that sustaining a legacy over three decades means far more than simply the passage of time. I’ve always shared this message with everyone involved in the series: “To deliver emotionally resonant, high-quality experiences that exceed expectations, to spark excitement for what comes next—and then to meet that anticipation with even greater ambition. By continuing this cycle, we build a bond of trust with our players, and that bond is the truest expression of our gratitude.”</em></p>
<p><em>Over the past thirty years, times have changed. Values have shifted, technologies have evolved. Our company and our team have continually transformed to navigate these tides. In a word, we’ve embraced change. There were times we may not have fully met your expectations. But I also believe there were moments when we exceeded them—when we soared higher than anyone imagined.</em></p>

<p><em>Namco’s founder, Masaya Nakamura, once said, “Only those who can adapt to change will survive.”</em><br>
<em>I joined Namco in 1994. Back then, I understood those words intellectually—but not yet from experience. Now, I truly do. After three incredible decades of adapting to change, we’ve built an enduring bond of trust with all of you. That connection is the very force that has sustained the ACE COMBAT series and propelled it into the future. I can now feel this truth in every fiber of my being. And I’m proud—proud that our ongoing commitment to delivering value and earning your trust has led us to this 30th anniversary. And now, we’re ready. Everything is in place. It’s time to take flight once again—toward even greater heights.”</em></p>
<p>Bandai Namco has partnered with <a href="https://www.type2.co.jp/products/ac/">Type 2 to release an Ace Combat Pro gaming controller</a>, primarily made for PC but it is also compatible with the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.&nbsp; The controller has Hall effect analog sticks to avoid drift issues. There are also four buttons on the back that can be assigned with customised inputs too.</p>

<p>The 30th anniversary poster for Ace Combat also teases the new entry to series with a conspicuous gap that can be see on the bottom right where there is space for a badge.</p>

<p>If you want to attend the 30th anniversary concert you will have to make your way to Saitama Kaikan in Saitama, Japan. It will be taking place on January 31st, 2026. This will not just be a concert to play some of the iconic tracks from the Ace Combat series, as the development team will be in attendance for a Q&amp;A session.</p>

<p>Iizuka once again shuts it down</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Sonic Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfbacd740607e/sonic-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're still grasping onto the idea of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_dx_directors_cut">Sonic Adventure</a> remaster in this here year 2025, then it might be time to put such hopes to rest, because it sounds like Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka simply isn't interested in the idea.</p>
<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVxhI6H5C_I">Shack News</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/aw-nah-this-aint-happenin-sega-on-potential-ps5-sonic-adventure-remasters">Push Square</a>) Iizuka said he acknowledges the requests from fans, but ultimately believes that the time required to bring Sonic Adventure up to modern standards would simply be better spent on creating a completely new title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>I do hear [the requests for a Sonic Adventure remaster] a lot. I really am appreciative for everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to kind of bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title.</em></p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0rgntsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
<p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>825k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
<p><em>"Part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that’s why there’s currently no plans.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it's important to note that Iizuka has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/sega-co-takashi-iizuka-expresses-interest-in-a-new-sonic-adventure-game">previously expressed interest in returning to the 'Sonic Adventure' sub-series</a>, but it seems far more likely that we'd see a hypothetical Sonic Adventure 3 than a remaster or remake of the previous two entries.</p>
<p>And y'know what, we're totally okay with that. As much as we love the Adventure games, they definitely represent Sonic Team's first proper foray into the realm of 3D Sonic, and uhh... yeah, you can tell. We'd probably rather Sonic Team take what it learned with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> and make a new, even better experience for fans.</p>
<p>We wouldn't say no to a Switch port, though. Just a port, y'know? Surely that's feasible, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has addressed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition's rocky launch, extending its refund policy for the game, offering a 50% upgrade path discount, and promising a string of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition</a> is a re-release of Relic Entertainment’s 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there’s no word on a PS5 version). While it appears to be going down okay on Game Pass, on Steam, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / £34.99, it has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-has-a-mostly-negative-steam-user-review-rating-with-players-labeling-it-a-shameless-blatant-cash-grab">Most of the complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition</a>, with other issues including usability problems and somewhat baffling visual changes. A lot of the negative reviews are from fans who say Sega should have given this Master Crafted Edition to owners of the original game for free or with a discount, which leads us nicely onto Sega’s latest update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3169520/view/523095184762732964" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>, Sega said “we’ve heard your concerns around pricing,” and outlined the steps it was taking. To start, it has extended its refund window for Master Crafted Edition to July 10. This means that if you bought the game you can get a full refund, regardless of playtime, as long as you request it before 6pm BST / 10pm PST on July 10, 2025 (when the Steam Summer Sale ends). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there is, as so many fans had asked for, now a 50% upgrade discount. If you own Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Anniversary Edition, you’re eligible for a 50% discount when buying the Master Crafted Edition until 6pm BST / 10pm PST July 10 2025 when the discount offer ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, that means if you already bought the Master Crafted Edition and qualify for the discount, you’ll need to request a refund manually via Steam Support (before July 10) then re-buy the game at the discounted price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know this situation has been frustrating for some of you, and we’re sorry for the confusion it’s caused,” Sega added. “We hope this approach offers a workable solution while we continue improving the game itself.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Sega released the patch roadmap for Master Crafted Edition. It includes a number of improvements all due out in the coming weeks. Highlights include user interface enhancements, fixes for the game running on Steam Deck, and networking improvements. The details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll continue listening, improving, and communicating as these changes go live,” Sega concluded. “Thanks for sticking with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 video games have been on a great run lately, with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> leading the charge of well-received, successful titles.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/29/edward-kenways-voice-actor-hints-at-a-black-flag-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edward-kenway%E2%80%99s-voice-actor-hints-at-a-black-flag-remake.1231383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Matt Ryan, the voice actor for Edward Kenway in Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, was recently filmed while signing merch at a convention. While he is busy signing his name, he looks up at the camera and asks, “Have you beat the game?” to which the person behind the camera replies, “I have, a while ago.”</p>
<p>“You may have to beat again,” says Matt, and then looks up with a very cheeky grin on his face.</p>


<p>Ubisoft confirmed remakes of Assassin’s Creed games were being considered but so far none have arrived. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is widely regarded as one of the best Assassin’s Creed games and rumours of a remake have been floating around in the ether for a good few years.</p>
<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-more-than-visual-upgrade-new-systems-mentioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP1st</a> recently reported that the remake would be running on the Anvil engine and “will feature new systems, with combat and ecosystems around wildlife specifically mentioned.” It has been suggested the remake would be out sometime this year, possibly in time for the big Christmas market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-hinted/">Insider Gaming</a> spotted that artists at Pure Arts, a company that makes statues based on video game characters, seemed to announce the game before anyone else. “Assassin’s Creed fans out there, you should be aware that there is something going on with Edward [Keyway]”, said one host who was then interrupted by the other host who seems to panic and says“Wait has that been announced?”</p>

<p>“I think so, I’m pretty sure I saw rumours about it. No, I definitely saw at article about it”, he continued, “So there’s going to be something going on with Edward, and our PVC 1/8th scale statue will reflect that accordingly”.</p>
<p>We gave the original release<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/10/30/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review/"> 9/10 back in 2013</a></p>
<p>“Black Flag is more than just a return to form for Assassin’s Creed, it is an overall improvement and probably the best game in the series yet,” said Gareth. “It has taken the gameplay of the previous games, refined it, and combined it with a huge open world that is packed with enough content to literally last for days. If you have ever wanted a proper pirate game, this is as good as it gets.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> has shelved development on an RPG but is releasing it as a demo, allowing players to enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Adam "adamgryu" Robinson-Yu started Untitled Paper RPG back in 2016, saying, "I was nostalgic for the old style of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see? I started cooking something up in Unity and… it looked cool! I thought, maybe I really could make this game."</p>
<p>Now, almost 10 years later, Robinson-Yu said they felt "overwhelmed", adding "the scope felt too big, I didn't have a story", doubts crept in about the turn-based combat, and "in general, started to lose the joy that I felt working on it".</p>

<p>"After releasing A Short Hike and working on the subsequent updates and ports… I didn't really want to go back to this game?" Robinson-Yu admitted. "The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but I've been working on other things and don't see myself making time for this RPG in near future."</p>
<p>Consequently, if you pop on over to the <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game#download">official website</a>, you can download a demo with one to two hours of content for both PC and Mac.</p>
<p>"Some people still ask about this game! I figured maybe sharing the demo is better than nothing," Robinson-Yu added, explaining why it's been released as a demo. "There is 1-2 hours of gameplay in the current build, after all. There's some stuff in there that I'm proud of, even if there's also some stuff that I find embarrassing! Hope you enjoy taking a peek behind the curtain at a game partway through an aimless development."</p>
<p>"Just finished a few minutes ago," said one player in the comments. "This was a wonderful demo. I had a gut feeling you wouldn't go back to this, but I never expected you'd actually drop a demo of what you have put together. It already has so much of the personality, humour, attention to detail and innate Nintendo-esque playfulness that defined your work on A Short Hike - and this was first!</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking the big leap of putting this out there!"</p>
<p>As for what else Robinson-Yu has planned? That includes an action aventure game, a "micro-RPG with a claymation asethetic", and an online platforming roguelike.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-short-hike-dev-halts-work-on-unfinished-rpg-saying-i-might-never-finish-this-so-im-releasing-the-demo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Void Interactive has confirmed the console port of its violent shooter, Ready or Not, has been changed "as absolutely required by our first party partners", including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence". And in some instances, these changes may be applied to the PC version, too.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1144200/announcements/detail/526472884483260568">update</a> posted to Steam, the team said that after some changes, the game secured a PEGI 18 / USK 18 / ESRB M-rating, and was "fortunate enough [...] to pass certification for the launch on our first submission". Void was now "relieved" to be finished with the console launch certification process and says any changes made "remain faithful to the original tonality of the game".</p>

<p>"Maintaining multiple versions of the game with different assets and system mechanics increases the likelihood of bugs to occur in future updates, and subsequent challenges keeping the game updated across multiple versions," the team explained, justifying why it's had to tweak the PC version, too. "Think lighting or optimisation issues, for example (or any number of unexpected bugs from maintaining different versions).</p>
<p>"If the in-game assets were not the same, it would make crossplay unusable; the game content must be equal or basically equal for multiplayer to work. Different versions of assets affects multiplayer replication, which is the ability for the server to understand what’s happening in-game and host players in the same lobby/server."</p>
<p>Player-induced dismemberment "still has a large presence" in the game, "but is a little more limited as to when it occurs", and you can't, for example, keep dismembering an enemy once it's dead. Tangentially, character art "involving torture were turned down slightly to be less over-the-top". The team has also had to "cover up" some characters "a bit more".</p>
<p>"Although we already make a substantial effort to present mistreatment against children in the game in a responsible way, we made slight thematic expansions of this philosophy in order to better meet certification standards," the team explained when it came to violence against children. "For example, the child on Twisted Nerve has had an animation change to be unconscious/sleeping, instead of the previously convulsive animation from before that had a violent appearance.</p>
<p>"The changes with the console version are small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything, but we want to be transparent. It's largely just evidence and nudity that's altered, and the texture changes don't affect the PC version." In-game evidence of "illicit child stuff" has also been censored, but only in the console version.</p>
<p>Some fans have responded to the changes by review-bombing the game on Steam, citing "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052063771/recommended/1144200">cowardly</a>" "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199497107322/recommended/1144200/">censorship</a>".</p>
<p>Ready or Not will release for consoles on 15th July, 2025.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Players have hit out at The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios after AI prompts were discovered in both subtitles and flavour text in the game, intimating routine use of large language models (LLMs) without disclosure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">January 2024</a>, Valve has required games that use pre- or live-generated AI to divulge this as part of the Steam Distribution Agreement. This includes art, code, sound, and more that have been created with the help of AI tools. At the time of writing, The Alters has made no such disclosure.</p>

<p>In one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/">example</a>, an in-game screen that's presumably there to look all sci-fi-y and scientific begins with: "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data".</p>
<p>Another commenter who'd played through with subtitles on Brazilian Portuguese <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leaitepuc.bsky.social/post/3lsojo3f75c2c">noted</a> "several times the subtitles go crazy", which was later backed up with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/windblow.org/post/3lsomub3i3k2g">screenshot</a> that evidenced it. The subtitle read: "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is: Every conversation two people can have, right? So we-"</p>

<p>"The game is using AI-generated content without a proper Steam Page disclaimer!" said another player on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1601570/discussions/0/604160267118483770/">Steam</a>. "This is absolutely unacceptable. 11 bit studios has been caught using AI in The Alters without ANY disclaimer on the Steam page.</p>

<p>"Look, I love The Alters. It's brilliantly written, and I was planning on leaving it a glowing Steam review once I was done. But this is a disgrace. Seriously, leaving parts of an AI prompt in the lockit?! Talk about spitting in the face of your international audience!</p>
<p>"According to the OP, some parts of the PT-BR translation are also riddled with errors and inaccuracies, which is appalling considering how the whole game revolves around an intricate narrative."</p>
<p>Danilov posited that the mistake was either the work of a "careless translator taking shortcuts", or it was "done by someone on the dev/publisher side who couldn't be arsed sending last-minute missing lines for translation and decided to throw them in a random LLM without oversight".</p>
<p>Handong Ryu, who handled the Korean translation for the game, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7344697496150941696?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7344697496150941696%2C7344781387704483840%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287344781387704483840%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7344697496150941696%29">replied</a>: "I was responsible for translating the vast majority of the Korean version of The Alters. Unfortunately, the same issue exists in the Korean version as well, which makes it more likely that the second scenario you mentioned is closer to the truth. While no AI prompt has been exposed, I can confirm that the same section of the Korean localisation shows clear signs of having been run through an LLM without proper editing.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, 11 Bit has not publicly addressed the allegations or responded to player comments. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">Jurassic Park Evolution 3 removed generative AI for scientists' portraits</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3, "following some initial feedback".</p>
<p>"There's something startlingly unique about what 11 Bit Studios does in its games, and the moral quandaries it puts us in, and this clone story in The Alters is no exception," Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-alters-review">Eurogamer's The Alters review</a>, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>
