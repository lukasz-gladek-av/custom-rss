			<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Korean developer Pearl Abyss finally nailed down a release window for Crimson Desert. The game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019, and back then, it was still billed as an MMO that was not too dissimilar from the studio's premiere game, Black Desert. Not long afterward, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a genre change from MMO to single-player open-world action/adventure, albeit still with optional multiplayer support. Back then, the game was still tentatively headed toward a Winter 2021 launch, but in July 2021, Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the project had been indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert Time of Day Timelapse" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrtH_Kwto94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Crimson Desert only <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> at Gamescom 2023 with a gameplay trailer. Multiplayer appears to have been silently cut, but other than that, communication has been constant, and there have even been limited hands-on opportunities at various conventions. At the recent Game Developers Conference 2025 in San Francisco, Pearl Abyss put the spotlight on the game's BlackSpace Engine. According to the team, the proprietary technology can render vast, sprawling, and seamless open worlds with great detail. In the game, Kliff and his fellow Greymanes will traverse a variety of landscapes, including lush forests, medieval-inspired cities, snow-capped mountains, and vast deserts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert GPU based Cloth and Hair Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HcY56F6o1V0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The simulations running under the hood of the BlackSpace Engine augment the realism of the environments: trees, grass, cloth, and hair are all naturally affected by wind movement. The environments featured in Crimson Desert also support real-time physics and destructibility, not to mention volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather. Optionally, ray tracing can further enhance visual realism. The engine also supports highly realistic water effects thanks to the usage of FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation, creating realistic waves, currents, and ripples.</p>

<p>Lastly, the BlackSpace engine also improves combat encounters thanks to the detailed hit reactions and physics-based interactions.&nbsp;Object destruction can vary depending on the force applied, and enemies can dynamically collide with the environment, adding depth to combat. Pearl Abyss has shared several brief videos of the technology. You can find them embedded throughout this article.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, Crimson Desert promises a great variety of traditional content (quests, puzzles, dungeons), 'life' content (cooking, hunting, mining, gathering, fishing, crafting, horse taming), and a fairly complex combat system that combines parrying, blocking, dodging, jumping, and even some wrestling moves. The players will create their own unique combos.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert is slated to launch this Fall on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Minecraft is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">most successful video games ever</a>, but no one should expect Mojang to release a "Minecraft 2" anytime soon, or ever. Ingela Garneij, executive producer on Minecraft Vanilla, was asked recently if the company could ever come out with a straight-up sequel.</p><p>Garneij responded to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: "Do you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2."</p><p>This response is no surprise at all, as Mojang and Microsoft have said for years that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/" data-ref-id="1100-6429533">there will not be a Minecraft 2</a>, at least not soon.

"We've existed for 15 years. We want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla's game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that," Garneij said.</p><p>Garneij did admit, however, that Minecraft's aging technology base "slows us down" when it comes to development. "So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges]," they said.</p><p>As part of the Minecraft Live event this past weekend, Mojang announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-is-a-massive-step-forward-for-the-14-year-old-game/1100-6530266/" data-ref-id="1100-6530266">Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update</a> that makes significant changes to the popular game with regards to its visuals.</p><p>In other news, A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters on April 4, starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa.

		<p>Racoon Logic are, quite understandably, out for revenge. Founded by former members of the Journey to the Savage Planet team after Google decided that, nah, games just weren’t their thing and streaming is stupid, they resorted to exact their vengeance by making Revenge of the Savage Planet even bigger, better and indulging in even more excess. Sucks to be us, I guess?</p>
<p><iframe title="Revenge of the Savage Planet Co-op Preview –&nbsp;Goo for two?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nv_vBAA7d2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Call me a 90s gamer all you want, but there’s something special about FMV in games. Revenge of the Savage Planet takes it to RoboCop levels of weirdness, from adverts for what’s basically Huel in binliners, to the introductory video by a VP of the space megacorp Alta Interglobal having just the right amount of bizarre camera framing, zooms and crazy eyes. I love how over the top they go, and look forward to seeing all the barmy creations sprinkled through the full game.</p>


<p>And that strangeness, that sense of silly fun is fed through into the rest of the game as well. Crash landing on another alien world, and stepping out for the first time, your character looks around for you in first person… until they’re shocked into the camera shooting out the back of their head to reveal the third person camera for this sequel. Journey was a first-person game, and while Racoon Logic considered the switch to third-person, it was too close to release. So the sequel gives them the chance to set that right.</p>


<p>One of the first things you’ll notice is just how excessive all of the animations are, almost like they’ve been lifted straight out of some early hand-drawn animated movies. There’s a wonderful cartoonish tone to simply running around the world, kicking your co-op buddy up the butt, knee sliding down slopes, and run-wading through water. It brings a huge amount of expressiveness to the game that goes together with the vibrant and equally imaginative alien worlds you can explore – yup, worlds plural this time, which obviously doesn’t quite work with the title’s singular planet, but let’s not complain too much about that.</p>
<p>Accompanied by your rather sardonic AI EKO, it doesn’t take long before you’ve unlocked a double jump, a blaster, dipped a hand into the orange goop bubbles that give you extra stamina and health, encountered your first goo type, and reach the abandoned space habs of Nu Florida. These were sent to the planet ahead of you, giving you a home base to return to and customise as you adventure through the solar system. Of course, you’ll pop back to visit the 3D printer and spit out some new gear and upgrades, needed to explore new parts of the world and strip back some early limitations.</p>

<p>The opening world of Revenge of the Savage Planet is gorgeous, a green and verdant planet that has lovely blankets of foliage to scamper through. You’ll be using your visor constantly as you reach each area, scanning all of the different flora and fauna that you find. And that fauna is heckin’ strange, including what amounts to just a giant racoon head with tiny legs, and which splat into puddles of green blood and some bulbous eyes when you shoot them. Or there’s the oversized dung beetle like creatures that try to flip their bodies over on you, or diminutive little ball of angry teeth that just want to chase after and explode at your feet. Some creatures will need tricks to defeat –&nbsp;the beetles have weak spots you can shoot to stun them, while green gelatinous cubes can be blasted with water…. or lava – but there’s also a goal to capture animals like it’s Metal Gear Solid V and beam them back to a sanctuary at your home base.</p>
<p>Jumping ahead to a later save file, we got to sample some of the extra abilities and new twists for this game. There’s still a grappling hook, there’s also now a hang-glider and some underwater gear to help you explore, going really nicely with the shift to third person, but the big new hook are the multiple coloured goos that you can squirt out around the world. The first you stumble across – well, slip ‘n’ slide across – is the green slippery goo, which feels like as much of a hindrance as a help, to be honest. You can use it to spray creatures and enemies to make them lose their footing… but then you’ll slip around on it too. It’s a good thing that you’ve got a water hose for some PowerWash Simulator action.</p>
<p>Or do the opposite. You’ll also get a Lava tank to fire out grenades of flaming magma, which is great fun when you manage to nail an arcing shot at a flying enemy, but is even more fun when you discover that green goo is extremely flammable. Just, uh, try not to blast it when you or your buddy is stood in it? Rounding out the options we saw was the Ferro Goo, an electrically conductive and super sticky paint.</p>

<p>All of this is playable in co-op, whether with online multiplayer or local split screen. I’ve already mentioned giving your co-op buddy a hefty boot, an immediate reaction to see if friendly fire is turned on like it’s Halo or something. It’s not, but the goo can have an explosive side effect that does affect your partner (and it’s invariably amusing). There’s a few kinks still to workout with the build we played, things like objective markers only playing on one side of the split screen, and cutscenes also being shrunk to half screen, but hopefully Racoon Logic is working through those ahead of launch in May. Having this possibility is honestly fantastic to see, and no doubt a real technical challenge given the open worlds.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet takes that delightfully off-beast tone of Journey to the Savage Planet and ramps everything up a few notches. The shift to third person exudes a toon-like silliness through the character animations, the FMV adverts are a bizarre delight, and blasting creatures as you rampage through the world messing with all kinds of goop promises to add a lot to the Metroidvania-like exploration.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/winkeltje-the-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-announced-for-2025.1143075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cozy shop sim&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup by the name of&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, and developer and publisher Sassybot's new game is coming to PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Sassybot says that while&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>may bear a new name, it will have the "same charm of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-10-update-finally-arrives" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>", as well as boasting "more depth and customisation options than ever before".</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje</em>, you'll be running your own cozy little shop, and you'll grow it from humble beginnings into the lifeblood of a bustling fantasy town with plenty of repeat customers to get to know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=Sh5og0-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=yICd1HQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>asks you to manage your very own bustling fantasy shop (or perhaps that should be "shoppe").</figcaption></figure><p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>is to "stay ahead in a shifting economy" by selling everything your customers might need, "from fresh goods to enchanted armor". If you can imagine a less anime-styled&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</em></a>, then you're probably not a million miles away.</p>

<p>Sassybot is also promising plenty of "eccentric" characters to meet in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, each of whom will have their own "secrets" to uncover. You'll get to know them across shifting seasons, which will bring new challenges and new opportunities for your shop.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create many of the items you're looking to sell, from forging armor yourself through to growing and sourcing your own fresh produce.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a shop sim, you'll also need to pay attention to your balance sheets; you'll need to hire employees, make sure you're paying them fairly, and "make tough business decisions" in order to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of your store.</p>




<p><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year. Sadly, we don't have a more specific release date for the game than that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526560/Faire_Trade?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

He conjured up an impressive Rube Goldberg track that sees the mustached plumber winning a race full of pencils, strings, an ironing board, and even a moving green shell.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybSLWd0MH4">On YouTube</a>, Herscher shared his impressive Mario Kart creation on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephsMachines">Joseph's Machines channel</a>. The race is viewed twice in the video--seen below--from different camera perspectives. Donkey Kong faces a pretty terrible fate in the race, and how Mario overtakes Baby Luigi at the end is so cool.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybSLWd0MH4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cybSLWd0MH4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">The Mario Kart Lego kits</a> came out a couple of months ago, with six different options available.

Battlefield's lead producer, David Sirland, has now reacted to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-dev-reacts-to-games-many-leaks-i-am-not-ok-with-leaks/1100-6530040/" data-ref-id="1100-6530040">many leaks</a> that have come out of the Battlefield Labs test, saying he doesn't plan to discuss specifics of the private test. He added that while fan feedback is appreciated and helpful to DICE, this feedback isn't the sole driver of changes planned for the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/with_replies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Sirland reminded fans that Battlefield Labs "exists for a reason," and that reason is to allow the developers at DICE to refine the experience ahead of launch. Any footage that has leaked out of the tests is not necessarily representative of the game that fans will one day play.</p><p>"This BF may look to play one way, but I assure you it also has many layers you need to play to perceive," Sirland said. "A key reason (outside of making a BF everyone wants to play) to use something like Labs. Allowing us as devs to find the best possible outcome of our designs--together."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1828434486" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

The team is now working on a single-player action-adventure game called Crimson Desert, which uses the same custom Black Desert game engine specifically designed for the first game.

high fantasy continent called Pywel. My tour through the open world via a dev kit included examples of cloth and hair reacting to changing wind direction, shadows moving in conjunction to multiple light sources of various intensities, and various degrees of severity when it came to different weather conditions, all of which influenced NPCs and certain elements (like water and wind) to behave in a believable way.</span></p><p dir="ltr">You'll laugh, but the aspect of the walkthrough that impressed me the most was watching a horse get drenched in water. I haven't seen anything like either before in any video game. As I watched protagonist Kliff ride through a stream while on horseback, Pearl Abyss showcased how only the parts of the horse that actually touched the water remained wet after leaving the stream. I've seen plenty of video game characters enter water and leave with their clothes still drenched, but I've never seen a game reflect whether only a horse's hooves got wet, or only the legs--I even saw the horse only get partially submerged, and the game accurately reflected on the horse how drenched they got instead of reverting to a fully-drenched state.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511"></a><figcaption>This is just a remarkably pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Does any of this have anything to do with how fun Crimson Desert will be? Presumably not, and since I didn't get a chance to play the game, I can't speak to what the gameplay feels like--I saw a smidge of combat and exploration in action, though, and both looked pretty cool). But the Black Desert engine is a lot more detailed than Black Desert Online led me to believe, and it feels like Pearl Abyss is really pushing it through its paces for this game to create as immersive an experience as the team can. For those who like to just <em>exist </em>in the world of an RPG and appreciate how even the smallest of details are considered, Crimson Desert might be the game to watch this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Crimson Desert is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in late 2025. The game sees you play as Kliff, a mercenary who finds himself repeatedly dragged into conflicts that threaten to plunge the world of Pywel and its people into chaos.</p>

But the metadata for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>’s Steam page was just updated, and at this point that’s enough to set the fanbase ablaze with uncontrollable fervour. </p><p><em>Silksong</em> was originally announced in 2019, two years after the release of the original—and wildly popular—metroidvania. Developers Team Cherry never gave a release date, but three years later and with no further updates since the end of 2019, people were getting very worried. In June 2022, Team Cherry said the game would be released within the following 12 months, but 11 months later announced it would be delayed. That was the last official information ever given, but for two years later <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081">the team’s PR person replying to someone on X to say the game was still being developed</a></span>.</p><p>The latest Steam update is extraordinarily minor. The game is now opted in for GeForce Now support, and has updated its copyright data from 2019 to 2025. Other than some fiddling with hidden assets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/history/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that’s genuinely it</a></span>. For context, in February this year the store page opted into Steam’s Family Sharing system, having removed it in September 2024. Having added it in August... These teeny tweaks are a normal occurrence, the page being amended for other minor details every few months. But <em>surely this time it means something more?!</em></p><p> True believer and update chronicler Primacon seems hopeful it’s a sign. “WE MIGHT WIN THIS YEAR BABY LETS GO,” their post on X reads, noting that this is the first time the copyright date has been updated since the 2019 announcement. However, Primacon’s&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@Primacon/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Primacon/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a></span> is a graveyard of similar moments of desperate hope for <em>Silksong</em>’s eventual release, none ever coming to pass.</p><p>Many others are poring over the microscopic changes like mystical runes.</p><p>Much of the gloriously optimistic rumor-mongering centers on the belief that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will be announced as part of Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct, due April 4. And that’d make a lot of sense, given it would be a perfect launch title for Nintendo’s new console! It’s just important to put this belief in the context of the same community being equally certain that the game was due to be featured in <em>every single </em>Nintendo Direct for the last six years, and indeed every Sony or Microsoft stream, and every Keighley-fest show, and every time the wind changes.</p><p>Gosh, it’d be great if it were true this time! But, it seems a bit more likely that someone at Team Cherry, bored out of their mind, thought they’d just check the Steam backend and noticed the copyright was out of date. Let’s hope it’s more though.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new God of War game is reportedly going to be released this year, and it's apparently a side-story involving Greece.</p><p>According to Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-god-of-war-side-story-project-set-in-greece-is-coming-this-year-its-claimed/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a>, the game is a brand-new title and not a remaster collection. It'll focus on Greek mythology rather than the Norse mythology found in God of War (2018) and Ragnarok. It's unclear what "side-story" means, but it's possible that it could be referring to a smaller kind of game that's too big to be standalone DLC. Examples include Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. God of War previously got several Greek-focused prequels, including two PSP games and God of War: Ascension on PS3.</p><p>The first three God of War games focused on Greek mythology.

However, Sony did announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-new-free-update-this-month-to-celebrate-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/1100-6530140/" data-ref-id="1100-6530140">Dark Odyssey cosmetic DLC</a> for the 20th anniversary.</p><p>A God of War TV show adaptation is also in the works, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">two seasons already ordered for Amazon TV</a>.

But could the game make its way to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>? We don't know, but Pocketpair's communications director, John Buckley, said in an interview that technical reasons are to blame for Palworld's absence on Switch so far.</p><p>"If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is expected to have better specs, but Buckley said Pocketpair has not "seen those specs yet" for the upcoming console.</p><p>"Like everyone else, we're waiting," he said. "If [the Switch 2 is] beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering," he said. "We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p><p>It's also an open question as to whether or not Nintendo would permit Pocketpair to release Palworld on Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-launches-new-game-on-switch-in-middle-of-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6528719/#:~:text=Palworld%20developer%20Pocketpair%20has%20launched,tower%20defense%2C%20and%20roguelike%20elements." data-ref-id="1100-6528719">Pocketpair's Overdungeon launched on Switch earlier this year</a> amid the lawsuit against Nintendo and The Pokemon Company.</p><p>Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing Pocketpair for patent infringement related to mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD).</a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/huge-palworld-update-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-new-pal-storage/1100-6530211/" data-ref-id="1100-6530211">Palworld just got a huge new update that added, among other things, cross-play and a photo mode</a>.</p>

			<p>Though not at stock settings, even with its dated hardware, the Nintendo Switch is more than capable of pushing higher than 60 FPS averages, even in some demanding games.</p>
<p>A new video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> on YouTube showcases how an overclocked system modded with 8GB RAM is capable of running several games at high framerates. Demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are a little unstable but still manage to run at an average close to 100 FPS, but undemanding games and remasters like Sonic Superstars, Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have no trouble hitting and keeping the 120 FPS mark.</p>
<p><iframe title="120Hz Gaming on Nintendo Switch - FPS Locker 2.2.0 Beta Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTjwd0Hsxo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an overclocked Nintendo Switch is still much weaker than its successor, the fact that it is capable of pushing high framerates suggests how the Nintendo Switch 2 may not have trouble doing the same, at least for backward-compatible titles. According to rumors, the upcoming console will feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-vrr-screen/">120 Hz display with VRR support</a>, which would considerably improve handheld play not only for backward-compatible titles but even for next-generation titles, as a 120 Hz display with VRR support would open the door to 40 FPS support, which improves games considerably, despite the small difference over 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer if a high-framerate future is in the cards for Nintendo, as the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully unveiled in a little over a week, on April 2nd, in a new Direct focused on the system. The event is also reportedly confirming the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">release date.</a></p>
