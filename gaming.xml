			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-skipping-pc-lose-40-sales/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> will have a massive impact on the video game industry when it launches, so it's no surprise that its delay into next year is also having a huge impact on the industry in 2025.</p>
<p>Analytics firm Ampere Analysis has lowered its revenue and sales forecast for the video game console market, specifically for PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/i/163618942/gta-delay-could-mean-fewer-xbox-and-playstation-console-sales-this-year-ampere-analysis">The Game Business</a> reports. Ampere's Piers Harding-Rolls expects PlayStation and Xbox to sell <strong>700,000</strong> fewer consoles than they would have if GTA VI were still being released this year.</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls and Ampere also estimate that 21 million fewer game sales will be made, and that between hardware and software revenue, the console market is missing out on approximately <strong>$2.7 billion&nbsp;</strong>in revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, the knock-on effect of all this is that expectations for 2026 are that much higher, but we're not yet halfway through 2025, and the year already looks drastically different from the one the video game industry thought it would have in January 2025.</p>
<p>Without GTA VI in the holiday lineup, the one platform that will benefit, Harding-Rolls suggests, will be Nintendo. Harding-Rolls and Ampere Analysis also aren't alone in this suggestion, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">DFC Intelligence reports</a> that in its estimates, it sees Nintendo benefiting from Grand Theft Auto VI's delay, while PlayStation and Xbox have a much more muted year.</p>
<p>Overall, Ampere now estimates that the industry will only grow by 0.9%, with a bigger 2.2% jump coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Shortly after the news of Grand Theft Auto VI being delayed was announced, it was reported that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">game had no chance of actually releasing in 2025</a>. Unfortunate as that might be for fans hoping to play it this year, the delay doesn't seem to have really <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">impacted excitement</a>, as eager fans continue to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">salivate</a> over the small bits of the game we have seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667211/persona-5-the-phantom-x-pc-mobile-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not the next mainline entry in the series, but Atlus did announced a new <em>Persona</em> game today. It’s called <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, and it’s a spinoff that’s launching on both mobile and PC on June 26th.</p><p>As the name implies, <em>The Phantom X</em> is set in the same universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3">2017’s <em>Persona 5</em></a>, and will feature a new main character leading a new band of Phantom Thieves. This story takes place in “a mysterious Tokyo where desires have been lost.” The structure of <em>The Phantom X</em> sounds a lot like traditional <em>Persona</em>, as players will experience normal high school life during the day, before heading off to explore dungeons at night. There’s also turn-based combat and a “synergy system” where players can form close ties with NPCs in the game.</p><p>There are also multiplayer elements, including guilds which allow “players to interact with one another in-game.” From the sounds of it, <em>The Phantom X</em> is an attempt to blend the single-player RPGs the franchise is known for with live-service mobile games designed to keep players coming back. It’s hard to say right now how well those two sides will gel together; it’s also not clear at the moment if the game will be free-to-play. Hopefully it still has curry.</p><p>Given it’s been nearly a decade since <em>Persona 5</em> launched, Atlus releasing another spinoff will likely be a disappointment to some fans expecting any sign of life from <em>Persona 6</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">at least <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> turned out well</a>). Then again, <em>The Phantom X</em> at least looks the part, and might be a good way to fill in the time before the next major release.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Joining the word 'bum' in my demo preview was some thoughts on how the concept initially reminded me of the first iteration of tabletop dungeon crawler Warhammer Quest, which used a randomised tile deck to keep you guessing about the layout of your subterranean environs. Things work a little differently here: you'll be trying to reach a goal by constructing your dungeon from a deck you can add more cards to after each run. The runs involve autobattling, although you can finesse it somewhat with positioning.</p>
<p>I actually think the automatic combat is the sensible choice here, though, because you haven't got a map, and it keeps your brainspace free for navigation. As your layout gets more complex, you end up memorising routes and building in such a way as to allow you to scoop up more rewards. Maybe create a little enclave of healing rooms so you can batter enemies for longer? Maybe something more devious. Don't tell me. That'll ruin your chittering schemes, ratman. I wasn't actually sure if I'd missed the map, initially, so I mentioned it the article, and designer Tony Gowland replied. Who's quoting who now, Ant Workshop!</p>
<p>"There’s no map while you’re adventuring," wrote Tony. "This was deliberate so that keeping your dungeon memorable as you build it is another thing players have to factor in. It’s by far the most controversial design element and we’re really happy it landed for you".</p>
<p>It most definitely did. Into the Restless Ruins is currently £12/€13/$13 on Steam. Bum bum, bum bum. Bum, bum. Bum.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, it’s not <em>Persona 6</em>, but rather <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, a spin-off that is finally making its way out of China and into other territories.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196572" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unlike the rest of the <em>Persona 5 </em>games, <em>The Phantom X </em>doesn’t follow Joker, Ryuji, and the rest of the original game’s cast. Instead, it follows a different group of Phantom Thieves led by a high school student code-named Wonder. The team attends a different high school and is accompanied by a different mascot character, the tonfa-wielding owl named Lufel. The other major difference between <em>The Phantom X </em>and most <em>Persona </em>games is that it has microtransactions and gacha mechanics. Yes, to take part in the game’s social sim and dungeon crawling, you’ll have to either wait for a set amount of time to pass or use currency to replenish your energy. Otherwise, the game is free-to-play. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p><p><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X </em>will launch on PC and mobile devices on June 26. When Atlus first teased the announcement, some people thought it was referencing <em>Persona 6</em>. However, the RPGs typically shed their previous color scheme and aesthetics with each mainline entry, so most fans knew the black-and-red graphic indicated that whatever this game was, it was still part of the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries. This, coupled with the owl emoji used on the social posts, clearly hinted at a <em>Phantom X</em> announcement, but the game<em> </em>has been sequestered in China for so long that some fans aren’t even aware of it. <em>The Phantom X </em>was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-new-announced-phantom-of-night-p5-p5x-mobile-1850235928">originally announced in 2023</a></span> and has been in an open beta phase in the territory since last year.</p><p>With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836"><em>Persona 6 </em>rumors floating around</a></span>, it’s entirely possible that <em>The Phantom X </em>could be the final game in the <em>Persona 5 </em>subseries.

Everyone knows what the Switch can do, and for the most part the Switch 2 is just a bigger, better version of that existing product. Most fans have probably already made up their minds one way or the other. </p><p>Delaying Switch 2 reviews seems of a piece with Nintendo’s evolving direct-to-consumer approach, beginning years ago with Nintendo Directs and culminating recently in a dedicated standalone news app for the new hardware.

Insight into any major shortcomings or bugs that need to be ironed out ahead of launch could be the difference between someone paying hundreds of dollars over the $450 price tag to a scalper on eBay, or just waiting until more inventory is available closer to the 2025 holiday season. </p><p>One PR rep at a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-hogwarts-legacy-civ-7-1851780505">third-party developer with a launch game</a></span> for the Switch 2 told <em>The Game Business </em>that the “lack of independent critical validation” now makes them wonder if they should have waited to release their game until a few weeks after the dust had settled around the new hardware. We’ll know how it all shakes out in just a few weeks when Nintendo’s next console generation kicks off in June. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After launching in South Korea, China, and Taiwan back in April 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x/" data-ref-id="5000-584986">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> finally has a worldwide release date. The Persona 5 spin-off hits PC and mobile devices on June 26, 2025, and brings with it even more of the series' stylish turn-based combat and an entirely new cast of Phantom Thieves.</p><p>Developed as a collaboration between Atlus' P-Studio and Chinese developer Black Wing Games, Persona 5: The Phantom X is a mobile-focused title that sends players back to the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a>, albeit as a new character and under slightly different circumstances. In it, players control Wonder, a second-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy whose worldview is shifted upon meeting a mysterious owl-like creature named Lufel. After some good old-fashioned exposition, the duo eventually set off on quest to recruit a new cast of Phantom Thieves, their ultimate goal being to restore the concept of desire back to humanity and put a stop to the mysterious force hellbent on taking it away.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5btk2fzbRjQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5btk2fzbRjQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What ensues is a continuously-expanding, live-service adventure filled with much of the same turn-based combat, social simulation, and time management elements found in mainline Persona titles. Players will get the chance to explore new dungeons and areas of Mementos, take on part-time jobs and join after-school clubs, strengthen their Personas, raise Wonder's social stats, and form relationships all while experiencing an original story. Players can also expect fan-favorite Persona characters--like Joker, Ann, Ryuji, and the rest of the original Phantom Thieves--to make appearances in the game via special contracts. Lastly, the Phantom X also introduces new elements to the series, including the PvE-focused Velvet Trials, mini-games, and the ability to create and join Guilds.</p><p>Since its release in select regions last year, the title has earned a lot of praise for its story and new cast of characters, with players stating that both are shockingly on par with those found in the Persona 5. This could certainly have something to do with Persona veterans--like series producer Kazuhisa Wada, composer Ryota Kozuka, and artist Shigenori Soejima--being involved in the game's development.</p><p>However, it's important to note that the upcoming title has gacha elements, similar to games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves. Though you don't <em>have </em>to spend money in order to play through The Phantom X, players are often encouraged to, which can definitely be a barrier when it comes to fully enjoying the game.</p><p>Persona 5: The Phantom X will launch on mobile and PC worldwide on June 26. For a closer look at the upcoming title, we've included screenshots and a few pieces of the game's key art below.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4494724,1300-4494725,1300-4494726,1300-4494727,1300-4494728,1300-4494729,1300-4494730,1300-4494731,1300-4494732,1300-4494733" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"></figure>

The journey began six days ago, in Boston, and is currently in Augusta, Maine, venturing toward Stephen King country on what appears to be a collective desire to reach Canada. Directions are chosen by votes that take place every few seconds—whichever available direction receives the majority of the votes, that’s the way the Street View moves, made all the more adorable by the inclusion of a steering wheel at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Since I’ve been watching/voting for a couple of hours (since my chum Paul tipped me off to the game—thanks Paul!), a whopping five miles of progress has been made. This is partly because the entire endeavor is inherently slow, but also because of awful people (tee hee) who keep voting to take completely pointless detours. Should enough malevolent people (snicker) vote to take a right down some dirt track that loops back onto the main road, that’s what’ll happen, to the dismay of all the sensible people in the site’s chat.</p><figure id="" data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-recommend-id="image://880cca8e56a1f3943bbf1ed003a72238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving through Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chat is a more recent addition, and according to leading expert Paul, it’s made the whole thing a lot less soothing. It has, however, allowed for those who maliciously choose silly directions (giggle) to see the enraged reactions of the folk actually trying to get somewhere. Of course, given that it’s made up of contributions from 1,100 strangers via Discord, be warned there’s also a lot of garbage in there. (It is apparently <em>hilarious</em> to respond “gay” when anyone encourages voters to pick “straight” on.)</p><p>Consensus appears to be a desire to reach Canada, with the more confident denizens of the chat window already debating whether to head to Montreal specifically. By my estimation that dream is weeks away, if not longer given how many nefarious types seem to vote for loop-de-loop routes (guffaw). Much better to just focus on Bangor for now. Oh, and if you can rally enough people, you can vote to change the radio station, the “DJ” of which I’m pretty sure has been voiced by creator Neal Agarwal himself. Or you can even vote to honk the horn (something that won favor when the Street View had the car in the wrong lane of traffic, with cars coming straight toward us).</p><figure id="" data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Neal Agarwal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-recommend-id="image://6f3e5f261d015dcdaa335c9cc22fc021" data-format="jpg" data-width="1520" data-height="855" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Google Street View image of a car driving toward a spooky house in Augusta, Maine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Agarwal has an extraordinary gift for data manipulation.

                <p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its commitment to fixing the gameplay issues</a> that plagued <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a> since its launch. Today, the game's second DLC story, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-big-star-wars-outlaws-surprise-has-been-spoiled-by-a-leak/1100-6530948/" data-ref-id="1100-6530948">A Pirates Fortune</a>, is launching alongside a new Star Wars Outlaws patch that's adding a few more improvements.</p><p>Ubisoft shared the details about the new patch <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/6xjEjWMQplZquUcRmLrKco/swo-patch-update-16" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Star Wars Outlaws' official site</a>. Some of the most notable changes involve Kay's newfound ability to smoothly switch from her blaster to two-handed weapons. Kay has also gained the ability to free-fire while riding her speeder. New space contracts have also been added for all players that feature multiple challenge types for additional rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urp3XfddqZs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Urp3XfddqZs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the latest changes are essentially cleaning up problems, like audio lines playing out of order or certain props disappearing or floating in the air during cutscenes. A handful of other fixes were introduced to keep players from being unable to complete intel quests and to prevent Kay from getting trapped in a room on Toshara while respawning.</p><p>Today's patch also features new cosmetic items based on the Star Wars: Skeleton Crew TV series, including an outfit for Nix. Those items are available to all players and can be found on the Trailblazer in Kay's delivery crate.</p><p>The full patch notes are below.

Fans have fallen in love with Esquie, one of your companions in the game, and a lovable oaf. Soon, you might be able to bring Esquie into your home as Sandfall has revealed it is looking into creating official plushies of the character, as first reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/expedition-33-dev-to-turn-the-games-best-character-into-a-plushie"><em>Push Square</em></a>.</p><p>News of a potential Esquie plushie comes at the end of a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078">post on X</a> by the team warning fans that Esquie plushies do not currently exist and anyone advertising them is likely using AI to create mockups. The team urges fans not to purchase any kind of Expedition 33 plush from these sellers as “they could be scams” while waiting for something official.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We’ve noticed a number of suspicious websites popping up, claiming to sell Esquie plushies.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc.1190031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Video games industry analysis firm DFC Intelligence has published an updated report on the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, raising its previous sales forecast from 15 million units to 16 million units sold by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>This is based on the fact that Nintendo tends to have a conservative approach in its forecast of a new product (which is 15 million units). With the original Switch, Nintendo had originally estimated to sell 10 million units but ended up selling 15 million. DFC believes Switch 2 could sell as many as 20 million units if the manufacturing could meet the demand for the console, but this is unlikely to happen, hence the 16 million forecast.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay of Grand Theft Auto VI</a> to May 26, 2026, DFC thinks that the Nintendo Switch 2 launch is even more critical for the industry, going as far as claiming that it's arguably the most important console launch ever. GTA VI would have significantly propelled sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series consoles, but with that factor gone for 2025, DFC now forecasts a decline in console video game software sales in both North America and Europe. North America is expected to see a 2% decline in 2025, with Europe anticipated to see revenue remain flat from 2024.</p>
<p>In the Far East, though, Japan is estimated to see a 25% uptick in console software revenue this year. That's mainly thanks to the aggressive pricing of the Nintendo Switch 2 on its home turf, where users can grab a region-locked version for ¥49,980 (around $342), a much lower price than anywhere else in the world. After adding Japanese sales, DFC forecasts global video game console sales to grow by 3% in 2025.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Credit: DFC Intelligence</figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, DFC Intelligence estimates that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would make it the leading console platform by far. As previously discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our interview with firm founder, CEO, and principal David Cole</a>, DFC believes Nintendo is positioning the new console as a primary gaming system and could potentially become the lead partner for several third-party publishers.</p>
<p>As for the industry as a whole, DFC expects GTA VI to help kickstart a new growth phase for the videogame industry between 2026 and 2029, setting new hardware and software sales records.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Ubisoft Layoffs Probably Coming After Grim Year for Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-ubisoft-layoffs-probably-coming-after-grim-year-for-sales.1190028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its latest financial summary, which covers the 2024-25 fiscal year, and it's safe to say that things aren't exactly looking up for the studio right now.</p>

<p>In its presentation, Ubisoft reveals that both sales and profit are down compared to last year. The period in question technically also covers the launch of recent flagship game&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so although the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">sales performance was strong</a>, it wasn't enough to save the studio from a tough year.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft says it will refocus its efforts towards "more evergreen offering(s)" as part of a "product roadmap optimization", presumably meaning we can expect to see fewer one-off titles and more live-service-adjacent games from the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=suJOpzQH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=DpKAnvcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>did well, but not well enough to save Ubisoft from a grim year.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Ubisoft says it will continue its ongoing cost reduction program, as part of which the company hopes to slash "at least&nbsp;€200m" from its costs by the next financial year.</p>

<p>The studio says it's already achieved a reduction of "around&nbsp;€205 million" as of March 31st, but that a further&nbsp;€100m will need to be cut over the next two years, which means that we could see a repeat of the sweeping cuts that saw three Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">studios</a> close their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">doors</a> in the last six months or so.</p>

<p>Company CEO Yves Guillemot says the plan is to build "evergreen, billion-euro-brand ecosystems" based on Ubisoft's three most successful franchises:&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Far Cry</i>.</p>

<p>That's the rationale behind the creation of a brand new corporate entity for the company's core IP, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">first mooted back in March</a> before being made official later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=8iuSFH_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=VrilsPYK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is betting big on core franchises like&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its future.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot goes on to say that as part of a "review" of Ubisoft's "pipeline", the studio has made the decision to "provide additional development time to some of [its] biggest productions".</p>

<p>He doesn't name those productions, but upcoming titles include mobile game&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, so it's entirely possible that both of these productions will be delayed even further.</p>

<p>You can check out Ubisoft's <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full financial presentation here</a> if you want to read an overwhelming amount of corpo-speak (and look at some numbers as well, I suppose).</p>

The report said developers at Volition, having been big fans of the books, assembled a demo for a Harry Potter game in 1999. This was before the first movie came out in 2001, so the developers created their own ideas for what some of the characters might look like. It's also worth mentioning that Volition at the time was known as Parallax Software Corporation.</p><p>The demo included a sequence where Hagrid and Harry Potter are walking around a cobblestone area, with players able to switch between both characters in a top-down RPG setup. The demo doesn't include much in the way of activities, and that's because, Strong Museum's Andrew Borman said, Volition made it in a couple of weeks to pitch to the rights-holders. You can <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-zillion-years-before-hogwarts-legacy-pre-saints-row-volition-was-making-a-baldurs-gate-style-harry-potter-rpg-and-its-never-been-seen-by-the-public-before/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see images of the game at GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Borman said executives from the game developer and publisher attended a pitch meeting in which at least some of the top bosses "came dressed in robes and had owls with them" in an apparent bid to help win the rights.</p><p>Volition's pitch was not successful, and Electronic Arts ultimately won the Harry Potter gaming rights, releasing numerous movie tie-ins over the years.</p><p>The newest Harry Potter game is Hogwarts Legacy, which launched in 2023 to great success. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/" data-ref-id="2900-4951">the year's best-selling game overall</a>, even outselling the new Call of Duty game that year. 2024's Quidditch Champions game was less successful, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-gets-unexpected-update-connection-to-upcoming-show/1100-6527589/" data-ref-id="1100-6527589">a Hogwarts Legacy sequel is now on the way.</a></p><p>The Harry Potter universe was created by author J.K.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/super-smash-bros-dating-app-sent-cease-and-desist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A Super Smash Bros fan app that described itself as "the premium dating app for Smashers" has been blocked from release, its creator has said.
</p>
<p>
SmashTogether was first announced nearly a year ago, back in June 2024, and had this week been edging towards a beta release. 
</p>
<p>
24 hours from launch, Nintendo now appears to have stepped in, as SmashTogether's creator has suddenly reported receiving a notice demanding they cease and desist what they're doing (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-shuts-down-unofficial-smash-bros-dating-app-only-one-day-before-open-beta-launch/">Automaton</a>).
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>
There are lots of reasons why Nintendo likely thought SmashTogether - an app designed to pair up fans of its colourful fighting game filled with kid-friendly characters - was a terrible idea, probable copyright infringement being just one. 
</p>
<p>
Still, there will be some out there who were looking forward to SmashTogether being a thing. Indeed, earlier this week the app's creator announced they had already secured 400 pre-registrations from fans keen to play Smash with other Smash Bros aficionados, and then play smash with them after.
</p>
<p>
Sadly this means - look, let's just get this all out the way - Mario fans will no longer be able to lay pipe, Solid Snake lovers will no longer live up to the name, and you won't be able to browse King Dedede's D.
</p>
<p>
There have been no further updates from the SmashTogether creator since the announcement of that cease and desist, but we've contacted them for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's continually-busy legal team recently celebrated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">a "significant" win against piracy for the "entire games industry"</a> after squashing a file-sharing site used for illegal copies of games. The Mario maker is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">still going after monster battling game Palworld</a> for its various similarities to Pokémon.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Update: Atlus has now <a href="https://x.com/P5XOfficialWest/status/1923019286508880119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially confirmed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is launching on June 26th in the West. Original story follows below.</p>

<p>Original story: The release date for upcoming mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>appears to have been leaked ahead of an official reveal later today hat's likely to contain said information.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan site&nbsp;<a href="https://personacentral.com/p5x-english-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease" rel="nofollow">teased for a Western release earlier this week</a>, now has live listings across the Play Store, the App Store, and Steam. Apple's App Store is the one to give the game away, listing an expected release date of June 26th.</p>

<p>Of course, since neither the Steam page nor the Play Store listing have the same date, Apple's date could be a placeholder, but that seems unlikely given how oddly specific said date would be if it was just for demonstration purposes.</p>

You'll play as a new original character who's "thrust into a changed world drained of hope" following a "nightmare".</p>

<p>Before long, he meets an "eloquent owl named Lefaye" and "a long-nosed man" alongside a "beauty donned in blue", which presumably refers to Igor and his new assistant character. Evidently, twin youngsters Caroline and Justine will not be returning for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>.</p>

<p>Like the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, you'll be switching between the Metaverse and the real world, exploring dungeons and balancing your adventuring life with socializing and building relationships.</p>

<p>Combat will follow the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>&nbsp;rather than either of its spinoffs; it'll be a strictly turn-based affair, so don't expect to be doing any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers" rel="nofollow">real-time hack-and-slash-style fighting</a> or grid-based tactical strategizing here.</p>

We then had the pleasure of participating at a press panel with Soulframe creative director Geoff Crookes, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, community director Megan Everett, and Warframe principal writer Kat Kingsley to talk about development on the two games.</p><p dir="ltr">Warframe highlights included a new narrative chapter coming in June, the 61st Warframe Oraxia (aka Spiderframe), and a Primed version of the existing Warframe, Yareli. However, Soulframe is the big focus right now--the game is entering its 10th playtest, which heavily focuses on weapon customization.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Gotta catch ‘em all</h2><p dir="ltr">The latest Soulframe gameplay reveal includes an upgrade system that Sinclair claims is "not at all like Pokemon." In the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/soulframe-preludes-gameplay-spotlight-trailer/2300-6465971/">Soulframe: Preludes trailer,</a> you can see an example of a creature you can equip that looks like a googly-eyed spider (similar to the dust creatures in Spirited Away). The trailer also introduces sidearms, which are meant to be used alongside a primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now, Soulframe is in its 10th "Prelude"--its version of alpha testing. When asked about the focus of P10, Sinclair said, "It's really about weapon customization."</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still early in the game. We're changing a lot of things in the game, and I think we spent a lot more time than we expected to on fundamentals, where the game is one-third the speed of Warframe and it's a ton of melee focus, and that really took us a lot longer."</p><p dir="ltr">Creatures and sidearms further expand the loadout possibilities, so it isn't just a plug-and-play kind of game. It seems to require some critical thinking and encourages the player to get more creative beyond just hacking or shooting at an enemy to defeat it.</p><p dir="ltr">"For P10, you're going to have what is somewhere between a living monster and a mod, if you know Warframe," Sinclair said of the creature-collecting system. "So, you'll be collecting these [creatures] and that will give you a lot of different ways that your sword [could be] different [from] my sword. As you rank it up, it's going to have more things that you can upgrade and you'll be hunting around for these little guys and trying to capture them and put them into your weapons."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493"></a><figcaption>You can't have too many pets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's similar to the modding system in Warframe, which the team heavily drew inspiration from. However, in the same way Warframe doesn't want to repeat itself and make another time-travel story right away, Soulframe doesn't want to just copy and paste the mod system without thinking it through clearly. DE has already done something similar with its Soulframe Preludes, modifying existing features like factions in Warframe and recreating a similar but different version in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">As Crookes put it, "Warframe is just adrenaline. And [Soulframe's] slower, which fits with this pastoral romanticism, right? So we resisted having a secondary for a long time."</p><p dir="ltr">Its "pastoral romanticism" ties in with other Soulframe inspirations like Princess Mononoke, which was mentioned briefly in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soulframe-is-heavily-inspired-by-princess-mononoke-studio-ghibli-and-ico/1100-6517404/">our Soulframe interview from 2023</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I can't really get distinct with gameplay stuff," Crookes said about Mononoke-related inspirations, "but the animation reference is a big thing that we looked at. You know, like the corruption on [Prince Ashitaka's] arm and the violence that that created, and there's a contrast between those things."</p><p dir="ltr">He brought up pacts, Soulframe's equivalent of Warframe's frames, which also drew inspiration from Mononoke. "Pacts are the thing you equip, and it gives you your power set and your class. So we're always kind of thinking about how that theme and that dynamic kind of is specific to the world that it comes from and what the contrast is with that."</p><p dir="ltr">In that sense, it's hard to pinpoint the exact idea of pacts from the overall theme of Mononoke's emphasis on the might of nature. "So there's nothing really kind of like that we can rip out from one another. You destroy pollution. You heal the land. Save animals," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494"></a><figcaption>Soulframe drops the futuristic frames for the more fantastical pacts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Forever alone gamers</h2><p dir="ltr">Digital Extremes hasn't announced the specifics when it comes to the social features in Soulframe, but Crookes did confirm that they aimed to make the game enjoyable for both solo and co-op players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah, the co-op is a huge part of it, but I don't think we're going to make it mandatory," he said. "We're putting out a community event now that will encourage collaboration with the community, but a lot of people in the studio call themselves forever-alone gamers. When they play online, they're like...Together alone."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sinclair, about 25% of Warframe's players exclusively play solo and they let them do as they please, so they are taking the same approach with Soulframe. That said, the team encourages players to try co-op when they can. One of these co-op features takes advantage of the theme of ancestry in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying something really soft [to] push people into the co-op who normally shy away from it. We want to encourage [people to see the] benefits of meeting players in the world," Crookes said. "We have this theme of ancestry in the game that we have in there right now as a light foundation that we want to build on, so that if you have a family history with another player in the game world, there might be certain benefits to share from each other when you play together."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492" data-ratio="0.56230747689723" data-width="3571" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492"></a><figcaption>The best of friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">He also mentions adding message boards in the game, though they realize it's a "brave" thing to do because they need to trust players to give them full freedom over their messages (instead of, for example, pre-set messages). As for other cooperative gameplay features, Soulframe has factions called "enclaves" and hubs that you can join to socialize with people who are in a similar guild.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to try to reinforce people helping each other out in the game by leaving hints or suggestions or things that help people in certain zones in the overworld," Crookes said.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is far from finished, but Digital Extremes has been very open about its development. It credits a lot of the progress it's made on Soulframe so far to the early players that spent hours on the game and gave in-depth feedback on what to improve.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started this game, a lot of people said this can't work again," said Sinclair. "Like the world's different, you can't do Warframe again--[you can't] release a small game, get a community, [and] focus on community rather than focus on having 500 hours of content, and we said, 'No, we think that can work again.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"We tend to be more insecure about our product than we should be," he admitted. "So I think, when we were talking about making the intro to Soulframe, we were thinking, 'Okay, we've got to make a two-hour single-player quest to introduce them to the world and get people to understand the setting and the conflicts, and then open the gates for them.'"</p><p dir="ltr">However, when the team was actually getting the game live, they realized that this approach wouldn't work. "We [were] like, 'No, we're going to hurt the game if we do this, and we need to kind of embrace what we're doing right with Warframe, but just kind of think about the new player experience a bit more.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495" data-ratio="0.56253776435045" data-width="1655" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495"></a><figcaption>Soulframe is more than a little different from Warframe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is a much different game than Warframe, so it wasn't always possible to create a rewarding experience by following the same path, like the adjustments they needed to make to game speed early in development. That adjustment continues to be a struggle years later. Sinclair mentions a time last year where they were "torn to shreds" because of a faulty Soulframe demo and decided that they should slow down development considerably to focus on perfecting the fundamentals. Because of that, they've just started to flesh out things like weapon customization and build crafting. The creatures shown in the latest trailer are a part of that.</p><p dir="ltr">"Warframe is a huge power fantasy, whereas [in] Soulframe, the time to kill one enemy is dramatically different, which means you can really look at every frame of the animation--the foot clipping in the ground--and I think that's what really bummed me out about last year's TennoCon," said Sinclair.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was very proud of what we showed. It's a smaller team, [and they] made it very quickly. The Nimrod, Verminia, all that shit, the dynamic weather things that happen, [all of that] really, really cool stuff… But one enemy slipped through a wall, and it was like, 'This game is jank, right?' It took us a few months to recover from that. Just in terms of headspace and morale."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the goals DE has for itself is committing to a structured schedule for Soulframe like it already has for Warframe. As Sinclair said, "We really got a bit of a bad habit last year with our Prelude's updates where we keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it. You see what Warframe is doing and how fast it's going."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's like, okay, remember, we're still DE. We still have to really make sure we're not biting off too much and getting interesting work."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is currently in development for PC. Digital Extremes hints at more to come during TennoCon 2025 in July.</p>

                <p>Today marks the official launch of Nubs!: Arena, a chaotic arena brawler developed by Glowfish Interactive and Rangatang. Anywhere from four to 20 players can battle each other or team up in the game. And the devs are so eager to introduce players to Nubs!: Arena that they are giving it away for free for the next 24 hours.</p><p>Players who want to give Nubs!: Arena a shot only need to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337860/Nubs_Arena/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit its Steam page</a> and claim it before the free promotion ends tomorrow, May 16. The launch trailer for Nubs!: Arena has also been released to give everyone a taste of the party-style brawl that awaits them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCsUuBaMdQo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bCsUuBaMdQo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This game supports local co-op with up to four players, while 20 players is the limit online. There are numerous traps and power-ups in the arena, and knocked-out player-characters are actually transformed into stars. The players can still run while turned into a star, and they're going to have to put their legs to the test. Because if any of the other players capture the stars before they respawn as their regular character, then the corresponding player is eliminated from the game.</p><p>Nubs!: Arena includes a number of strange and absurd weapons and power-ups, and players will be able to extensively customize their characters. The game also features roguelite progression and each match is fast-paced to keep the action moving for casual gamers.</p><p>In other free-game news, PlayStation Plus subscribers can now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">grab their free games for May</a>, including Ark: Survival Evolved.

                <p>Death Stranding was a polarizing game when it was first released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">but for the upcoming sequel</a>, previews and early reviews for the game have largely been positive. In a recent interview, game director Hideo Kojima explained how he was happy to see test audiences react more favorably to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, but he also explained how this had left him feeling conflicted.</p><p>"Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish I was a bit more controversial," Kojima said to Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Blockbuster films need an 80% approval rating--I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market or selling millions of copies. That’s not what I'm aiming for."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima did acknowledge the paradox of this approach, as while he may not be aiming to appeal to the broader gaming market, Death Stranding 2 still needs to sell a sizable number of units if he wants to keep the lights on at Kojima Productions and pay his staff. The other benefit to reviews being divided over a game is that it allows a developer like Kojima to receive constructive criticism and implement improvements, both in the base game and a potential sequel. At the same time, Kojima says that he won't alter themes or story based on feedback from players.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a> is a good example of this approach, as it added new content and quality-of-life improvements to the game while keeping the story intact. Death Stranding 2 also appears to have taken a considerable amount of feedback into account, as the game is aiming to appeal to a broader range of players with a more action-focused direction.</p><p>"Once I retrained myself to play it as a stealth-action game, it greatly improved my enjoyment and I started looking forward to camps of enemies," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>. "Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back."</p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on June 24 for PS5, and if you're looking to play it in style, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">preorder a limited-edition DualSense controller</a> inspired by the game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-knows-what-death-stranding-3-could-be-but-he-wont-make-it-himself/1100-6531404/">Kojima also spoke about the possibility of Death Stranding 3</a>, but he'd like to pass the development baton to someone else for the potential threequel.</p>
