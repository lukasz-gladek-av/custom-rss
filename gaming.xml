			<p>Among the best and most unexpected modding projects to launch this year was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, which brings some stunning visual improvements to one of the most popular role-playing games released this year, as highlighted by a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The end of 2024 montage shared by the project's developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> does an excellent job highlighting the improvements the mod currently brings to the game in pretty much every location in the game. From higher texture quality to improved lighting and much more, the fan-made project looks every bit as good as any proper remaster should.</p>

<p>The development of the Bloodborne Remaster Project was made possible by the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, which allows users to play the game developed by FromSoftware on PC even without an official port. A new version of the emulator bringing a variety of improvements was released <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/12/25/shadps4-v0-5-0-christmas-2024-release/">last week</a>, and made two more PlayStation 4 exclusives playable on PC - Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and The Witch &amp; The Hundred Knight 2. You can check out how the emulator runs both games in the videos below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

My enemies no longer look like your average tough guys on the street—their eyes glow red, they’re able to spew toxic fumes at me. But their new monstrous appearance is no match for my sweet selection of skills, my trusty baseball bat, and a crew of comrades who are ready to dive in with their own eccentric combat skills.

But as I turn the next corner of clouding darkness, a bright red light paralyzes me as the forceful and commanding voice of my father tells me that not only am I doomed to fail in my struggles, but that I am actively causing the very harm I am seeking to alleviate. Be it through failure or a curse that he expects me to believe I carry with me that will spread to others, he calls me his daughter with a possessiveness that rattles me. It inspires fear and rage. Yet I continue to move forward, to find a way through, to find spaces where his corruption hasn’t spread. And I do this not only for myself, but for others to whom I have promised aid. But in my quest to kill godlike forces that are causing misery, I am ever aware of a creeping darkness that threatens to consume me and others. What must I do to heal this world? Is that  what I’m here to do? Can I do this? As I hear my father’s voice again, reminding me of his abuse, I realize I have no choice. I <em>must</em> survive and bring an end to the suffering of all those I encounter. — Claire Jackson</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-recommend-id="image://275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-recommend-id="image://275ec5273d6c9761b0ef08e4476c1aba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eerie glow eminates from behind a door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As I peer out from a ventilation shaft to catch sight of the unspeakable horror in search of me, I prepare to toss a wrench I lifted from the ground in the desperate hope of distracting it.

I carry my share of the blame, but it’s clear the gods must pay for what they’ve done to us. There’s a path to seeking justice, and it must be cut through legions of monsters, human and undead alike. I’m up to the task, equipped with strength, resolve, and help from an unlikely source. With each foe I strike down, I learn more about myself. I learn that I’m not powerless. States of failure and struggle aren’t permanent. Nothing will stand in my way.  — Claire Jackson</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f56e54f2b69f72230403022fd72c84da" data-recommend-id="image://f56e54f2b69f72230403022fd72c84da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A screenshot of Luisa looking at a portal.

And with a great, young cast that includes <em>Civil War</em>’s Cailee Spaeny and <em>The Last of Us’ </em>Isabela Merced, <em>Romulus</em> feels like it’s courting both the original <em>Alien</em> lovers and a younger, fresher group of potential fans.

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-recommend-id="image://5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-recommend-id="image://5ffd86b36b34b29aaeff0f788826d8f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aigis looks sadly at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As a “definitive” edition of the phenomenal 2006 RPG, 2024’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a></span> was lacking in a few key features like the 2009 PSP port’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-female-protagonist-portable-kotone-1851272602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-female-protagonist-portable-kotone-1851272602">female protagonist route</a></span>.

However, with 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, it seemed more vital than ever that BioWare not do this, as the studio ended that game with a devastating cliffhanger that saw your hero, the Inquisitor, locked in a battle of ideals with Solas, the elven mage party member who, at the game’s conclusion, is revealed to be an elven god. Surely, I thought, switching to a new protagonist now and sidelining the hero through whom we’d become so engaged in this conflict would result in a failure to do right by this story I’d been waiting a decade to see conclude. I’m happy to say I was wrong. When I rolled credits on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, I felt something I hadn’t felt for <em>Dragon Age</em> in a long time: hope. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="657eda30c6915fb35a0565925135520d" data-recommend-id="image://657eda30c6915fb35a0565925135520d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Caulfield in closeup, the wintry campus environment around her slightly distorted by her powers.

I think that, for many of the millions of players it resonated with, <em>Life Is Strange </em>spoke to those parts of us that are still as young as Max was, those parts of us that still remember the incredible intensity of teenage longing, and still know that the right wistful indie pop song in the golden hour of the evening can just about break your heart. Now, Max is back, a little older, a little different from the person she once was, in <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. While some fans of the original may be disappointed to see the way the intervening years have shaped Max, it’s a worthy sequel that gives her, and us, a thoughtful reckoning with the toll life takes on us and the pain that often goes hand-in-hand with growth. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c1dcea5d752db8e89c47bd10abe2d07" data-recommend-id="image://7c1dcea5d752db8e89c47bd10abe2d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy cheers and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aloy cheers and looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c1dcea5d752db8e89c47bd10abe2d07" data-recommend-id="image://7c1dcea5d752db8e89c47bd10abe2d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aloy cheers and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I really liked <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, a game that’s exactly what it sounds like.

And this latest film succeeds. <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of the most beloved stories in all of the series’ 30 years. While the film does tweak some things along the way, it doesn’t shy away from the otherworldly, supercharged melodrama that differentiated <em>Sonic </em>from its contemporaries in the early 2000s. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>still falls into the occasional trap of talking down to the all-ages audience with low-hanging jokes and some frankly groan-worthy segments, but more than ever, the third film earns the right to delve into the video game excess that made these characters so beloved in the first place. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looked like <em>such</em> a blatant clone of Valve’s Steam Deck interface. Its many bugs kept me at bay.</p><p>Now, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> running <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> has all but replaced the Steam Deck in my life. For the moment, it may be the best handheld your time and money can buy — because it brings 90 percent of the Deck’s ease of use to the Ally’s more powerful hardware, larger 80 watt-hour battery, and variable refresh rate screen. Depending on the game, it can even offer <em>better</em> performance and battery life than the very same handheld with Windows. I’ve been testing it for five months, and I’ve rarely looked back.</p><p>This combination won’t be for everyone, because the $800 Ally X costs far more than a Steam Deck, and Bazzite still has annoying quirks. But because Bazzite can so convincingly transform a Windows handheld into a true Steam Deck rival, I believe it singlehandedly proves that handheld manufacturers are making the wrong choice if they doggedly stick with Windows, and that others should <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors">join Lenovo in hedging that bet</a> as soon as possible. Bazzite is one way — another may come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">as soon as next month</a>, when we’re expecting Valve to open up its SteamOS to more partners.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">review</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">review</a> of handheld gaming PC, I’ve tried to explain: Windows isn’t a good portable gaming experience. It’s bloated, full of self-serving prompts to share your data with Microsoft, subscribe to Microsoft’s services, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23935029/microsoft-edge-forced-windows-10-google-chrome-fight">use Microsoft’s apps</a>. It’s not designed to let you navigate with gamepad controls or even do simple keyboarding on a 7-inch touchscreen display. It’s not good at making sure games launch full-screen, and worst of all, I’ve never been able to trust a Windows handheld to sleep and resume properly when I drop it into a bag.</p><p>The Steam Deck, with its Linux-based SteamOS, has no such problems. It’s <em>far</em> closer to the “it just works” experience of a Nintendo Switch or PS5. I know my game will almost always be ready to play as soon as I hit the power button, and there’s a gamepad-accessible keyboard ready to go whenever I like. But SteamOS hasn’t been broadly available for <em>other</em> company’s handhelds — which brings us to Bazzite.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">open-source Bazzite</a> is a way to bring SteamOS’s strengths to hardware that doesn’t yet have Valve’s blessing. It’s not <em>technically</em> SteamOS, as it’s based on Fedora Linux rather than Arch Linux, contains many different and/or updated components and a lot of custom tweaks. But it plays the same games the same exact way, and the parts you touch are sometimes even laughably the same. Bazzite includes an exact copy of the Steam Deck’s UI right down to Valve’s own tutorial on how to use the Steam Deck’s buttons — all of which should theoretically be OK with Valve, as it expressly allows anyone to distribute an unlimited number of copies of that software <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2Fdownload%3Fver%3Dsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3DLimited%2520Redistribution%2520License">under a limited license</a>.</p><p>Despite what you may have heard, it’s not true that Windows handhelds offer more games than SteamOS. Not only does Valve’s Proton compatibility layer run many Windows games <em>better</em> than on an equivalent Windows handheld, many titles that are broken and abandoned on Windows have already been fixed by the Linux community. While the Linux-based SteamOS does have fewer popular multiplayer shooting games because publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">aren’t willing or able to offer the same anti-cheat solutions</a>, I’ve found it’s a small price to pay.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Handheld Daemon, accessible with a double-tap of the Quick Access Menu key just below the Start button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To me, the surprising part is that Bazzite doesn’t feel like a hack. For me, it’s been so much more reliable than Windows that it makes Windows feel foreign on handhelds, even though I use Windows on my desktop every single day. And it’s fairly easy to set up, with its own installer that walks you through setup. You can even competently dual-boot Bazzite alongside Windows, holding down your handheld’s boot menu shortcut button(s) when you restart to swap between the two.</p><p>And when I did that with the Asus ROG Ally X, directly comparing Bazzite and Windows, I often found games ran<em> faster</em>, smoother, <em>and</em> used slightly less power with Bazzite’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p>It’s not night and day. While I saw up to 13 percent faster performance in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em>, sometimes performance was identical in other games. In <em>Returnal</em>, the particularly demanding game where you crash-land on an alien planet full of destructible objects and swarming enemies, my framerate was initially worse, though a recent update put it on par; in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, my framerate was initially better but an update has now made it worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with games that are 13 percent faster, we’re generally just talking about a small handful of frames; I never saw enough speed increase that a game became playable on Bazzite that wasn’t playable on Windows through faster framerate alone.</p><div><p><em>All games tested at 720p low. </em></p></div><p>But they do often feel smoother, with fewer hitches! Like the Steam Deck, I notice that framerate doesn’t typically dip as low with Bazzite as it does with Windows. Many feel faster and look better on the Ally X than on the Steam Deck OLED, too, because of the faster chip and especially the variable refresh rate screen, which lets the Ally display every frame its processors can generate instead of capping at an arbitrary number that might feel choppy. (It’s a killer feature for GPU-limited handhelds, and it’s a big deal that Bazzite supports it today.)</p><p>Similarly, I didn’t see battery life savings in <em>every</em> game. I sometimes watch the Ally X drain its battery one, two, even three watts slower on Bazzite than on Windows when I set the chips to identical power levels, but that’s not always the case. In <em>Dirt Rally</em>, I saw an identical 3 hours, 8 minutes from both operating systems, and both <em>Armored Core 6</em> and <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> drained the Ally at the same speed, each offering three hours of play. But in <em>Dave the Diver</em>, I was able to make Bazzite last nearly an extra hour at 4 hours, 14 minutes, far closer to my 4 hour, 42-minute result with the Steam Deck OLED.</p><p>That’s because like SteamOS, Bazzite makes it easy to tweak how much power and performance you’re using on the fly. Not only does Bazzite have the same built-in Gamescope monitoring tool Valve uses on the Steam Deck, you can also double-tap the Ally X’s quick access button to pull up an integrated version of Handheld Daemon, a power user tool that lets you change your chip’s exact TDP to toggle turbo or battery savings (or RGB lighting, or rumble, or many more) in a snap.</p><p>Frankly, the interface is more responsive and reliable than Asus’ own Armory Crate UI overlay, though it can’t quite do everything that Asus does with its own hardware. Two key examples: the Ally X’s rear macro buttons don’t work unless you instruct Handheld Daemon to emulate a Sony DualSense Edge controller, which is easy but can mean mismatched button prompts in some games. And you can’t hold down the power button to quickly access the Linux desktop mode or a shutdown menu.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Steam can recognize the back buttons of </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review"><em>Sony’s fancy PS5 pad</em></a><em>, so here Bazzite is telling it that the ROG Ally’s buttons are coming from that one.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But using those chip wattage adjustments, I easily managed to improve battery life even further than Windows in some of the least demanding games I test, ones where the Steam Deck has generally run circles around the competition in the past. In both <em>Balatro</em> and <em>Slay the Spire</em>, I got the handheld’s total battery drain down to just 6.4 watts by setting the chip to 5 watts and dimming screen brightness to minimum, which theoretically gives you a maximum of 12.5 hours from the 80 watt-hour pack. That is class-leading battery life, folks — even better than the Steam Deck OLED.</p><p>And when you need more performance, the Ally X has the battery to take it places the Deck OLED can’t comfortably compete. When I set the Ally X to its 25W “Turbo” mode, I get over two hours of <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and nearly two hours of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, at a very playable 900p resolution with a “Balanced” level of render scaling. (If you can tolerate a lower-res picture, you can get nearly three hours of <em>BG3</em> at 17W TDP.)</p><p>In short, I don’t worry about the Ally X’s battery with Bazzite any more than I do with the Steam Deck OLED, particularly since Bazzite added support for the ROG Ally X’s extreme standby mode where I find I only lose four percent battery overnight.</p><p>But there are things I do miss about the Steam Deck OLED and its native SteamOS. While Bazzite does include Steam’s wonderful controller remapping and support the ROG Ally X’s gyroscope for precision aiming, it doesn’t magically give it a pair of twin touchpads to make generations of older mouse-and-trackball games work. You don’t get the Deck OLED’s slightly larger screen with more vibrant colors and brilliant HDR light. I personally still think the Deck has better ergonomics, too, though the Ally X is certainly my second favorite among today’s leading handhelds.</p><p>The gamepad controls also sometimes take a little bit longer to come back to life after resuming from sleep, even without extreme standby turned on. Bluetooth microphone support seems entirely borked in Bazzite. Sometimes there’s a long delay when I’m trying to uninstall a game before the system responds. Whenever there’s a Bazzite update, I’ll uselessly see Valve’s last update message instead of Bazzite’s and have no idea what I’m about to get. Occasionally I see performance take a turn for the worse after an update, like how <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> is suddenly giving me lower framerate than with Windows. And it’s difficult to tell how long a system update will take to install.</p><p>Also, there’s a weird issue where if I almost fully drain the battery, down to 1 percent or 0 percent, the whole system will slow to such a painful crawl it can take 10 minutes just to save your game and shut the Ally X down. And I need to shut it down, because even charging to 100 percent doesn’t speed things up again. This is easy enough to prevent by simply plugging in the system at the five percent or three percent mark, like you’d need to do anyway with most other handhelds.</p><p>I’ve told Bazzite’s maintainers about these things, and they say they’re working on them — including a hibernation mode that should alleviate the 0-percent charging quirk in particular, and more intuitive updates. “We have also been improving support for other manufacturers, especially OneXPlayer, and for the next update GPD,” adds Antheas Kapenekakis, a Bazzite contributor who’s also the lead developer of Handheld Daemon.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think I would personally buy an Asus ROG Ally X over a Steam Deck, at least not now. At $800, it costs nearly twice the price of a base Steam Deck, and hundreds more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the OLED version I personally recommend</a>. To be worth all that extra money, I’d want to know the ROG Ally X isn’t just the best handheld today, but also the best handheld tomorrow. I would personally wait to see a new crop of handhelds at CES in January, and hear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft">what Valve, Microsoft, AMD and Lenovo have to say at their January 7th event</a>.</p><p>But if I already owned an Asus ROG Ally X, or regular Ally, or the Lenovo Legion Go, I would absolutely install Bazzite on it right away, perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dual+boot+bazzite">using a dual-boot configuration</a> to make sure I can easily swap back. You might be surprised by how little you’ll miss Windows. You might be surprised by just how much better the portable experience can get.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When it comes to video games, 2024 wasn’t just another year. It truly was a standout year for games over the last decade. Yes, we’ve heard that sentiment before, but this time it felt different. This year brought a wave of incredible experiences, with something for everyone. From the smallest indie gems to blockbuster AAA titles, the gaming landscape was full of great titles.</p>



<p>Games like Helldivers 2, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, and STALKER 2 dominated conversations at various points throughout the year. But one game managed to capture the hearts of the Insider Gaming community above all others. That game, and the Insider Gaming Community’s 2024 Game of the Year, is Astro Bot. </p>



<p>In a tightly-contested vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, the race came down to two favorites: Astro Bot and Balatro. In the end, Astro Bot edged out the poker-themed roguelike, claiming 37% of the vote compared to Balatro’s 33%.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-makes-astro-bot-so-special">What Makes Astro Bot So Special?</h3>



<p>This isn’t just another <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">3D platformer</a>; it’s a love letter to PlayStation’s legacy. With stunning visuals steeped in nostalgia, Astro Bot takes you on a journey through PlayStation’s storied history. Its level designs are masterfully varied, ensuring that no two stages ever feel the same.</p>



<p>From a gameplay perspective, it’s pure fun and, arguably, the most enjoyable 3D platforming experience on PlayStation since the early days of Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. The game is packed with inventive mechanics, each one thoughtfully designed to keep things fresh. Whether you’re wielding Aloy’s bow or transforming into a sponge to soak up water and grow in size, every moment feels like a perfect fit for the worlds Team Asobi created. Importantly, nothing is overused, so the game always feels engaging and never overstays its welcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-return-to-gaming-s-roots">A Return to Gaming’s Roots</h3>



<p>But what truly sets Astro Bot apart is the way it makes you feel. It’s a throwback to the golden age of gaming—a traditional 3D platformer without the clutter of microtransactions or overwhelming bloat. It’s just long enough to satisfy, but never so drawn out that it becomes a slog. Playing Astro Bot feels like revisiting the essence of what made so many of us fall in love with video games in the first place. Even the game’s soundtrack evokes a feeling of yesteryear while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Astro Bot as the Game of the Year, or is there another 2024 standout that stole your heart? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

			<p>The first and only Grand Theft Auto 6 currently available has been found online in better quality, allowing fans to better appreciate its stunning visuals while they wait for Rockstar Games to finally show more of their highly anticipated open-world game.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/GTASixInfo/status/1873532834838900846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873532834838900846%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GTASixInfo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GameRollGTA</a> discovered a higher-quality version of the new trailer<span>&nbsp;compared to the one available on YouTube. This new version of the trailer, which was originally streamed on Chinese video streaming service BiliBili and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLzVdNhcdtwUvWkDA-9_ZrBpzAcc0bDl/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, has a higher bitrate than the YouTube version, which</span>&nbsp;makes it easier to appreciate some of the visual's finer details.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the release of the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, but the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games continues to become bigger by the day. Its release is expected by analysts to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch to date</a>, and its<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/"> release window will have an impact on the entire video game industry</a>, as other publishers are aiming to launch their games as far away from it as possible and are holding back setting release dates for them until Rockstar Games finally confirms if the game is indeed launching in late 2025, or if it will be delayed to 2026, which is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">definite possibility</a>, considering the game's scope.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Half-Life 3 has moved to its next round of playtesting, it has been claimed.</p>



<p>That’s according to Gabe Follower, who has a history of leaking similar information on previous Valve titles, most notably Deadlock last year.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI&amp;ab_channel=GabeFollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gabe Follower</a>, his sources have revealed that HLX (Half-Life 3) started playtests for Family and Friends of Valve developers in the past few months. </p>



<p>While the information doesn’t give us much information into what Half-Life 3 entails, it does tell us that the project is now at a fundamental stage of development and could see the game delayed further if it does not resonate well with the new playtests. </p>



<p>Previously, Valve delayed Half Life Alyx, its VR game, for one year to re-write the story. Deadlock, Valve’s upcoming team-based multiplayer shooter, also saw several delays due to feedback during these sessions. </p>



<p>The playtests do tell us that Half-Life 3 could be nearing its announcement soon, though, presumably sometime during 2025. If not, well, it’s entirely possible that the game could leak online due to the game now being accessed by more people.</p>



<p>As for when Half-Life 3 will be released, it remains to be seen, but Gabe Follower’s claims suggest that the game is progressing well.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake series could cease to be a PlayStation console exclusive in 2025, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://br.ign.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/134307/news/nao-podemos-ser-exclusivos-de-um-unico-console-diretor-de-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-diz-que-numeros-de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Brazil</a> during The Game Awards 2024, Remake series producer Yoshinori Kitase commented on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales and console exclusivity. While sales of the second entry in the series are deemed satisfactory despite the game not meeting profit expectations following launch, Kitase-san commented that it has become clear that modern games can no longer be exclusive to a single platform and that they need to be offered to as many players as possible.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Kitase isn't the only member of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series development team whose comments suggest the series could be coming to other platforms in the future. Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241216014/index_5.html#sqe_ham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> as part of their end-of-the-year developer roundup, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi stated that the team will continue to take on the challenge of bringing the series to as many fans as possible in 2025. As the second entry in the series is coming to PC in less than a month, it's evident how Hamaguchi-san is likely talking about other platforms as well, such as the Xbox Series X and S and the Nintendo Switch 2, which should be able to handle both games with some compromises in terms of visuals and performance if the leaked specs are real.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it won't take too long for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series to be released on other platforms, as the first two entries in the series are excellent games that deserve to be experienced by any JRPG fan. You can learn more about the first entry by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">my review</a> and about Rebirth by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/complete-rt-shader-1-6-promises-3x-faster-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Path of Exile 2 Class Tier List in Early Access]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access.1071168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/our-path-of-exile-2-class-tier-list-in-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>No matter when you dive into Path of Exile 2, chances are you want to know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-become-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game going free-to-play</a>, right? Then, you can finally convince your friends to play!</p>

<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>

<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Lucasfilm</span><span>|</span><span><p>Harrison Ford (L), cinematographer Douglas Slocombe (C) and director Steven Spielberg (R) on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>There are loads of great things about <em>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</em>, loads of very immersive<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and funny things</a>, but one&nbsp; thing you notice before anything else—and this is obvious even from watching trailers, let alone playing the game is that it's visually breath-taking. I don't want to take anything away from the amazing animators and modellers and concept artists who worked on it, the whole game looks incredible, but for this blog in particular I wanted to talk about how <em>Great Circle</em> (and particularly its many, many cutscenes) has been framed and lit.</p><p>There are moments playing and watching this game when I've simply taken my hands off the keyboard and mouse and gasped. So many moments when what I'm seeing on the screen looks cinematic not in the over-used video game sense of the word, but in actual motion picture sense of the word.</p><p>There are of course good reasons for this! <em>Great Circle</em> is, if nothing else, a painstaking labour of love from a team who knows exactly what makes <em>Indiana Jones</em> tick. It's an adaptation that hasn't just slapped a license on a generic experience, it's been designed from the ground up to make you feel like you're spending hours in Dr. Jones' shoes. The game's music is the music you remember from the films, Troy Baker's voice acting is perfect and even stuff like the animation is a work of reverence, nailing Harrison Ford's mannerisms down to the most minute detail, from his smirks to his finger-wagging.</p><p>That love can also be found in the game's eye for the cinematic. Watching <em>Great Circle</em>--the framing, the colours, the lighting, the emphasis--looks just like watching an actual <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, or at least it looks like watching the first three films, which all featured the cinematography of Douglas Slocombe, a legend in the field who was nominated for three Academy Awards across a career that saw him work on everything from <em>The Italian Job</em> to <em>Rollerball </em>to <em>The Great Gatsby</em> to <em>Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</em>.</p><p>It's the latter where Slocombe first met Steven Spielberg, and the director was so impressed that he brought Slocombe on to work on 1981's <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, a film that Spielberg thought he had very specific noir-like ideas for, but whose look ultimately gave way to something else when running into Slocombe's penchant for practical considerations and high contrast shooting.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Beauty Of Indiana Jones" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zZaIvckiqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Spielberg recalled this transition in 2017,<a href="https://theasc.com/articles/flashback-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-directing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in a feature he wrote for American Cinematographer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I originally wanted a much moodier, almost neo-Brechtian style of light and shadow for this film. I wanted the film to resemble more, say The Informer — the film being more film noir than I eventually accomplished. But I found that the movie was beginning to paint itself out of the corner I put it in, by the kind of sketchy brightness which is Dougie's forte and I began to see what Dougie was doing. He was giving it a fuller look, not a flat look; he was giving it a very nice backlit look, but a very full backlit look and because of that he was getting amazing depth of field due to the number of lights he was using. In the dailies, of course, it looks very dark and moody and atmospheric, while on the set it looked very bright, but he was not shooting wide open, to say the least. He was stopping down. So between my original discussions with Dougie about film noir and subsequent results from our collaboration, and seeing a couple of days' dailies that looked kind of sketchy — very sketchy — perhaps film noir, and then seeing other scenes that were fatter and richer in contrast, I began to say, "Hey, this movie is much prettier in color than it is in black-and-white."</p><p>I believe that the photographic style of this movie happened by itself through an interesting compromise between what Dougie loves to do and what I wanted from him. We each came halfway and we found what will now be, hopefully, the continuing style of the Raiders saga.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The result was a trilogy with a visual style so distinctive that Slocombe was nominated for an Oscar in 19081 for his work on <em>Raiders</em>, and one so memorable that someone like me with only a passing knowledge of the films and the people who made them could look at <em>Great Circle's</em> cutscenes and think, boy, they sure do look like they're shot exactly the same as those movies they're based on. Just like the early films, <em>Great Circle</em> features a ton of heavy contrast, a lot of incredibly moody lighting relying on candles and sunlight, loads of thick shadows and plenty of very, very close shots of Indiana's face.</p><p><em>Raiders</em> went on to become Slocombe's most recognised work (<a href="https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/douglas-slocombe-obe-bsc-raiders-of-the-lost-arc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it cost him the use of one eye after a freak jeep accident!</a>) and while he's sadly no longer with us--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/douglas-slocombe-obituary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he lived until the grand old age of 103, only passing away in 2016</a>--the fact he left behind such a legacy while being self-taught is incredible. How many other cinematographers do you even <em>know</em>, let alone could so quickly point to the visual signature they've left behind on modern pop culture?</p><p>It's impossible to play <em>Great Circle</em> and not see Machinegames' best attempts at building on that legacy. Just look at some of these shots! Most are from cutscenes where the inspiration can be most literally seen, but there are even moments during gameplay when some light pours through a mysterious tomb's door and you think, uh huh, this is <em>Indiana Jones</em> all right. When you're watching something like this and John Williams' score kicks in and Troy Baker is channelling Harrison Ford you realise this isn't just something cashing in on a beloved license, it genuinely understands every aspect of it and feels like a continuation that could have involved Spielberg and George Lucas themselves.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>I've read reviews of this game that are almost critical of <em>Great Circle's </em>cutscenes; they wish this had been a movie and not a game, or that the cutscenes had focused less on action scenes and allowed the player more agency over them. I think Machinegames got the balance just right, because the cutscenes here don't feel like a lesser version of Indy's story, they feel like a thoughtful continuation of it, in ways infinitely preferable to sitting down and watching the last two dogshit movies.</p><p><em>Great Circle</em> is an adaptation so considerate and understanding of the source material that it didn't just stop at copying Indy's voice and hat, it made sure his mannerisms were correct,<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that his limitations were made clear</a>, that the music was perfect and that down to the most minute, oft-overlooked detail--like the lens through which we view the action and the cutscenes--it understood what made Indiana Jones <em>Indiana Jones</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG isn’t waiting until CES begins to <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/12/lg-unveils-worlds-first-bendable-5k2k-gaming-monitor-winner-of-three-awards-at-ces-2025/">reveal its new collection of gaming monitors</a>. The 2025 lineup is led by the UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor, which LG claims is the “world’s first 5K2K-resolution bendable OLED display.” That strikes me as extremely specific, but hey, it’s always worth bragging when you’re first, I suppose. The 45-inch monitor has an expansive resolution of 5120x2160, so you’re getting the same vertical pixel count as a typical 4K screen but a much wider canvas to game on.</p><p>And with a 21:9 aspect ratio, LG believes it provides “a more immersive gaming experience than standard 16:9 displays, while maintaining better content compatibility than 32:9 monitors.” This format also makes the display a great fit for productivity work when you’re not immersed in gameplay.</p><p>The UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor (model 45GX990A) can transition from completely&nbsp;flat to a 900R curvature, and the latest version of LG’s Dual-Mode feature “allows users to switch effortlessly between resolution and refresh rate presets, and customize the&nbsp;aspect ratio and picture size.” It’s certified for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, but the press materials don’t specify a maximum refresh rate. I’ve asked for more details there.</p><div><figcaption><em>Both 45-inch monitors have a 5K2K resolution of 5120x2160.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>LG is also releasing a non-bendable model with a permanent 800R curve. Otherwise, it’s the same 45-inch size, same aspect ratio, and same 5K2K resolution. LG’s press release says you can expect “sharp, lifelike images with the stunning colors and exceptional contrast LG OLED products are known for.” Shared specs between both monitors include a 0.03ms (GtG) response time and support for DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C with 90W power delivery. The 45GX950A uses a RGWB subpixel layout to improve readability of text on the screen and make the aforementioned productivity work easier on your eyes. </p><p>Along with these two monitors, LG is also introducing the curved UltraGear 39GX90SA, a webOS-powered “home entertainment hub” with easy access to streaming services — just like LG’s TVs. It seems like the company has taken some cues from Samsung’s smart monitors here. At 39 inches, this one’s a bit smaller than the other GX9 displays, but it retains the 21:9 aspect ratio and 800R curve. “Equipped with USB Type-C ports, it offers convenient connectivity, and incorporates LG’s ergonomic and space-saving L-shaped stand for a clutter-free desk setup,” LG said in tonight’s press release.</p><p>As per usual with CES news, pricing and a specific release date are still to come later in 2025. But we’ll be getting our first in-person look at the UltraGear GX9 series in Las Vegas, so stay tuned for impressions early next month — along with an avalanche of stunning screens from many other companies, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

              <section>

                <p><strong>S<em>poilers for Final Fantasy VII [1997], Remake, and Rebirth.</em></strong></p><p dir="ltr">Even with far more barriers in the way, the desperation began almost as soon as the original game was on shelves and the first person saw Aerith die in Final Fantasy VII. The singular question haunted AOL chat rooms, usenet, and game magazine mailboxes for years: Can we bring her back?</p><p dir="ltr">Games have such a strange relationship with the idea of death, so it makes sense that players in 1997--starved of narratives with any real permanent stakes beyond how many quarters you can pump in or whether you really wanted to fight all the way back to the place you died--would have a reaction to Aerith being permanently dead. It’s baked right into the narrative in fact, with Cloud, even with all of his emotional damage, grasping the enormity. “Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry, or get angry....” Cloud wrestles, in the moment she dies in his arms, with grief for the first time. And Sephiroth does not give a shit. Sephiroth is beyond human concerns. He knows what Cloud is, and flies away with his gentle amusement. Cloud is a puppet. To him, emotions for someone ultimately meaningless in the larger context of time and space are no different than a toddler weeping because it accidentally stepped on a dandelion. But this is the internal struggle that would define the next stretch of FF7. Cloud discovers what he is, and has to come to grips with what it actually means to be human, because just copying Zack Fair’s homework will only get him so far.</p><p dir="ltr">As a singular work, Final Fantasy VII’s ensemble of rebels comes to the end with proud, full hearts, accepting what must be done to save Gaia. But it doesn’t take long for fans and Square Enix to find ways to cheat death, from GameShark codes allowing players to keep Aerith in the party after she’s dead, to Square Enix futzing with their own rules to utilize Aerith in Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts. In a medium where death is always an easily solvable problem—hell, in a game series where resurrection is usually one Phoenix Down away—Aerith being dead should be a temporary inconvenience at best. She’s only mostly dead, right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416847"></a><figcaption>Aerith strikes her iconic pose in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416847-aerith1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The greatest gift, and the greatest power of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, is that there is no such respite to be had in it. From the second the game starts, Aerith’s days are numbered, with the inevitable moment when players would have to grapple with the potential of her martyr’s death acting as an oppressive weight on the entire game. The dread of Shinra, Sephiroth, and the lifestream itself, all of which could put an end to our party’s quest, adds to the pressure, forcing our party and every playable character to contend with the peril in their own way. The only one who never buckles is Aerith.</p><p dir="ltr">Aerith, from the very start of Remake, knows more than anyone about where the path leads for her and her friends. It’s never said outright, but the implication is seeded fairly often that she knows how she dies. It becomes clear how many forces conspire against them, threatening to tear the entire party of heroes asunder. And yet, in that moment, standing outside Midgar, all Aerith can do is look at the possibilities of the green, verdant world stretching in front of her, and be grateful for the company she gets to share it with. There’s something to be said for just how much of Rebirth is sidequests,new mechanics you get to use once and never again, and strange flights of fancy. And yet, unlike most open world games, that friction between the importance of the greater quest and the frivolity of the optional stuff isn’t so much a dissonant note, but the entire point.</p><p dir="ltr">As the game comes to a close, Aerith takes an unconscious Cloud through her memories of the Midgar Slums. Shinra is flying to the Temple of the Ancients, and Aerith wants you to try candy.</p><p dir="ltr">Sephiroth is waiting for his chance to murder everyone. Aerith wants you to pick out jewelry.The multiverse that is Final Fantasy VII is threatening to collapse. Aerith wants nothing more than for Cloud to look at her and hold her hand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416851"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416851-aerith2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-world-is-ending-but-heres-a-side-quest-will-rpgs-ever-solve-their-urgency-problem" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer article not long ago</a> where Robert Purchase asked a reasonable if misguided question: “Why is it that in a role-playing game where the stakes are usually 'the end of the world', the end of the world always has to wait for us to finish our sprawling to-do list first?” A reasonable question approached from the wrong angle. The question, more often than not, is why the end of the world always feels inconsequential? There’s a reason why 0% speedruns of Breath of the Wild where players rocket over to fight Calamity Ganon the second they put a shirt on never feel out of pocket: that’s a game that holds the consequences of saving the world cheap, in order for the player to create that treasured immersion developers love so much. Nintendo’s far from alone on that; this is how most open experiences are meant to operate to give players power.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII was never designed in a way where the threat of Sephiroth, Meteor, Shinra et al were meant to fade into the background. Once Sephiroth makes the fateful call, the beautiful overworld music vanishes, replaced by one of the most ominous pieces of music Nobuo Uematsu would ever compose. You literally cannot step outside without remembering what must be done, and part of why it’s effective is because we’ve seen the game willing to take someone precious away from the player to get there-- something irretrievable and irreplaceable. It’s only after the fact that players and Square tried to fill the hole of Aerith’s absence without retconning the whole thing. Rebirth, on the other hand, knows where it’s headed from minute one.Right from the beginning, it’s begging players to look at what they have, the world they inhabit, and the people who make their home here; the humanity that Sephiroth holds so cheap and the friends so dedicated to preserving it all that they’re willing to look the silver-haired, one-winged angel of death in his smug fucking face and tell him that “yes, we’re going to fight you for all this.” And by then, players will have a deep, beautiful basis of experiences in life and love to back that up.</p><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the moment.The moment in which it almost looks like Square might spare us the pain of watching Aerith--now a character so much more genuinely and beautifully written and executed than her 1997 counterpart--die in Cloud’s arms again. But no. Despite some deft swordplay, Aerith is stabbed. The materia falls down the stairs. The theme plays. And again, many will weep. As it turns out, this is, to borrow another multiverse’s parlance, a <a href="https://intothespiderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Canon_Events" rel="nofollow ">canon event</a>. Even given how much Remake and Rebirth stray from the path we all know, some things are inevitable. Aerith dies in the Temple of Ancients every time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416853"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416853-aerith3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But something’s different about Rebirth. Through Cloud’s temporary surrender to outright madness and nihilism, we’ve seen just how much of this universe is inevitable. But the magic of it is this: you are encouraged to fight it anyway. Humanity--being a thinking, feeling, emotional being--demands it. And the real difference between Rebirth and the vast majority of experiences is that everything you’ve done prior informs it.</p><p dir="ltr">This seems to be a running motif in Square’s work in the FF series of late, with XV and XVI both playing with the idea that, while ruin is inevitable every tiny interaction creates a vast tapestry of reasons to save the world anyway. Despite being faced with death time and again, Square has asked us to revel in these peoples’ lives, in all their messy glory, because it all actually matters. When death comes--and it comes heavy in all these games--it has a face. Life, on the other hand, has many. And the sacrifice of confronting the end of all things means absolutely nothing without seeing those faces first. In a truly meaningful RPG narrative, that is why the end of the world must be allowed to wait.</p><p dir="ltr">For Final Fantasy VII, we have spent literally real-world decades waiting for the opportunity to stop Aerith from going away, never truly accepting that our time with her is short. Rebirth’s great power is that it gives us more of that. We have all the time in the world to fall in love with the very act of being alive and breathing the way she does, so that when the end comes, there aren’t regrets.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith died in 1997, all Cloud could focus on was the loss--the things we can never get back, the things she will never do again.</p><p dir="ltr">When Aerith dies in 2024, Cloud swallows the sorrow, holds her hand, and tells her, "I got this." And he lets her go to fight for the world she loved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416854" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416854"></a><figcaption> </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416854-aerith4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When that fight is over, Cloud's perspective undergoes a shift; straddling timelines, able to see the void left by Aerith’s death, but carrying her with him, or at least, a multiverse echo of her. But still. Cloud knows it's not her. He can't suddenly give Aerith back to his world, and he will be uniquely equipped to share what he knows of her to get his friends through it. Our heroes mourn. But it is so much more important that Rebirth shows they are not doing it alone, and that all of them are better for having known her.</p><p>And thus, Rebirth imparts its lesson. One of the hardest but most crucial lessons of the year. We have had to let Aerith go for so long, many of us forgot why it hurt to begin with. But Rebirth lets us remember, and revel in it, and finally accept. We let her go, gladly, having fought, played, and sung with her in ways we never imagined back on PS1. There is an art to accepting the end is coming. The Remake project altogether has been, above all else, an invitation to look out at the horizon and, even knowing it has an end, to revel in what’s ahead regardless.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

Things started out well with the surprise success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, the critically acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the slick action duo of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. But things took a downward turn in the summer thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord’s</a> (failure to) launch. The doomed hero shooter and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">subsequent closing of developer Firewalk Studios</a> was certainly a low point for Sony, even if a delightful little robot did his best to brighten the mood in the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>. Since then we’ve seen the arrival of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, an even more powerful PlayStation 5 console that comes at an eye-wateringly premium price and has been met with a mixed reception. But with time ticking away, there’s barely time left in 2024 to dwell on PlayStation’s past. It already feels like time to look ahead to 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the upcoming year have in store for PlayStation? With almost all of its first-party studios keeping cards close to chests, you may be mistaken for thinking things are looking quiet. But let's delve in deeper to see exactly what games to expect for the PS5 in 2025, as well as make a few hopeful guesses of our own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Games We Know Are Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let’s look at what is scheduled to come from those all-important PlayStation Studios. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is certainly looking like the headline attraction, and it’s coming to the PS5 in 2025. The sequel to 2020’s open-world samurai adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, is set to be a stunner as we’re introduced to both a new hero and Northern Japanese location. Let’s hope for some gameplay trailers early next year or in the summer, ahead of a winter release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. It’s a multiplayer heist shooter, and so it will certainly be fascinating to see what lessons PlayStation has learned from the live-service disaster of Concord. First revealed in 2023, we’re yet to see any gameplay, but hopefully that doesn’t mean it won’t hit its target of a 2025 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And… those are the only PlayStation Studios games we currently know are slated for a 2025 release. And with no actual release dates locked in yet, we can barely plot out what to expect in each part of the year. But that isn’t to say there won’t be more big games coming to the PS5 next year, though, and we can certainly theorise at what else we might see from some of Sony’s first-party stable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Naughty Dog’s next adventure will take us to the stars in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. We don’t expect to be playing this in 2025, though, but we’ll happily eat up any more info Neil Druckmann and the team wants to share about it – especially if that includes some of that laser blade gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has a lot of weight resting on its shoulders, not only because it will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">Bungie’s first full release since it was acquired by Sony</a>, but alongside Fairgames, it will be PlayStation’s first big new live-service shooter to follow in the quickly fading footsteps of Concord. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> developers have as strong a shooter pedigree as anyone in the business, so it will certainly be interesting to see the result of its work as it aims to revive its long-dormant 90s series as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could 2025 be the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> emerges from its oily cocoon? Hideo Kojima was at The Game Awards but didn’t bring a new trailer with him. Unacceptable behaviour, if you ask me. Are we any closer to knowing what it’s all about? Who’s to say, but we certainly want to play it. And the sooner we can, the sooner Kojima can move on to working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive from the Metal Gear master.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to – especially if you’re into big swords. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> looks set to be a flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game. A semi-open world samurai bloodfest with soulslike elements, it certainly doesn’t look to be lacking in style. No release date has been given as yet, but let's hope for next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of blades, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/where-winds-meet">Where Winds Meet</a> is a PS5 console-exclusive RPG set in ancient China. Taking place during the Ten Kingdoms Era, you step into the shoes of a warrior who wields influence over warring dynasties, shaping history with the point of your sword, as well as mystical and magical abilities. Originally set for a 2024 release before being delayed to add even more content to its packed, mammoth open world, it wouldn’t be a shock to see it finally arrive within the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there are more swords and even bigger blades in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ballad-of-antara">Ballad of Antara</a>, a free-to-play co-op action RPG packed with multiple protagonists and intertwining stories coming to the PS5 in 2025. We’ll get a better look at it soon, with a beta promised to be on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Think we’re done with swords? Think again. This next game even has one in the title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword of the Sea</a>. You don’t use this one to fight with, though; instead, you’ll be plonking your feet on it and riding around at speed, Tony Hawk and Metaphor: ReFantazio style. From Abzû and The Pathless studio Giant Squid, the reveal trailer couldn’t help but remind us of Journey, as a mysterious cloaked character hoverswords around vast desert ruins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another relatively fresh announcement, having only been revealed at September’s State of Play, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> is the next game from Lost in Random developer Moonhood Studios. An adventure handcrafted from clay, it’s set to be one of the most visually striking games of 2025. Plus, it’s even coming out on PS VR2. At least someone is helping out that long-forgotten little guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last PS5 console exclusive we’re going to highlight is a game we wrote about exactly this time last year in our 2024 PlayStation look-ahead. Hopefully 2025 will be the year we finally get to clumsily bumble our way through the world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. A PS5 console-exclusive, the team up from the developers behind Getting Over It and Ape Out looks equal parts agonising as it does hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be it for exclusives, but there are plenty more multiplatform games coming out in 2025 that are set to make it a bumper year for PlayStation players. Alongside the arrival of I<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">ndiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> onto PS5, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> to name but a few. Oh, and a little game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Could be good. Who knows.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hopes and Dreams</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the fun part: the section where we get to cross our fingers and conjure up games that don’t exist yet, but maybe will appear before our eyes in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has had a relatively quiet year – for a studio that puts out new releases with such regularity, that is – but understandable considering it continues to recover from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">data breach suffered at the end of 2023</a>. We know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> is in the works but don’t yet know exactly when it will be in our hands. And, if rumours are to be believed, a Venom game is scheduled to arrive before it. While it may be unlikely that we’ll be playing either of these superhero stories within the next 12 months, we might get a clearer picture of what is coming next from the Spidey studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Santa Monica Studio. What’s next for the God of War developer is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – moved on to helm a new project in 2021 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat</a>. Could we see what Barlog’s game is in 2025?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other studios, can we expect yet more delves into the world of Horizon from Guerrilla Games, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">an online multiplayer game reportedly in development</a> at the Amsterdam developers? And it's been a long time since Bend released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> – almost six whole years, in fact – and the studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">hinted that it's making another open-world adventure</a>. Little is known apart from that, but it’s safe to say we’d like to learn more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, we know very little about what is in the pipeline from many of Sony’s first-party studios, so don’t be surprised if the PS5 is in for another relatively quiet year in 2025. We’d be more than happy to be wrong about that, though, and be pleasantly surprised by a flurry of reveals and releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, could <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now">Sony’s interest in acquiring the massive Kadokawa company</a> (which, alongside a huge anime portfolio, also owns FromSoftware) finally result in a Bloodborne remaster or sequel? I know we said these are hopes and dreams… but don’t be silly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of hardware, Sony has been very busy over the past couple of years with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vr2">PS VR2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all released to varying levels of success. As a result, we expect things to be quieter on the hardware front when it comes to 2025. However, it may be the year that we see the PS5 Pro justify itself further as an expensive upgrade if games like Ghost of Yotei and GTA 6 start to push the base PlayStation 5 to its limit. It will certainly be interesting to see how developers embrace this new tech over the next year or so, and if we start to see genuinely impressive comparisons between the original PS5 and Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while we expect actual hardware releases to be quiet, we’ve heard whispers that there may be some news to share of fresh PlayStation tech in 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-set-to-take-on-nintendo-with-new-portable-playstation-report">Could we see Sony take another stab at the handheld market?</a> Just stick some internal storage into the Portal. I have no qualifications when it comes to hardware engineering, but how hard can it be, lads? In all seriousness, though, if recent reports are to be believed, then maybe we could actually see a successor to the PSP and PS Vita in the coming year, or at least an announcement of one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be honest, it’s all guesswork isn’t it? Got your own theories and hopes for what we’ll see from PlayStation in 2025? Let us know in the comments below, as well as what you’re most excited to play.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
