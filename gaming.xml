            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">Horror</a> is escaping a melted flesh abomination, but to pull off true terror, you need to have a gleefully murderous human get right up in my face and grin about whatever nasty human stuff they're planning to get up to. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/agni-village-of-calamity">Agni: Village Of Calamity</a>, an Indonesian survival horror that looks interesting for its early Resident Evil influences, but has gotten stuck in my head for specifically evoking Resident Evil 7's intimate human threat. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It's that claustrophobic camera work that's drawn me in. I have to admit I've become so spoiled by indie survival horror of late that I've grown slightly numb to the sort of things that used to excite me. Fixed camera angles. Limited inventory space. I blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a> for being so excellent. But Agni feels deliberate, rather than overly reverent to its influences.</p>
<p>Agni is your character. She's an Indonesian cop who's gone rogue to explore a remote village. Not a remote village, Agni! That's where the bad things happen. I'm especially fond of how the setting allows for more lush and distinct greenery than you might expect from this genre. Not enough vibrant fronds in survival horror, as a rule.</p>
<p>"Throughout the journey, Agni grapples with guilt, fear of abandonment, and unresolved trauma from her past," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151360/Agni_Village_of_Calamity/">Steam</a>, leaning into Silent Hill-isms. "Her perilous journey tests her resolve as she confronts her inner demons while striving to find out what happened and find her missing partner".</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/DYPsXgQHsGk">13 minute gameplay video</a> available besides the trailer. Agni explores an abandoned house with her trusty lighter, strolls past some mannequins (pointing out the tired trope herself, which doesn't absolve you, game), and eventually has to run as they come to life. Again, it's the focus on Agni's own reactions during cinematics that I feel is the strongest part here, lending everything an off-kilter indie cinema slant I'm very drawn to.</p>
<p>Things get progressively strange, but I'll leave that for you to discover on your own. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-a-minecraft-movie-getting-a-sequel-will-there-be-a-minecraft-2-movie-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Barely two weeks after A Minecraft Movie was released, a sequel was demanded by the rabid fanbase. It honors the franchise and brings Minecraft to life in ways never thought possible, and if a sequel does happen, you’d have to think it would be as big a smash hit.</p>



<p>Jack Black, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jason-momoa-promotes-minecraft-movie-by-saying-he-doesnt-let-his-kids-play-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, and co. had the difficult task of bringing to life one of the most successful franchises of all time. Minecraft has earned billions from game sales, merchandise, and much more. But A Minecraft Movie is a different beast. It hasn’t disappointed moviegoers who helped the movie earn over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its first weekend</a>.</p>



<p>Its success has grown daily, fueling speculation of a successor. We’ve got the latest on a new movie, and whether this is becoming a fully fledged film franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-status-explained">Will There Be A Minecraft Movie 2? Sequel Status Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, buddy. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to an interview, plans for A Minecraft Movie sequel are “imminent.”</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/warner-bros-mike-de-luca-pam-abdy-courage-in-face-of-brutal-press-coverage-1236366618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> interviewed Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy from Warner Bros. about the future of A Minecraft Movie and the potential for a sequel. When queried about the plans for a Minecraft sequel, De Luca had this to say: <strong>“Imminently. The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.”</strong></p>



<p>This comes days after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film’s director, Jared Hess, said</a>: “He would have a blast doing the sequel.” He said there were many ideas and concepts they couldn’t fit into this film, so it makes for a sequel to follow and to include a lot more of the source material that didn’t make the cut the first time around.</p>



<p>An imminent sequel is hardly a surprise given the overwhelming success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-be-about">What Could A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel be About?</h2>



<p><strong>There are still many new characters, enemies, and ideas that could be introduced in A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel, but the end of the original film gives away some big details.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Alert—I’m about to briefly discuss what happens after the credits roll in A Minecraft Movie. You have been warned.</strong></p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits cutscene to prolong its runtime</a>. In it, Steve turns up at a house with the hope of going into the attic. We find out the house belongs to a person named Alex—who Minecraft fans will instantly recognize.</p>



<p>We don’t know if this is a mini one-off for Alex or if they could feature heavily in a sequel. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

<p>We hope you’re enjoying A Minecraft Movie, and listening to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclaimer about not throwing popcorn</a>.

            <p>Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure? Having been announced in 2017, the game finally released in February of last year after numerous delays and setbacks. However, Skull and Bones failed to make positive waves on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">players calling out the underwhelming gameplay and poorly designed end game</a>, among other gripes.</p>
<p>Since its release, Skull and Bones has pretty much fallen off the radar, to be honest. At the time of writing, the game currently boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/">221 players on Steam</a>, and while that is obviously not a complete overview (the game released on other platforms, as well) it still isn't an especially auspicious number .</p>
<p>But despite all this, Ubisoft is still updating Skull and Bones (perhaps tinkering away with the engine and such while it gets ready for the yet-to-be-announced, but much desired and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">heavily rumoured piratical remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a>).</p>

<p>Last night, Skull and Bones' team released patch notes for the first season of the game's second year, known as Ascent into Chaos. This new season kicks off today, 15th April, and includes things like a new ship (a Schooner), a new status effect (Shell-Shocked), new upgrade tree and a new pet in the form of a tiger cub.</p>
<p>Item Ascension will also arrive this season, with the accompanying lore blurb reading:</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean is set ablaze by the war between the Megacorporations, with each side looking to gain an advantage over the other by using increasingly powerful weapons. The origins of these ascended weapons remain a mystery, but what is known is that acquiring them may be vital to surviving the coming onslaught."</p>
<p>You will need to have made your way up to Infamy Tier 9 at a minimum to be able to make use of Item Ascension. When you reach this, though, you can expect to recieve some mail which will enable you to begin the Ascension and Modification quest. Once you do that, you will then need to pop over to  the Blacksmith to unlock the Item Ascension feature.</p>
<p>There are three modification grades, Ubisoft explains. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic - General improvements</li>
<li>Advanced - Noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>Special - Powerful improvements with unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Modification Slots, meanwhile, are assigned based on the weapon rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common - 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Uncommon - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Rare - 2 Basic, 1 Special</li>
<li>Epic - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find full details in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/19T7NArKvzO1MofftUXPDi">Ubisoft's Skull and Bones blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In an accompanying Skull and Bones: Year 2 Showcase video, senior community developer Alexis Cretton thanked the game's community, adding Ubisoft was "committed to support Skull and Bones for years ahead".</p>
<p>You can check out the full showcase below.</p>

<p>On its release last year, our Matt complimented Skull and Bones' "beautiful world" and "bombastic ship-to-ship combat". However, he was less enamoured with the game's boring busywork and tedious traversal.</p>
<p>As he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">wrote in Eurogamer's two star Skull and Bones review</a>: "No game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While The Last of Us Part II Remastered doesn't really need ray tracing to look good, features like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion would really bring the game's visuals to the next level, judging from a new video shared online a few hours ago.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by Beyond Dreams, shows the recently released PC version of the game running with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ray tracing mod</a> powered by the Complete RT shader, the most advanced ray tracing shader available to date, and a custom Reshade preset that introduces improved global illumination, ambient occlusion, color grading, dynamic depth of field, and other enhancements. As highlighted at the beginning of the 8K resolution video below, the differences are massive and significantly enhance the game's visuals in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] The Last of Us 2 Remastered: RAY TRACING Mod | Complete RT | RTX 5090 | Relaxing Walking &amp; Ride" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZgjAvsP_UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched on PC earlier this month, featuring the same content seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">PlayStation 5 release</a> as well as some additional features like new characters and maps for the No Return roguelike mode, which have also been added to the PlayStation 5 release following the game's PC launch, and support for PC-specific features like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1164477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new claim, most GameStop stores expect to have abundant Nintendo Switch 2 console units at launch.</p>



<p>The new claim comes from Nintendeal on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911810754099249648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-nsw2-united-states-preorder-stock-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), stating that according to their sources, most GameStop stores are expecting “100 Switch 2 consoles available at launch.” However, games and accessories will be “extremely limited.” Players have questioned whether 100 units are an ample amount to meet the demand, to which the source <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811154672029943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, “100 consoles at launch in each store is…. a lot more than basically any console launch ever.”</p>



<p>Along with Nintendo Switch 2 units at GameStop, players wondered if Best Buy would have a similar amount of stock. Nintendeal <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811597091377666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> that they have not heard anything from Best Buy sources; however, “the general consensus is that the console itself will not be difficult to acquire.”</p>



<p>Ever since it was announced, players have wondered about the supply of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. Nintendo also recently delayed pre-orders in the US “to assess the potential impact” of the tariffs. However, if the source is accurate, it seems the company will be well prepared for the console’s launch. Nintendo will use a pre-order invite system on My Nintendo Store for the Switch 2, and the invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. </p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Switch 2s manufactured in China could be subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US Import Tariffs</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>. What are your thoughts on most GameStop stores having 100 Switch 2 consoles at launch?

            <p>Video games can be an expensive hobby, but how much money have you actually spent? Steam has you covered.</p>
<p>Buried away in the help section of Valve's PC game platform is a page called External Funds Used, which provides a total of all your expenditure.</p>
<p>It's not a new page, but it is hard to find and certainly proves interesting once you know it exists. Users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1jycup7/comment/mmxdv4f/">reddit</a> recently explained how to find it (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/steam-total-account-spend/">PC Gamer</a>), though whether you want to is up to your discretion.</p>
<p>If you're intrigued, head over to: help &gt; steam support &gt; my account &gt; data related to your steam account &gt; external funds used.</p>
<p>Funds are listed under different categories, though TotalSpend is the big one. OldSpend is for funds applied before April 2015, PWSpend is for players whose accounts are linked to Perfect World for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and ChinaSpend is funds applied from China.</p>
<p>Steam hosts regular sales, but even with big discounts they're likely responsible for a high proportion of sales when they come around.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-every-single-steam-sale-event-planned-for-2025">Valve confirmed all the Steam sales planned for 2025</a>. Next up will be the Sokoban Fest from 21st - 28th April, followed by Wargames Fest from 28th April - 5th May.</p>
<p>The biggest, though, will be the Steam Summer Sale, running from 26th June - 10th July.</p>
<p>In other Steam data news, Valve released its Steam Hardware and Software Survey in March, which revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/50-of-all-steam-users-in-february-were-chinese-speaking">Chinese-speaking users now account for half of the entire userbase</a>.</p>
<p>The platform also has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">new feature that warns users of potentially abandoned early access games</a>.</p>
<p>Have you checked your total spend? Were you surprised?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is estimated to be more powerful than the Xbox Series S but less powerful than the base PlayStation 5, and won't be able to run PS5 games as well as the original system does due to lower memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>Following up on some <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/">earlier comments</a> regarding the portable edition of the next-generation Sony console, known leaker Kepler L2 provided some additional information on the system on the NeoGAF forums. Asked about the system's power, the insider confirmed that, while it won't be as powerful as the base current-generation system, it will definitely be able to<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> run PS5 games</a>, although not at the same resolution and framerate, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth. Judging from this information, the leaker's assessment of the system's power, which will sit between the Xbox Series S and the base PlayStation 5, sounds accurate enough, although they <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> how it's difficult to estimate the system's performance due to it using an unreleased GPU architecture.</p>
<p>Speaking further about the portable PlayStation 6 SoC, the leaker confirmed it will be a different chip than the one powering the home console, designed to run at very low voltages, and that will feature <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270322851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot less than 40 compute units</a>, so likely less than the 36 featured by the base PlayStation 5's chip, although this doesn't tell us much without any additional information. This SoC will also tape out <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270323166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few months after the regular PlayStation 6 SoC</a>, so it may take a while longer for more information to come out.</p>
<p>While any edition of the PlayStation 6 has yet to be announced, we know that it will be powered by AMD like its two immediate predecessors. This wasn't a given, however, as Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">reportedly</a> bid to produce the system but ultimately lost to AMD. The system is expected to be released between 2027 and 2028.</p>

<p>The PS6 Portable claims have been updated with more information, clarifying that the handheld will be able to run PS5 games with a scaled-down experience. </p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-can-run-ps5-games-at-a-lower-resolution-and-frame-rate">PS6 Portable Can Run PS5 Games At a Lower Resolution and Frame Rate</h2>



<p>Yesterday, information about a next-gen PlayStation 6 (PS6) Portable surfaced online, with KeplerL2 claiming that the portable version of the upcoming console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be as powerful</a> as the PS5 and the handheld features “a 15w SoC on 3nm.” Today, the user has clarified on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGaf</a> (via r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jzjjef/kepler_clarifies_that_the_portable_ps6_can/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>) that the PS6 Portable “can definitely run PS5 games, just not at the same resolution/FPS, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-probably-falls-between-xbox-series-s-and-ps5">PS6 Portable Probably Falls Between Xbox Series S and PS5</h2>



<p>KeplerL2 has also provided context about where the PS6 Portable would stand against the current-gen consoles. The leaker thinks that in terms of performance, “it’s somewhere between the XSS (Xbox Series S) and PS5.” However, they clarified that it’s hard to know for sure as it’s “using an unreleased GPU uarch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>KeplerL2 also spoke about the regular PS6 SoC, explaining that it differs from the portable SoC and “[Redacted] is specially designed to run at very low voltages”. KeplerL2 added that the portable PS6 chip has “a lot less than 40” CUs (compute units).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from official Sony channels, so take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing the price</a> of the PS5 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

			<p>The long-rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is going to be shadowdropped in a few days, according to a very reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on yesterday's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb</a>'s GameBreaking News, reliable insider Jeff Grubb, who correctly provided information before official announcements multiple times in the past, provided an update on the rumored remake of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, saying that it will be shadowdropped next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Prices Increasing in Some Regions | GameBreaking News 04/14/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_ONk_GmF-Q?start=2238&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that the Oblivion remake&nbsp;<span>will be released towards the end of April. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, another reliable insider, NateTheHate, suggested that the game would be released close to April 21st, so at this point, there's a very high chance one of the worst-kept</span>&nbsp;gaming secrets of the year will indeed be released in a week or so.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake, or rather remaster as it was called at the time, was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">2023</a> during an FTC investigational hearing with Xbox head Phil Spencer. The game, however, was never acknowledged in any official capacity, and its scope has likely changed since its unofficial reveal, as it is said it will be a full-blown remake powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which will also include some gameplay changes besides improved visuals. Thankfully, it seems like it won't be long until we finally learn how the classic RPG will have been changed for its new release.</p>

            <p>The developers of post-apocalyptic shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl</a> have shared a roadmap for future updates, promising new guns, smarter foes, and a helpful development kit for modders. Among the changes is good news for anyone frustrated after pumping their entire backpack of bullets into 30 to 50 feral hogs. Murderised mutants will now drop loot of some kind, instead of offering no reward at all.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>We're not told what kind of loot they'll drop, but in the developer's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/572627883580720125">roadmap post on Steam</a> there's a little picture of a tooth scribbled next to the note "mutant loot". So probably lots of handy gizzards and guts. Currently, when you kill a mutant, their corpses are simply empty. This is unlike defeated human foes who can be ransacked for bullets, food, and boots. This means that a series of mutant encounters can quickly drain your ammunition stocks. Especially when it comes to the spongier beasts. And getting nothing back after firing all that precious ammo into hides can feel frustrating to some.</p>
<p>Like I say, it's not the only upcoming change. The developers listed their other priorities for the next three months in the post. Smarter enemy and ally AI are high on the list, with "better cover/flanking use" and "limited grenades". Mutants will soon eat fallen victims if all goes to plan, and will "react to threats". There will also be two new weapons, we're told, alongside widescreen support and "further stabilization".  </p>

 </a>
<figcaption>I got nothing for killing this? What a boar. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/GSC Game World</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another item on the list is a beta for a planned "ModKit". While there are already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-bulletsponge-mutants-can-be-nerfed-with-this-handy-mod-saving-you-precious-rounds">plenty of handy mods</a> for Stalker 2 (including one that already adds <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389">mutant loot</a>), this SDK will come packaged with a guide and might make modders' lives a little easier. The devs are also planning to set up Steam Workshop support, so players can add mods easily from there. </p>
<p>These plans might change, say GSC Game World in a flavoury disclaimer scribbled at the bottom of the stained note: "Mission targets may be moved from Q2 to later dates in case of Zone instability." </p>
<p>Stalker 2 launched in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-is-out-now-and-buggy-as-hell-but-the-developers-are-already-planning-fixes">very buggy state</a> but was well-received despite the jank. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a> James called it "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off". Soon after the radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> came out, the developers admitted that some important features, such as the "A-life" simulation of patrolling squads, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">simply broken</a>. But they've been routinely and reliably patching things since then, with the latest significant batch of fixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-latest-patch-once-again-comes-with-four-figures-worth-of-fixes-and-improvements">landing last month</a>. </p>
<p>James also once became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beastmaster-of-stalker-2-part-one-how-to-make-friends-and-eviscerate-people">a beastmaster with lots of mutant minions</a> in the game. I wonder how he feels now his "friends" will soon become skinnable loot rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a long time coming, but A Minecraft Movie has finally creeped up on 2025 and delivered the goods. It’s raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, and if you’re looking to see it yourself, we can tell you how long it is and if you need to stick around for a post-credits scene.</p>



<p>Video game movies and TV are as popular as they’ve ever been. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> has captivated TV audiences, whereas animated blockbusters like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario. Bros Movie</a> has lit up the silver screen. It’s the turn of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>, and the big-screen adaptation of the block-building bonanza.</p>



<p>Depending on what you read and who you trust, Minecraft is the <strong>first or second-best-selling game in history</strong>—putting a lot of pressure on the movie’s shoulders. It’s doing well, and despite people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing popcorn at every screening</a>, it bodes well for a sequel. Here are the crucial details if you need to see A Minecraft Movie first.</p>

<p><strong>A Minecraft Movie has an official runtime of 101 minutes.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve ever been to the theater yourself, you know you won’t be in your seat for 101 minutes. This means the official runtime of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-minecraft-movie-out-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a> from the opening stills to the final frame of the credits is approximately 101 minutes (or 6,060 seconds).</p>



<p>However, factor in eating your popcorn before the film starts, a few minutes waiting for the lights to go down, sitting through adverts and a few helpings of new movie trailers, and the overall experience is probably closer to <strong>120 minutes / 2 hours</strong> or a bit longer.</p>



<p>Let’s see if a post-credits scene accounts for the movie’s minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-a-minecraft-movie-have-a-post-credits-cutscene-no-spoilers">Does A Minecraft Movie Have a Post-Credits Cutscene? (No spoilers)</h2>



<p><strong>There is a post-credits scene in A Minecraft Movie, meaning you should stick around until the very end.</strong></p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to disclose the nature of the scene. It’s a nice bit of fan service for Minecraft lovers. But I will say the scene lasts <strong>roughly 25 seconds</strong>, so you don’t need to hang around for too long once it begins.</p>



<p>It could have potential implications for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored sequel</a>, so I’d say it’s worth watching. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to give everyone involved in the production the credit they deserve!</p>

			<p>Evolution comes slowly in nature, but in technology it can often come all at once.&nbsp;Since Atari proliferated the joystick, and Nintendo got the D-Pad right on the first go, we’ve got used to the status quo of how we interact with our games over the past fifty years. Now though, Victrix are bringing evolution to the arcade stick, by… getting rid of the stick.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro KO™ Leverless Fight Stick by Turtle Beach®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ld7W4CUzCsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to rewrite your brain? That’s what using the Victrix Pro KO Leverless feels like if you’re coming to it after years of using a regular arcade stick. Like the deeply unusual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/22/azeron-cyborg-gaming-keypad-review/">Azeron Cyborg</a>, Victrix are rewriting how we interact with games. Leverless sticks have been around for a while, but this is their first true foray into the mainstream thanks to Victrix’s newfound role as one of Turtle Beach’s subsidiaries.</p>


<p>The Pro KO Leverless Fight Stick has an RRP of £229.99 and comes in one colour scheme: black. While our review unit was an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC compatible edition, there’s also a PS5/PS4/PC-flavoured one as well. In the box is the unit itself, a 3-metre braided cable in Victrix’s trademark purple, a fabric carry bag with the Victrix logo, and a breakaway USB-C adaptor to prevent any unwanted mishaps when someone trips over your cable.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising things when you first take the Pro KO Leverless out of the box is just how slim it is. With a super slim profile, it’s vastly thinner than Victrix’s headline Pro Arcade line or indeed any other major fight stick on the market. Despite its size, there’s still a decent heft to it, which you can probably attribute to the anodised aluminium body.</p>


<p>The underside is wholly covered by a chunky rubber grip plate, once again in vibrant Victrix purple, and there’s then a series of release catches so you can pop the top plate off to reveal the inner workings of the stick. It’s worth noting that the underside is more or less completely flat, and there’s no raised or lowered areas to reduce the grippy surface making contact with the table. The Pro KO Leverless certainly isn’t going anywhere once you put it on a table, and without the added leverage of an actual stick, it stays put on your lap too.</p>
<p>Underneath the metal case is an exciting builder’s kit of stick parts, and it’s refreshingly easy to customise the Pro KO Leverless when you compare it to other sticks. There’s a set of tongs to pull the buttons, switches, and their surrounds out from the housing, as well as four additional switch internals and the requisite button units.</p>
<p>There’s four circular cover plates, so you can block off up to four of the button spaces, or you can run with anything up to a full complement of 16 inputs. Because of those cover plates and the spare buttons included, you can design your own personal layout and then easily implement it. Don’t like it? Simply try something else. It takes moments to unhook the front cover and a couple of seconds to pull each of the buttons out. It’s satisfying and slick and makes the Pro KO Leverless incredibly easy to live with. There’s no wiring, no soldering, and no worrying with the Pro KO.</p>

<p>The other neat little feature is a locking mechanism for the cable connection. A spring-loaded door opens on the rear of the stick and then cradles the cable once you’ve inserted it. With this setup, you won’t have to worry about it coming loose mid-tournament and suffering the indignation of defeat when Ken simply stops moving.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you’re at home you can add the breakaway attachment so if someone trips over the cable, it won’t rip your £230 fight stick out of your lap. Everywhere you look, the Pro KO Leverless shows signs of intelligent design and thoughtful implementation, and it makes for a great user experience.</p>
<p>At first, interacting with the Pro KO Leverless is more akin to typing on a laptop than using a fight stick. Your left hand utilises the four directional inputs, while your right rests over the eight traditional input buttons. The Cherry MX Speed Silver buttons feel fantastic beneath your fingers, with a good range of travel and you get a reassuringly solid response from each activation.</p>
<p>The top row of buttons gives you access to the traditional Xbox Home, Menu, Options, and Share inputs, while adding in additional access such as muting chat from a headset connected via the 3.5mm socket or altering the RGB lighting. There’s also the tournament-required toggle to lock all of these buttons off, so you don’t pause your opponent to death.</p>

<p>Each of the button surrounds can light up in a variety of hues thanks to the inclusion of RGB. We can all agree that this makes any gaming device better, and here you can choose between a host of colours and different effects directly on the stick, including one of the ugliest setups I’ve ever seen where the buttons are all different colours. I opted for solid purple, because, well, it’s a Victrix stick, and because it looks cool.<br>
If you want to go even deeper, there’s the Victrix Control Hub app, which lets you dig into the lighting even further, as well as update your stick’s firmware and more.</p>
<p>I think I’m a leverless convert. My traditional arcade stick skills have never fully eclipsed my ability with a controller, despite years of trying, and the Pro KO Leverless feels far more intuitive than I could have ever expected. After adjusting to the different way of interacting with my games, I think my reaction times are vastly improved, and aside from that, I haven’t experienced the same level of fatigue from long sessions as I did with a traditional stick.</p>
<p>The Pro KO Leverless won’t be for everybody, and if you’re looking for one of the absolute best fight sticks on the market, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’s Pro Arcade fight stick</a> is a delight to own. There is also a leverless version if you want the top-end leverless experience, but it’s a further £100, and far bigger and bulkier than the Pro KO. Alternatively, the Razer Kitsune is Razer’s entry in the leverless category, and can be found on sale for around the same price as the Pro KO. However, you lose the button customisation of the Pro KO, which feels essential. You do gain Chroma RGB around the edges though, and you can buy official vinyl skins as well.</p>

            <p>I'm thankfully very remote from the capital these days, but Edwin will occasionally regale the morning meeting with dark fables about how much a pint now costs in London. He'll stumble on to camera, his eyes bloodshot and breathing heavy, and we'll all know he's traded a new vital organ for a swift half. Occasionally he'll dart his head around to the sound of banging at the door then immediately dive out of the window, and we'll pray for his safe return after outrunning The Bad Teapot gang, who he borrowed £8000 from in 2006 for a warm plastic beaker of Carling with a dead wasp floating in it. Sounds bleak down there.</p>
<p>As such, I would not blame anyone south of the Severn-Wash for resorting to the stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle </a>drink stealing antics we find in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sipssassin">Sipssassin</a>. You play a bald, sharply dressed sneak thief. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never pay for another drink as long as you live. There are some nonsense lore reasons about why it's actually good and cool that you're half-inching everyone's tipples but that just makes it less fun, honestly. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Many classic stealth tricks are available to you. Disguising yourself as a security guard. Hiding in a cardboard box. Burying yourself in a ridiculously-placed hay bale. Putting a moose head over your victim's eyes so they can't see you pinch their margarita. As with classic Hitman, there are also a selection of mundane objects to bonk people with, stunning them so you can make a getaway. You're not confined to just Agent 47's disappointing son, either. You'll also unlock other characters, one of which is Agent 47's much less disappointing son, a horrible goose.</p>
<p>There are four game modes in all. 'Sipstraction' tasks you simply with stealing six drinks then scoring you on how many times you were discovered. In 'Happy Hour' you'll need to combo guzzle as many ill-gotten bevvies as possible in a two minute time limit. 'Drinkvesitage' involves a "special tracking activity", and there's also an exploration free roam mode, where you'll take on side quests and meet characters. I'll let good mate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820190/Sipssassin/">Steam</a> describe the features. That's just good business sense, that.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>25 playable characters to unlock</li>
<li>5 unique missions with hidden secrets</li>
<li>4 distinct game modes to prove your Sipssassin abilities</li>
<li>Over 60 different drinks to drink</li>
<li>Lots of NPCs to steal drinks from</li>
<li>6 Legendary Drinks that grant special power up abilities</li>
<li>6 Special Gadgets that help you be a sneaky little guy</li>
<li>50 collectible shards to find and rebuild the Chalice of Destiny</li>
<li>Disguises to gain access to restricted areas</li>
<li>Wacky characters to meet and talk to</li>
<li>An alternate dimension video game conference called "Yeet3"</li>
<li>A super long straw so you can drink your neighbor's milkshake</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sipsassin is due out on May 2nd, 2025. No price details, yet. Slightly more than a wasp pint, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>15 years on from the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a>, I still think with fondness and yearning of the Uboinik automatic shotgun. It’s a six chamber cylindrical affair with mouthwatering red shells that dangle before your trigger finger like pert, juicy plums. This is just to say / I have shot / the shells / that were in / the shotgun / and which / you were probably / saving / for the mutant round the corner. / Forgive me / they were murderous / so sockety / and so round. Ahem.</p>
<p>Reloading the shotgun is an intricate process of 1) sliding four shells into the available chambers while tossing the weapon jauntily from hand to hand, and then 2) cocking it again to expose and fill the remaining two chambers. You can also chamber a single shell and cock the weapon, if you don’t have time for a full reload, which means when you load another four shells and fire them, there’ll be an empty chamber to reckon with midway through the next burst. That empty chamber has gotten me killed a dozen times, I think.</p><!--more-->

<p>Somebody poured love into that reloading animation. Love and a certain spitefulness. This is Metro 2033, 4A Games’s spiritual successor to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which takes place in the Moscow underground after the nukes. Ammo is also currency here, and the dingy rails teem with bandits and mutants. There is no time to get poetic about shotguns. Today, 15th April, you can experience all that love and spitefulness for free. The Redux edition is 100% off on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a> till tomorrow to mark the game’s 15th birthday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-metro-2033">the RPS review of the original Metro 2033</a>, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) was wooed but not wowed, calling attention to “a jarring disconnect between the excellence of its appearance and the adequacy of its action. 

"It’s a good enough shooter, but it looks like it should be a phenomenal one,” he went on. “In a perfect world, there’ll be a mod that fiddles with the balance, maybe ups the human count and lowers the mutant count, and definitely leaves a few more gas masks lying around.” </p>
<p>The 2014-released Redux version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metro-redux-review">adds a bunch of modes and graphics features</a>: as Christopher Livingston summarised, “if you enjoyed Metro 2033, I strongly suspect you'll like it even more on the new engine, especially since the options for a grueling, hardcore experience are still there despite the revamped stealth and improved AI making things a little easier for you.”</p>
<p>The typical question to ask of any 4A Games news piece is: which 4A Games, exactly? The studio began life in Ukraine in 2006, but in 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta. While they've collaborated on Metro for years, the two studios are now totally separate: 4A Games in Ukraine have rebranded as Reburn, and are now developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, while Metro remains in the hands of the Malta studio, who are still owned by Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A shining beacon of indie ingenuity that proves the only thing you need to achieve global stardom as a lone developer is a singular vision and the willpower to execute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be a colossal misconception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher Playstack, communications director Wout van Halderen explains that when the company first tweeted about signing the project two years ago the post received a mere smattering of likes. In short: nobody cared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says the company still jokes internally about the narrative that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> essentially materialized out of thin air when the publisher spent months carefully constructing a "Wheel of Attention" to give the project the&nbsp;best chance of success.

When that didn't work, a voiceover was added that still didn't quite hit the mark. Next they dialed in on the jokers themselves. Even then, there was something amiss and visuals alone couldn't showcase the buzz of piecing together that perfect run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playstack realized it had to fail fast and pivot. "I think the next best thing to playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is watching someone else playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and seeing the genuine reactions that they're having to the gameplay," says van Halderen. "You see the enthusiasm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher placed streamers in its sights, but rather than blindly pitching to the biggest names in the biz, chose to start small and expand methodically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack was "super specific" in its initial approach. He saw overlap with other popular deck-building and "highly-mechanical" titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay The Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Auto Pets</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

So we're both happy," continues van Halderen, who notes that data generation is also vital when courting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If people are hungry for more information [...] we can answer questions like 'how long are people playing?

            <p>
A Minecraft Movie has now amassed more than $550m (£415m) globally since its launch less than two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-minecraft-movie-500-million-the-amateur-china-global-international-box-office-1236367389/">Deadline</a> reports that $270m (£204m) of the film's haul comes from overseas, with the UK its biggest market outside of the US, followed by China, Germany, Mexico and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The viral success of the film has caused it to overperform expectations despite limp critical reviews. In short: kids love it, and have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">loved going to throw popcorn in the air during its meme-tastic Chicken Jockey scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Minecraft is proving popular, there's still some way for it to go to beat The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which wound up earning $1.3bn (£982m) during the same spring release window back in 2023, setting the record for the highest-grossing film based on a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Can Minecraft beat Nintendo's mascot? Possibly - it seems like Minecraft still has plenty of life left in it yet, even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the film does now include a warning message asking audiences to behave</a>, in an attempt to curb feral behaviour (and possibly because Warner Bros doesn't want a lawsuit involving animal cruelty after someone brought a live chicken to a showing).
</p>
<p>
Regardless of where A Minecraft Movie ultimately ends up, it's happy days for Warner Bros, which is reportedly already in talks over a potential sequel. And, as is the norm for movies hoping to become franchises these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">A Minecraft Movie naturally ends with a teaser for what could come next</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former developer who worked on the cancelled PlayStation console exclusive Concord has called out online commenters comparing it with Bungie's recently showcased Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie revealed more about its next shooter at the weekend</a> including its release date: 23rd September. Yet the lack of marketing and mixed response to its visual style has sparked comparisons with Concord, and claims that Marathon will be Sony's next flop.</p>
<p>The anonymous developer and artist took to reddit to respond to the comments, asking players to not "punish others for our mistakes".</p>

<p>"Many players know about Concord, and what happened with that project. Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear," the developer admitted.</p>
<p>"It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe. I am not asking for pity, or even sympathy because, after all this is the name of the game, you win or lose. The margin for success is very thin. I took a chance, and lost.</p>
<p>"Some of you probably smell blood in the water, and probably want to roast me for no longer lurking, and exposing myself. I hope you don't, and see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing. Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream, gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon.</p>
<p>"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed."</p>
<p>The developer concluded: "I worked on Concord, and did my best. We came up short, please don't punish others for our mistakes. We are all human beings who are trying to create something special, and Marathon is no different. Be kind, and be cool, as video games are meant to be fun."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-the-pawn-shop-not-working-in-schedule-1-pawn-shop-guy-missing-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pawn Shop’s doors were opened in Schedule 1 in April 2025. It offers a new way to manage your inventory, make money, and cause chaos. This guide runs through everything you need to know, including overcoming the missing pawn guy scenario.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 7 update</a> was a big one for Schedule 1. The developer added a lot more content to the drug-dealing game, such as the Bleuballs Boutique, wall-mounting features, and the Pawn Shop. The latter allows you to sell goods for money and not have to waste goods by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping them on the floor</a>.</p>



<p>However, we first need to find the Pawn Shop, work out why the owner is sometimes not there, and how to use it.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">Where is The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the circle. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is directly south of the Motel Room location—and is one building across the road from it.</strong></p>



<p>Again, worst case, you can consult our <strong>map screenshot above</strong> for the precise location of the Pawn Shop. <a href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1</a> doesn’t signpost everything like in other RPGs. But we like this as it’s quite liberating and encourages you to explore. </p>



<p>But if you want the Pawn Shop, follow these instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Motel Room in Northtown</strong> (which you unlock for $75).</li>



<li>Exit the room and walk forward.</li>



<li>Turn right at the<strong> ATM</strong>.</li>



<li>Walk in a straight line past the bus stop.</li>



<li>Cross the road.</li>



<li>You’re at the Pawn Shop!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-pawn-shop-guy-not-there-in-schedule-1">Why is the Pawn Shop Guy Not There in Schedule 1? </h2>



<p><strong>If the Pawn Shop guy isn’t there when you go in, the game has glitched, and you need to save and reload the game to make him appear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-guy-is-missing">Pawn Shop Guy is Missing</h3>



<p>It’s well-known that the development team for Schedule 1 is very small. Glitches and bugs will get into the system from time to time. The Pawn Shop guy going AWOL is a common occurrence for Schedule 1 players.</p>



<p>If this happens, do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Pawn Shop, and if it’s open, check if the guy is behind the counter.</li>



<li>If he’s not, you need to save your game.</li>



<li>You do this by <strong>sleeping or using the Intercom device</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, close down Schedule 1.</li>



<li>Boot it up again.</li>



<li>When you’re back into the action, head to the Pawn Shop again.</li>



<li>Hopefully, the Pawn Shop person should be there.</li>



<li>If he’s not, <strong>rinse and repeat these instructions until it works</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>This bug surely has a fix in development by TVGS. For now, this is a simple workaround.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">How to Unlock The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I see you’re here today. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is automatically unlocked in Schedule 1, but you need to make sure you arrive between 6 AM and 6 PM.</strong></p>



<p>Pawn Shop guy gives you a generous 12-hour window to visit the establishment. If you arrive out of hours, the shop is closed, leaving you unable to benefit from its services. Come back at the right time to trade in your trinkets.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 roadmap</a> is exciting and gives us a sneak peek into the content TVGS is cooking up.

Yesterday, Sony announced it was doing the exact opposite, raising the price of the PlayStation 5 in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Africa.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/"><span><span><span><span>announcement on the PS Blog</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> does not give a single concrete reason for the price hike, instead citing "a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates." While similar announcements might precede the price change by days or weeks, this increase was put in place nearly immediately and was set in stone today, April 14. While some regions will only see increased prices on the Digital Edition, others, like Australia, have price increases across the board. However, the price of the PS5 Pro will remain unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The blog listed some of the price updates in different parts of the world but left out specifics for the Middle East and Africa, instead pointing people to consult local retailers. Prices for other regions are listed below.</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-already-has-season-1-beat.1164378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that the first episode of the second season of HBO’s The Last of Us saw a viewership boost of 10% over the first season. In a report, it was mentioned that 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers were recorded, which is up 10% from the 4.7 million viewers who tuned into the first episode in 2023.</p>



<p>The first season went on to be the largest audience for an HBO debut season <strong>ever</strong>, so the running expectation is that the second season of The Last of Us will go even further.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-apocalypse">Return of the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>The Last of Us is one of the most iconic post-apocalyptic franchises in gaming history. It emerged in 2013 as a single-player, narrative-driven title from Naughty Dog, the creators of Uncharted. It turned heads back then on the PlayStation 3, and it continues to do so today.</p>



<p>In 2020, Naughty Dog released The Last of Us Part II, which is the game that season two of the HBO live-action adaptation is centered on. The first season covered the events of the first game, but the second game is heftier and will take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-first-half/">multiple seasons to cover in full</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-season-2-premiere-viewership-hbo-1236368374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, more viewers have tuned into the second season than the first – 10% more, in fact.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of the growing popularity of the series, which has an uncertain future at Naughty Dog. It was suggested by Neil Druckmann, the franchise’s creator, that there won’t be another game, but he later backtracked on those comments.</p>



<p>The television series has drawn unfortunate criticism, mostly aimed at Bella Ramsay, who plays the lead role of Ellie Williams. It has long been said that they’re not the best representation of the character, and their <strong>youthful appearance </strong>isn’t accurate compared to the game character that they’re based on.</p>



<p>It’s a sticking point, but viewership is up, and that’s all HBO really cares about.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the popularity of the show, Naughty Dog recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/">The Last of Us Complete</a>, a special edition that is comprised of <strong>both </strong>The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II, exclusively on PS5.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/video-game-blogs-old-media-2000s</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-blogs-from-the-2000s-were-fast-reckless-and-very-bad-at-news.1164333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-blogs-old-media-2000s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people looooooooove to talk shit about Kotaku, a publication that all of us here at Aftermath used to work at. Over the last 20+ years the site has been at the vanguard of changing tastes and practices in video games journalism, which means that while it has done (and continues to do!) some amazing work, it has also made its fair share of mistakes and missteps along the way.</p><p>That's what happens when you're always trying to do something new. It's also what happens when you're a small and overworked group of human beings and you work at a larger company where leadership has its own ideas. For all of people's continued teeth-gnashing about the site--much of which is rooted in culture war bullshit--the site was also part of a trend in video game journalism, particularly in the mid-to-late-2000s, that I think has permanently altered how readers understand video game news.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this intro, I am not going to be singling out any one person or website for criticism here. I led with Kotaku, and will mention it a few more times as an example, because I used to work there and so have the most experience with it. But you can substitute its name for any of its competitors, from Joystiq to Destructoid to VG247 to early-days Polygon, and the story will be the same. Like so many other issues with video games media--and all media, really--the problems I'm going to be talking about here are systemic, which maybe makes them easier to handwave away, but also more difficult to address. And the problem with sites like Kotaku, in the 2000s especially, is that they helped utterly devalue the way we consume news about this medium.</p><p>For much of Kotaku's early life (we're talking roughly 2004-2010ish), it had an intentionally basic site design. Instead of trying to mimic the format of a newspaper or traditional (for the time) website, with little pictures and headlines all over the place, Kotaku was built entirely around a chronological feed of blogs, each post going down the page in order and rewarding readers who sat around mashing F5 with fresh new content every 30-60 minutes. When a new story was published, it slid the top of the page, bumping the last post down. After a day or two, news that normal people might still have been learning about organically had moved off the front page altogether.</p><p>(We actually have, for the true Aftermath sicko who hits F5...2-3 times a day,<a href="https://aftermath.site/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> our own version of this</a>).</p><p>This is why I was hired! Living in Australia, I was awake during the twilight hours in the US, and so could just keep the machine rolling 24/7 until my American colleagues woke up the next morning. We would publish blog after blog, every 20-30 minutes until the dying of the sun. For those addicted to the news cycle, who felt like they needed to know everything about video games, it must have been incredible: even 20 years ago, Kotaku had hundreds of thousands of devoted, regular readers.</p><p>At the time, for those of us running the site and making money off it, this felt perfect. It was everything we could have wanted from the still-kinda-new internet age.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-new-games-journalism-same-as-the-old-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Video games media at the time was obsessed with breaking from the past, with treating the medium and its industry more seriously</a>, and so a single website finding space for both the irreverent and the important all on the one page was, even by 2005-06, a <em>huge </em>success.</p><p>On a longer timeframe, though, the relentlessness of Kotaku and its competitors' coverage ended up equating the irreverent <em>with </em>the important. When everything was published on the same site in the same format on the same schedule and given roughly the same prominence, how was anyone supposed to know what was truly important? If you scrolled down the page of a 2000s video games blog you'd see a story about 300 layoffs followed by a Tekken trailer followed by a photo of a Mario cake. It created a news landscape where lots of things were happening all the time, but everything looked just as newsworthy and important as everything else.</p><figure><figcaption>"50 posts in the last 24 hours" - Kotaku's masthead from 2008</figcaption></figure><p>This firehose approach to coverage helped foster a culture, now decades-old, where <em>everything </em>happening in and around video games is deemed important simply for existing, from the most inane press release to a game's third trailer to a quote from a CEO nobody really needs to be listening to. The fast pace of the site’s updates gave everything a sense of urgency that was like feeding a reader’s addiction to the news cycle, giving them endless ammunition to fight pointless console wars and pore over the most meaningless details.</p><p>That's some ruinous shit! Nobody needed to be kept up to date on the barbs thrown by bickering executives; nobody needed to be drip-fed bullet points from a marketing campaign. And it was strange for the subjects of our coverage too; <a href="https://aftermath.site/tweet-roundup-buzzfeed-kotaku-internet-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we've recently discussed</a>, nobody needed to have their personal thoughts on something fed into an international news cycle, while many developers lived in fear of saying <em>anything </em>in public, lest it be seized upon and posted, quite often entirely out of context, just because some blogger thought it sounded like an interesting soundbyte.</p><p>By the end of the 2000s the video games media landscape was covering so much “news” on a daily basis you could go mad if you stared directly at it for too long. It meant video games had fallen into a familiar hole; the dawn of cable news had the same disruptive effect on TV, and everyone from Gawker to Buzzfeed were doing the same thing to other types of websites. Even mainstream news outlets have struggled in the modern age to properly contextualise their work when so much of it relies on algorithms and social media sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, I can't find any one person to blame. Nick Denton had us all working like dogs in the early days of Kotaku--paying bloggers $10 per post in 2006 instead of a salary sure did incentivise us to find any old shit to toss on the website--but our rivals were structured in much the same way. Kotaku's early leadership weren't expressly seeking to devalue news either; we honestly believed at the time that we were showing all the sides of an exploding scene and industry, giving people everything they could want to learn, see or know about video games.</p><p>(It should be noted that while by the 2010s nearly every major video game website had moved its staffers into salaried positions, the pay-per-post model still exists today at networks like Gamurs and Valnet, <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose own reliance on tips, guides and a non-stop “news” cycle perpetuates many of those 2000’s problems for whole new generations</a>).</p><p>The system did what systems do, though, and it's only with the benefit of hindsight that I've been able to look back and really survey the wreckage. I can at least apologise for my part in that system: For every developer or executive quote I lifted into a headline because it would "do numbers", for every benign E3 announcement I treated like it was actually important, for every Reddit or Twitter drama I elevated from personal squabble to international news.</p><p>I can only hope that given a fresh start here at Aftermath, and with the perspective of all the work we've done in the past, we can do something better for the future. Something that operates at a slower pace, that gives us as writers the luxury of deciding if something really is worth covering. Something that’s able to properly contextualise an event so readers can better understand if it’s a fun distraction in their day or something major they need to take their time with. We still think there’s space for all kinds of stories on a video game website, but we want just that–<em>space</em>–so we can help readers understand the video game landscape and leave our worst habits where so much of that 2000s games coverage belongs: forgotten.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><h3>How Xalavier Nelson Does It</h3></a><p>"The systems you set up give you the life that you live in.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to find a bigger video game success story in 2025 than Schedule 1. The drug-dealing simulator has taken over the industry, but can you play Schedule 1 on Steam Deck? </p>



<p>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer as you work your way up in the world and build an empire. The breakout title is a hit, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/#:~:text=Schedule%201%20is%20a%20Sleeper,Million%20Concurrent%20Players%20%2D%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing 412,000 </a>players at its peak just 10 days after launch. The momentum shows no signs of slowing down, as there is a steady stream of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>.</p>



<p>Despite being so popular, Schedule 1 isn’t available on all platforms. Here is everything you need to know about Steam Deck compatibility. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-playable-on-steam-deck">Is Schedule 1 Playable on Steam Deck?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>No,</strong> <strong>Schedule 1 is not playable on Steam Deck. </strong></p>



<p>Despite Schedule 1 being on Steam, the game isn’t compatible with the Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Steam Deck users aren’t the only ones left behind. Clones of Schedule 1 have appeared on the PlayStation Store, but the real game isn’t available on consoles.</p>



<p> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler1</a>, the leading developer at TVGS, cleared up any confusion and said, “As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.” </p>



<p>He continued, “I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens.” </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-schedule-1-coming-to-steam-deck">When is Schedule 1 Coming to Steam Deck?</h2>



<p><strong>Schedule 1 has no official Steam Deck release date but is in development. </strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/503947989263319048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 10 update</a>, Tyler1 revealed, “I’m also looking into improving optimization. I’d like to get Steam Deck officially supported as soon as possible, so that’ll act as my performance benchmark.” </p>



<p>Tyler1 did not provide a timeline for improving optimization, but ‘soon as possible’ means fans won’t have to wait too long. </p>



<p>We will provide an update when Steam Deck users can finally join in on the fun. </p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not the best time to be a fan of handheld gaming. Leaks suggest that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portable version of the PlayStation 6</a> won’t be as powerful as the PS5. In addition, the Nintendo Switch 2s from China could face a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US tariff</a>, which could raise the price, and games are believed to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upwards of $90</a>. </p>

            <p>
FromSoftware's seminal action-RPG Dark Souls now has seamless co-op, courtesy of the modder behind similar co-op overhauls for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
Modder Yui initially <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">made headlines through their work on Elden Ring</a>, stripping away some of its co-operative faff so players could adventure and battle bosses together seamlessly. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-3-modder-adds-seamless-co-op-overhaul-nine-years-after-release">similar mod arrived for Dark Souls 3</a> earlier this year, and now it's the turn of FromSoftware's stone cold classic Dark Souls, which gets seamless co-op some 14 years after its original release.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' Seamless Co-op mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899">available to download now on NexusMods</a> and works very much like Yui's earlier mods, introducing a special custom item used to summon up to five additional players into a game. Once in a multiplayer session participants will notice some major differences compared to how things work in the base game.

<figcaption>Here's a look at the Dark Souls Seamless Co-op mod in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdZ1-uk9h8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If a players dies, for instance, they'll spawn at the last bonfire they visited rather than being booted from the session, and clearing areas or defeating bosses won't disband play either. Additionally, when one player rests at a bonfire, the world will reset for everyone; NPC dialogue and events are synchronised for all players; all fog walls and barriers designed to restrict multiplayer zones are removed, and game progression made during a multiplayer session will also progress the game in your own world.
</p>
<p>
Yui has also implemented configurable multiplayer difficulty scaling for all enemies, and says that while seamless co-op makes Dark Souls "significantly easier", the mod's default scaling settings should be enjoyable while 'somewhat preserving the game's challenge'. Notably, players can't immediately spawn back into a boss fight on death - they'll instead be turned into a spectator until either everyone in the party is defeated or a player rests at a bonfire.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' seamless co-op mod - which also supports Invasions - is currently at the alpha stage, meaning it's "very likely" to contain bugs. Using it won't, however, result in a ban, given it utilises an overhauled peer-to-peer connection system rather than FromSoftware's servers. The mod even creates a different save file to keep things separate in case you want to play the vanilla game at the same time - although Yui warns that attempting to revert a mod saved file to a vanilla save <em>will</em> likely result in a ban.
</p>
<p>
Yui's Dark Souls mod comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">FromSoftware's multiplayer-focused Nightreign</a>, in which up to three players can work together to defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">new and familiar challenges from Elden Ring and other From games</a> - including The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 30th May - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is also getting its own bit of FromSoftware multiplayer in the form of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">recently revealed The Duskbloods</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-cut-content-included-a-bird-flight-level-and-a-headless-astro<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot fans have all heard the story of the creation of the sponge power-up, but did you know developer Team Asobi also prototyped even wackier powers, like a coffee grinder and a roulette wheel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn't, until IGN attended GDC 2025, where Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet gave a talk simply titled, "The Making of 'ASTRO BOT'". In his talk, Doucet went in-depth on the process of creating the PlayStation mascot platformer, including showing off a number of early prototype images and cut content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doucet began his talk by talking about the initial pitch for Astro Bot, which was written in May 2021, just a few months after Team Asobi began prototyping it. According to him, there were 23 different revisions of the pitch before it was shown to top management. Their pitch was apparently initially given as an adorable comic strip showing off the main pillars and activities of the game. Clearly, it was a success.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-155922-1744664393106.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A slide from Nicholas Doucet's GDC talk, The Making of 'ASTRO BOT', showing a comic book explanation of the game's pitch.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, Doucet explained how the team generated ideas. The answer, unshockingly, is a lot of brainstorming, but what Team Asobi did was form small groups of 5-6 people that mix individuals from different disciplines together. Everyone wrote or drew ideas on individual sticky notes, leading to this absolutely incredible brainstorming board image:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-160551-1744664805351.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Another slide from the talk, showing sticky note brainstorms from Team Asobi.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every idea made it to the next phase, prototyping, Doucet said. In fact, only around 10% of their brainstorms actually got made. But that was still a <em>lot</em> of prototyping. Doucet went on to talk about the importance of prototyping all sorts of things, explaining that everyone on the team was encouraged to prototype ideas they had. This included departments outside of game design, such as an example where audio designers made a theater inside Astro Bot to prototype haptic controller vibrations that corresponded to different sound effects, such as the different ways a door can open and close.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-161410-1744665609954.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Another slide from the talk, showing a sponge prototype alongside concept art of Astro Bot becoming a sponge.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prototyping was so important to the Astro Bot team, Doucet said, that a few programmers on the team were reserved to prototype things that had nothing to do with platforming. That's where Astro Bot's sponge mechanic came from - they prototyped a sponge that squeezed dry using the adaptive trigger, it was fun, and it became a part of the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-161342-1744665284232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Another slide from the talk showing various prototype activities that were made for Astro Bot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doucet shared the above image, which included a number of such prototypes that were made, but never turned into Astro Bot mechanics, alongside those that did. You can see the balloon and sponge, which were used, alongside prototypes of what looks like a tennis game, a little walking wind-up toy, a roulette wheel, a coffee grinder, and several more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the talk, Doucet also discussed how levels were selected and designed around certain mechanics. The goal, he said, was for every level to have unique gameplay of some kind and never feel too similar to another level. While that doesn't mean that Astro Bot could never use the same power-up on more than one level, Doucet said that the expression of it had to be different enough each time to make the level feel unique. For instance, he showed some images of a cut level themed around bird flights that was cut due to reusing Astro Bot's monkey power-up in ways that were a bit too similar to the level Go-Go Archipelago, as well as another level in Astro's Playroom that had a similar power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the end, it was decided that the overlap was not healthy enough to create variety, and we just cut this level entirely," he said. "We'll never know if that level would have been popular. But in hindsight, I think it's a good thing that we got to spend that time elsewhere."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-161605-1744665388319.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Another slide, showing a cut level from Astro Bot alongside two other implemented levels.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally Doucet closed the talk by talking about the game's final scene, and yes, this is <strong>Spoilers if you haven't finished Astro Bot yet. Read on at your own risk.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the final scene of Astro Bot, the player reassembles a broken Astro Bot using limbs and assistance from the other gathered bots. According to Doucet, originally the player was just handed a completely dismembered Astro. No head, no limbs, just the torso. But Doucet said that this made some people "really upset", so they went with the slightly more intact version we see in the existing game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/screenshot-2025-04-14-161754-1744665503160.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A clip from Doucet's presentation showing the original ending of Astro Bot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doucet's talk included a number of other interesting nuggets and tidbits about the development of Astro Bot.
