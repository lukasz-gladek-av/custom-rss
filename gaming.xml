<figure data-uuid="6b385640a56aa"><a title="Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b385640a56aa/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nile Bowie / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Few games have tapped into the popular zeitgeist quite like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> did back in 2020 at the onset of the global pandemic. It’s sold a whopping 48.62 million copies worldwide since launch, elevating Animal Crossing from a fan-favourite series to a full-fledged cultural phenomenon, earning its place alongside Nintendo’s top-tier mascots.</p>
<p>Given all its success, it’s hard to believe just how far the series had fallen with its previous home console entry. Years before New Horizons turned debt repayment into a cosy form of self-care, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/animal_crossing_amiibo_festival">Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival</a> for the Wii U had already cemented itself not only as the franchise’s most divisive entry but as a contender for one of Nintendo’s worst games. It’s even been blamed for putting YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/gUSTyhGCAlE?si=ptvoYh4-ZVoWl5Xa">Scott the Woz in therapy</a>.</p>
<p>When Amiibo Festival hit shelves exactly a decade ago, Nintendo was all-in on experimenting with toys-to-life gimmicks and, following the success of 2013’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on the 3DS, anticipation was high for a new mainline entry that would finally bring the series into HD on a home console. But the reality check came faster than you could scan an amiibo.</p>

<p>Fans were disappointed, to say the least, when Nintendo opted to release a board game instead of a proper new Animal Crossing instalment. The frustration only deepened once <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/animal_crossing_amiibo_festival">the reviews</a> rolled in. The game bombed. Reviewers slammed it for being more of a <em>bored game</em> than a board game, taking aim at its price tag, sedate pacing, and overreliance on amiibo scanning.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Amiibo Festival's dire reputation has always intrigued me. When I found a copy on clearance around two years ago, I gave in to temptation to see if it really was as bad as everyone said. I also managed to snag nearly the entire line of amiibos online for a few dollars.</p>
<p>My general impression at the time was that the game was relatively harmless. I played it with my partner, and it worked well enough as a low-stakes way to soak up Animal Crossing vibes when I had already bounced off tending to my overgrown New Horizons island after 200+ hours. It certainly helped that I paid way less for it than the $59.99 MSRP sticker price at release, along with finding the figures and two packs of cards for a song.</p>
<p>With the game’s 10th anniversary upon us, I decided it was time for a proper reappraisal. So, I gathered three friends — all fans of board games and dedicated New Horizons players with hundreds of hours under their belts — and set up an Amiibo Festival night. This was the perfect test group, in theory, exactly the kind of audience Nintendo had in mind back in 2015.</p>
<p>Our mission was to find out if Amiibo Festival has any redeeming qualities, or if it truly deserves its place among Nintendo’s most notorious misfires...</p>
<h2>Terminally chill</h2>
<figure data-uuid="011d351527fcf"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/011d351527fcf/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of us were looking to dunk on it. We approached it with open minds, wondering whether time might reveal a misunderstood oddity or a bit of overlooked charm in hindsight.</p>
<p>What we found was a game that captures the cosy spirit of Animal Crossing to a tee. But where other social multiplayer titles like Mario Party offset luck-driven board play with skill-based minigames to create lively chaos, this one “just depends on your patience,” as one friend remarked midway through our session, neatly summing up Amiibo Festival’s entire gameplay loop: scan, roll, and read.</p>
<p>It’s played with a single Wii U GamePad. You take turns scanning your amiibo figures to roll the dice, moving your characters the number of spaces shown. Each space either grants or deducts Happy Points and Bells — akin to Mario Party’s Stars and Coins — and triggers a short, text-based slice-of-life vignette accompanied by a brief cutscene.</p>
<p>Each space tells a wholesome little story, ranging from earning Bells for helping a villager to losing Happy Points because seagulls ate the turnips you planned to sell on the Stalk Market – outcomes that are entirely luck-based. These moments are charming in theory and undeniably in tune with Animal Crossing’s cosy ethos, but they have no gameplay consequence.</p>

<p>Occasionally, events break up the monotony. Familiar characters appear on certain days, with Joan the turnip vendor offering the most mechanically interesting feature: you can invest Bells in her stock of turnips, then try to sell them later as prices fluctuate across different board spaces. It’s a small flicker of strategy in an otherwise automated board game.</p>
<p>Before starting a round, you choose a month of the year, with the board reflecting the corresponding season. Snow blankets the town in winter, cherry blossoms bloom in spring, and seasonal characters like Jack, the self-proclaimed Czar of Halloween, appear during October. But it’s all largely a reskin; the core gameplay remains the same no matter the month.</p>
<p>After every player completes their move, the in-game calendar advances by one day. The cycle repeats until the month ends, at which point Bells convert into Happy Points and a winner is declared. Before starting the board game, you can adjust the session length. A full playthrough with four players took us around 75 minutes.</p>
<h2>Charm offended</h2>
<p>By the end of our session, opinions were split. Two players said they enjoyed it for what it was. “It’s cute and chill,” one said, praising the cheerful music and charming event cutscenes. Another said its appeal lies more in treating it as a lightly interactive background activity, something to half-play while chatting and sharing snacks.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9fa6c519d60dc"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fa6c519d60dc/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others in the group were less charitable. One gave it a “three or four out of ten.” They admitted they only enjoyed themselves “because we were all playing together,” adding, “the people were fun, not the game.” When it came time for a final score, the group average settled around a 5/10, with everyone agreeing the game fails to do enough to keep you engaged.</p>
<p>I asked whether Amiibo Festival really deserved its reputation as one of Nintendo’s worst games, and the group was divided. One immediately agreed, calling it “definitely one of the worst Nintendo games I’ve played.” Another pushed back, saying it was “a bit harsh” and that “you can tell they tried.” The problem, they argued, isn’t a lack of care but a lack of <em>game</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it may be the most passive party game ever conceived. The decision to keep Amiibo Festival’s minigames separate from the main board game could explain why the proceedings felt monotonous. Then again, it’s hard to say a combined mode would be any more fun. The eight minigames on offer can only be accessed by scanning amiibo cards and are unlocked gradually as you play the main mode.</p>
<p>Cramming these into the board game would be an exercise in logistics. Imagine juggling a Wii U GamePad, an amiibo figure, and several amiibo cards, all of which would need to be scanned mid-round if minigames suddenly appeared. The idea of pausing play to put down your amiibo, scan in cards, and pass the GamePad around the room all feels excessively cumbersome.</p>

<p>These standalone minigames don’t set the world on fire, but certainly add to the package, showcasing how that Amiibo Festival isn’t completely devoid of gameplay. Desert Island Escape emerges as the standout – a lightly strategic, single-player turn-based survival mode where players gather resources, craft tools, and build a raft to escape a deserted island.</p>
<p>A few others, like Balloon Island and the trivia-style Quiz Show, have their charms, but most are built around clunky amiibo-card scanning that feels forced and unnecessary. Two of the minigames require six cards to play — more than the three bundled in with the game — implying an additional purchase just to access all the content on the disc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Does it feel like this game was made to sell amiibos?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“Is scanning an amiibo to roll dice fun?”<br>
“No.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therein lies the core problem with Amiibo Festival: it feels less like a game designed around amiibo and more like one designed to <em>sell</em> them. The consensus among my test group was that its central mechanic — scanning figures to roll dice — felt like a marketing mandate, not an idea born from gameplay. Everyone agreed that doing so every turn quickly became tedious.</p>
<h2>Post-amiibo clarity</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e29326ab8e1fa"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e29326ab8e1fa/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My hunch is that Amiibo Festival would be far less hated if it had been released for free on the eShop and been framed as a nifty value-add for those who bought the Animal Crossing amiibo and card sets, rather than as a full-priced retail title. At least then, it might’ve been remembered as an inoffensive curiosity rather than a complete commercial misfire.</p>
<p>A decade on, Amiibo Festival feels like a relic from a time when Nintendo was grasping for direction, convinced that toys-to-life was its next big thing. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the company — and the series — found its footing. The runaway success of New Horizons proved there was no need for gimmicks. And as disappointing as its predecessor is, I don’t think I’ll need therapy.</p>

            <p>Over 200 staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar North have signed a letter to management calling for the "immediate reinstatement" of 31 workers fired recently by the company. Rockstar claimed they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired these staffers for "gross misconduct"</a>, subsequently accusing them of sharing confidential info publicly. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The union have also held protests outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two's UK offices</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/rockstar-open-letter-13-11-25/">according to the IWGB</a>, a letter signed by 220 staff at Edinburgh-based Rockstar North has been delivered to the studio's management. The letter calls for the "immediate reinstatement" of the fired workers, and condemns the decision to boot them out of their jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>"It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Meanwhile, IWGB organiser Fred Carter called the firings an "Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry". More union protests against Rockstar are planned in the very near future, with an 8AM rally outside Take Two’s London office and a 4PM CET protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters - the latter staged by the French STJV (Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo) union - set to take place on November 14th. There's also a protest set to take place at 6PM on November 18th outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, timed to coincide with a cross-party parliamentary group meeting about the Scottish games industry.</p>
<p>GTA 6 remains a spectre now lurking on November 19th, 2026, following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">most recent delay</a> around the time news of the firings broke.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change-2000643948</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change.1352767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to spend $1,100 on the latest <em>Fenix 8</em> to get a serious running watch that tracks everything you need. The sweet spot in Garmin’s lineup has always been the <em>Forerunner</em> series, and for good reason: these watches outsell everything else in the brand’s catalog. The Forerunner 265 is the most premium and popular model in the range and packs a brilliant AMOLED display and advanced training metrics that rival watches costing twice as much. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/">just quietly marked it down to $299, slashed from its usual $449 price tag</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low</strong> for a watch that delivers fantastic running features without the extreme price of Garmin’s flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Runners Keep Picking This Watch</h2>
<p>The difference is apparent from the very first moments you fire up the Forerunner 265: that <strong>brilliant AMOLED touchscreen pops with color and sharp text</strong>&nbsp;which remains quite readable under direct sunlight, joined by traditional button controls that work beautifully when your hands are sweaty or you’re wearing gloves. The <strong>46mm size</strong> makes the watch feather-light on your wrist so you just about forget it’s there on those ultra-long runs-or really through most of the day. Get <strong>up to 13 days of battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> and up to 20 hours in GPS mode to give you plenty of juice for training weeks.</p>
<p>Your day begins with a personalized report which provides context for how to approach each and every training day. Upon waking, you get an overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook alongside HRV status, training readiness, and local weather. This information helps you decide if today is the day to push hard or if your body needs an easier session. The training readiness score brings together <strong>sleep quality, recovery, training load, and HRV status</strong> to tell you if you’re primed to go hard and get the most out of your workout.</p>



<p>Race preparation becomes strategic with <strong>personalized daily suggested workouts</strong>. You input your target race and course details into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch creates training plans that adapt after every run to match your current performance and recovery status. The race widget on your watch keeps your goal front and center while the workouts adapt as your body responds to training.</p>



<p>Multi-band GNSS technology with SatIQ provides accuracy in positioning that more affordable watches simply cannot attain. This matters when you’re running in areas with tall buildings, heavy tree cover, or challenging terrain where the basic GPS signals struggle. Optimizing this accuracy for battery life means you won’t be sacrificing runtime to get accurate distance and pace. You <strong>have more than 30 built-in activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, open-water swimming, and lots more</strong>.</p>
<p>Safety features add peace of mind during solo training sessions. <strong>Incident detection works</strong> during select outdoor activities and sends a message with your live location to emergency contacts when paired with your compatible smartphone. The <em>Assistance</em> feature lets you manually trigger an alert when you need help, something that is good to have when you are exploring new routes or training in remote areas.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting a watch that competes directly with models costing $600 or more.</p>

              <p>Some of the biggest games of the year are getting new difficulty options. Some of the biggest companies would kindly like their workers to quietly leave. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of gaming news and culture. <a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/product-ideas/0046a36e-c287-4ddf-9ff2-dc1b553dfde1">This Lego arcade</a> is one of my favorite new proposed fan sets. It would go perfectly in that giant Lego city I have no time or money for building in my attic.</p> <h2>Krafton will let developers voluntarily resign as it doubles down on AI</h2> <p>The <em>PUBG</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher</a> will allow employees based in South Korea to be part of a new voluntary resignation program that gives anywhere from six months to three years of severance,<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette"><em>Business Korea</em> reports</a>. Krafton says the plan isn’t aimed at sneaking through “soft” layoffs, but is “to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation,” according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">a translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The news comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">Krafton committed $70 million</a> in investment for GPU clusters to drive its agentic AI transformation and as fellow South Korea publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">Nexon suggested</a> adopting generative AI technology is a matter of survival.</p> <h2>220 <em>GTA 6</em> devs signed a letter blasting the firing of 31 colleagues</h2> <p>The IGWB trade union group in the UK announced on Thursday that the letter was delivered to Rockstar management. It accused the company of union busting and demanded the reinstatement of the previously fired developers. French union STJV is planning a protest in front of Take-Two France on Friday.</p>

 <p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account—during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down,” one of the fired employees said in a statement. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p>

 <h2>Could <em>GTA 6</em>‘s delay also delay the launch of the PS6?</h2> <p>That’s the thought experiment one recently analyst proposed. “We are currently forecasting a next-gen PlayStation and Xbox to arrive in late 2027–but might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the <em>GTA 6</em> wave and waiting until 2028?” Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6">posed the idea to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the <em>GTA</em> franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies.”</p>

 <p>The idea here is that GTA 6 will lead to a spike in new console sales that will dramatically increase the current-gen install base. If that peak doesn’t come until early 2027, console makers might have an incentive to wait a bit before pushing out their next hardware release. But as Harding-Rolls also points out, backwards compatibility makes that less of an issue these days.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is the latest monster-taming RPG in the series to forgo voice acting. As these games have become more cinematic, it’s become pretty jarring that these characters don’t have voices when they speak. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has fully animated scenes in which characters’ mouths flap as they speak, but no sound actually comes out. As such, fans have been making their own voice dubs of the series for years, and there are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2iFaaUZo9M"><span>some pretty good ones out there</span></a><span>. There’s also a deeply unserious one by </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485">Final Fantasy XVI</a> </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> actor Ben Starr playing Naveen from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> completely straight with his usual broody delivery.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent episode of the Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, Starr “auditioned” for the role, with co-hosts Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang acting alongside him as the protagonist and Taunie. Starr, hilariously, makes no attempt to capture Naveen’s youth and pretty much whips out his gravely Clive voice from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span>. If you’ve ever wanted to hear Starr be a broody simp for a Pokémon streamer, here’s your chance.</span></p>   <p><span>It’s a funny bit and I have to applaud the artistic choices made with a mostly straight face here, but it does underline that a lot of the character of these games can be dialed up and enhanced with a good voice actor in the booth. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> definitely shows that Game Freak has the writing chops to execute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>some really funny, memorable scenes and jokes</span></a><span> despite not including voice acting, but every time I hear a fan try to embody these characters, I just wish the games had that same spark we get in projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389">anime</a> or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i></a><span>games. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes a baby step toward this future by giving your main character Link-like grunts and yells when they do some actions, but they’re one person in a city full of heroes and villains that I’d love to hear speak instead of just reading. Don’t get me started on that weird scene in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>where a whole concert was happening just for a character to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC9vQmmvvfI"><span>pantomime the performance instead of singing</span></a><span>. Though that’s also </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecamsteady/video/7536409709599870222"><span>allowed fans to interpret that character’s musical chops</span></a><span>, as well.</span></p>

This looks to be a unique-colored Tangrowth in an outfit, rather than a new regional form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weirder still, however, are a ghostly pale version of regular Pikachu, and a mossy Snorlax that has a pale flower growing out of his head. Again, these are not specified to be new regional forms, but the trailer deliberately leaves it unclear exactly what these new designs are meant to suggest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the freshly-updated Pokémon Pokopia website, these creatures are given character names, though still appear to be based on the species' regular forms.

                <p>During the final week of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar Games fired more than 30 employees</a> across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. Rockstar subsequently claimed that the staff members were let go for "gross misconduct," but the employees contend that they were terminated for attempting to organize with a union. Now, the battle over those labor moves may be heading to court.</p><p>Over 200 Rockstar employees have signed letters demanding that their colleagues be reinstated to their jobs. The fired workers were all members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, and the organization has called Rockstar's actions "the most ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The fired staff members have been joined by current employees and other supporters for protests outside of the offices for Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive. Additional protests are planned for the company's offices in London and Paris later this week.</p><p>IWGB representatives have pushed back against Rockstar's claims that the ex-employees leaked sensitive information about the company or its games in the union's Discord channels. Additionally, the IWGB has filed formal legal claims against Rockstar that may be a precursor towards a long battle in court.</p><p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account--during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," wrote one of the former employees, whose real name was withheld. "It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Rockstar has already made the prediction that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> launch will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/" data-ref-id="1100-6534732">the biggest video game debut in history</a>. The release date was recently pushed back to November 19, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar is estimated to be on the hook for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">$60 million in losses</a> due to the game's delay.</p>

GTA 5, meanwhile, was recently <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/" data-target="true">re-introduced to PlayStation Plus.</a></p><h2><strong>Next big GTA Online update in December</strong></h2><p>Rockstar has steadily updated GTA Online over the years, and the next big update in December will add mansion properties that people can buy.</p><p>"There's a new entrant in the Los Santos high-end real estate scene, and they're making moves into some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. Prix Luxury Real Estate has ambitious plans, bringing new unrivaled mansion properties to this lucrative market in December," Rockstar said.</p><p>Prior to the December update, people can take on three new missions related to the update that will pay out double GTA$ and RP, or quadruple those rates for GTA+ members. People who complete the missions will be able to buy the new mansion properties for a discount of GTA$ 2 million off what they will cost for people who don't do the missions.</p><p>People who complete all three missions also get a cash injection of GTA$ 1 million, along with cosmetics for their character. And anyone who simply logs in to GTA Online between now and December 7 will earn "Black Tier VIP" status, which entitles them to a free Ubermacht Revolter car.</p><p>The GTA Online freebie offer comes just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 to November 2026</a>. And in other Rockstar-related news, the ESRB just recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-rated-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536175/" data-ref-id="1100-6536175">posted a rating for Red Dead Redemption for modern consoles</a>, sparking speculation about a possible remaster.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have rolled out a new update for Silent Hill f that introduces a new Casual action difficulty. In addition, the patch notes point to an added skip feature for New Game+ players, faster stamina replenishment for <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Hinako_Shimizu" rel="nofollow ">Hinako</a>, and enemy reductions in certain areas.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a laundry list of bug fixes with the new Silent Hill f update, too, according to <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/news/us/en/patch-note_v110" rel="nofollow ">Konami's website</a>. Interestingly, it's noted that the Casual action difficulty can be selected from the start, or the survival-horror game will offer it up as an option upon dying a certain amount of times. The skipping sections feature for New Game+ is optional as well, with Konami noting it won't "impact branching paths or endings."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill F Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill f system changes all sound like they're making the game a bit easier across the board. Along with quicker stamina recharging and fewer enemies, the patch notes state that "unskippable combat encounters" have been skimmed down. Plus, even the Hard action difficulty is reducing damage a tad to Hinako.</p><p dir="ltr">Launching in September,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/"> Silent Hill f sold over 1 million copies</a> in just 24 hours. That means the game hit the sales milestone faster than the Silent Hill 2 remake, developed by Bloober Team. Speaking of which, Bloober Team is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/">working on a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. There is also a new movie adaptation for the franchise coming in the next couple of months: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser-brings-back-an-iconic-monster/1100-6534296/">Return to Silent Hill</a>, based on Silent Hill 2, is planned to premiere in theaters on January 23.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/"> Silent Hill f review</a>.

<p>"Announced in front of a packed auditorium at the Disney+ Originals Preview at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, executive producer of the series’ Hideo Kojima, and the series’ director Takayuki Sano, appeared on stage to announce that their first ever partnership with a global streaming platform will be with Disney+ and that the latest expansion of the Death Stranding franchise will be an animated series," according to the announcement post. "New concept art created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em>, was also revealed along with the <em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> (working title) announcement."</p><p><strong>Here's the full synopsis of </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Isolations</strong></em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Once, there was an explosion...</em></p><p><em>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</em></p><p><em>Based on the video game born out of the mind of legendary game creator, Hideo Kojima, comes a new animation series headed by Japan’s up-and-coming animation studio E&amp;H production. Helmed by E&amp;H’s Takayuki Sano, it follows in the footsteps of the original in spirit and ideas and depict the world of Death Stranding through a bold and yet subtle touch and top-class hand-drawn animation. &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</em></p><p><em>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</em></p><p><em>And now, comes another explosion...&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> is the current working title, so the series' name could change, but when it premieres, it will do so on the Disney+ streaming service in 2027. <em>Isolations</em> is not to be confused with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/23/death-stranding-animated-film-announced"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a> (working title), which is an animated film set in the Death Stranding universe currently in the works, or <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/death-stranding-movie-lands-the-director-of-a-quiet-place-day-one">the live-action Death Stranding movie A24 is creating</a> with <em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>director Michael Sarnoski.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/boundless-sincerity-aside-flaws">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What kind of story do you hope Isolations tells?

            <p>A new trailer for Fallout Season 2 has been released, giving us a quick peak at what'll be going down in and around New Vegas. Moments of note include a fight with a Deathclaw, a glimpse of The Kings, and a close up of Macaulay Culkin.</p>
<p>A continuation of the incredibly popular first season, this time The Ghoul and Lucy Maclean follow Hank Maclean into the Nevada desert where they'll surely run into all manner of ne'er-do-wells. They're followed by Maxmimus of the Brotherhood of Steel, who'll have to wrestle with a giant monster, as well as his feelings. Which will prove harder? Who knows… Neato!</p>
<p>Macaulay Culkin is seen as a member of The Legion, seemingly stabbing some poor guy in a gruesome fashion. He doesn't seem to be having the worst time of it either, which makes sense considering what Fallout fans will already know about The Legion and how they get down. You can watch the trailer yourself, embedded below.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early-2000644001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early.1352683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a quality monitor usually means choosing between paying premium prices for trusted brands or gambling on unknown manufacturers that might deliver terrible color accuracy and dead pixels. LG stands as one of the most prestigious names in display technology and finding their products at bargain prices rarely happens outside of major sales events.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/">launched an early Black Friday deal that brings the LG 32UR500K-B down to $199, slashed from its usual $299</a>. This record-low pricing puts a<strong> 32-inch 4K UHD monitor</strong> from a reputable manufacturer at the same cost as generic no-name displays that flood the market with questionable quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Justifies the LG Name</h2>
<p>The <strong>32-inch 4K UHD display lets you experience 3840 by 2160 resolution</strong> that reproduces sharp text and detailed images across the whole screen. This kind of pixel density means you can see fine details in photos, read small text without zooming and enjoy crisp lines in spreadsheets or design work. The panel expresses up to <strong>90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut</strong> – that’s the cinema-grade color space used in professional content creation and high-end displays. You’re seeing colors that match what directors and designers intended rather than the washed-out or oversaturated visuals that come from cheaper monitors that have poor color reproduction.</p>



<p>HDR10 support elevates compatible content by expanding the range <strong>between darkest blacks and brightest whites</strong>. HDR takes advantage of the ability to create realistic lighting and shadow details in modern games, 4K video content, and streaming services that are impossible on flat SDR content. You’ll notice the dramatic visual immersion when watching HDR movies or playing supported games.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in stereo speakers</strong> with <em>Waves MaxxAudio</em> save desk space and eliminate the need for separate speakers if you’re using a minimalist setup. The audio quality is also quite a step above the tinny sound most monitor speakers produce; it’s big and bold, making movies and games actually enjoyable without headphones. For video calls or casual consumption of content, this solution works perfectly.</p>
<p><em>OnScreen Control</em> software gives quick access to monitor settings <strong>without having to fumble around with physical buttons</strong> on the back of the display. You are able to split your screen into different zones for multitasking, tune brightness and contrast with mouse clicks, and switch between preset modes optimized for different tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>ergonomic stand allows for tilt adjustment that lets you angle the screen to match your eye level and viewing position.</strong> Proper monitor positioning reduces neck strain during long sessions of work and prevents glare from overhead lights or windows. The borderless design maximizes screen real estate while creating a modern aesthetic that looks clean on any desk.</p>
<p>Multiple connectivity options include<strong> two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort</strong> for flexibility in hooking up gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops or media devices all at the same time. You can also easily switch inputs to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging cables, which is a plus if you use the monitor with multiple systems.</p>
<p>At $199, you’re paying what generic 32-inch 4K monitors cost while getting LG’s established reputation for reliability.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for its cosy Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, revealing new forms for series icons Pikachu and Snorlax.</p>
<p>Shown at the very end, Pikachu appears to be in ghost form, while Snorlax is made of stone with a flower on its head. Beyond outfits and Gigantamax variants, this is the first time either of these two Pokémon has had a new form.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these are Peakychu, a "pale Pikachu with drooping ears whose fur is a mysterious colour", and Mosslax, covered in moss of course. There's also a new Smeargle called Smearguru, who uses its tail as a brush.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the trailer goes into detail on Pokopia's life-sim gameplay that bears resemblance to both Animal Crossing and Minecraft.</p>
<p>You'll play as a Ditto who transforms into the image of a young girl, though the trailer later confirms you'll be able to customise the character to your liking.</p>
<p>Ditto is introduced to Professor Tangrowth, who appears as a sort of mentor figure. The professor explains the island used to be home to many humans, but now it's deserted. It's Ditto's job to regenerate the island, using the power of Pokémon of course.</p>

</figure>
<p>Firstly you'll need to create habitats to attract Pokémon to the island. That might be as simple as planting tall grass to attract the likes of Charmander, Timburr, or Eevee, while a punching bag will attract Hitmonchan, and a fishing rod will attract a Magikarp.</p><p>Ditto can then learn signature moves from Pokémon to further spruce up the island. Yes, you can learn Squirtles Water Gun move to vom up a load of water from Ditto's mouth to help plants grow. Other moves include Scyther's Cut and Bulbasaur's Vine Whip.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This looks questionable. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain Pokémon will also have special moves allowing Ditto to transform. Lapras, for instance, will allow Ditto to swim to new islands, or with Dragonite you can fly.</p>
<p>Ditto can then craft items at a workbench using materials found on the island, like logs and straw beds to make Pokémon more comfortable. And yes, Ditto appears to vomit these items up too.</p>
<p>Appeasing Pokémon requests provides mini quests too, and Ditto can also use the power of Pokémon to help out around the island - Pichu's electric abilities can light up lamps, for instance.</p>
<p>What's more, Pokopia can be played with up to four players co-operatively, and uses Game Share to share with friends without the game across either Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-spin-off-pokemon-pokopia-gets-release-date-but-its-another-controversial-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Pokémon Pokopia will be out on 5th March</a>, as revealed earlier this week. However, it will also be a Game-Key Card, Nintendo's controversial physical media.</p>

		<p>Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2 is kicking off with some new DLC on December 4th, with Stardock Entertainment announcing the Tales of the Terran Alliance content. This is just the first of five DLCs that will make up Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2, with more coming in 2026 and 2027. Those are Federations &amp; Empire and Ascension, both penned in for 2026, followed by Hegemon and Underworld which are both scheduled for 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="Galactic Civilizations IV - Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-JwUI8D5lU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“This expansion is a love letter to&nbsp;Galactic Civilizations&nbsp;fans who have been asking for deeper human lore,”</em> said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment.<em> “Tales of the Terran Alliance delivers not just new gameplay mechanics, but a rich narrative experience that explores what it means to be human in a galaxy full of ancient, powerful civilizations.”</em></p>
<p>The Tales of the Terran Alliance DLC will put players in humanity’s shoes as it looks at an era where the human race was expanding through space. In the DLC you will be playing as the Xendar, get access to a new human technology tree, experience new narrative events that shape the journey of humanity, and get new weapons, planetary improvements, defenses, and more ship components. This DLC pack will cost $14.99, though the Expansion Pack 2 will offer a discount on the total price of all five packs.</p>

			<p>While Elder Scrolls fans can rest easy in the knowledge that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> is the next major new release from Bethesda to come, Fallout fans are left wondering when the studio will ever get to Fallout 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">It might be greenlit</a>, but for now, the only new stories coming out of the Fallout universe <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">are from the Amazon TV show</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/">Fallout 76</a>, and mods like Fallout: London. What we do have to look forward to in the short term, however, are the reported remasters on the way, one for Fallout 3, and, according to a new claim, one for Fallout New Vegas.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, following an interview Todd Howard did with GQ Magazine to discuss the latest re-release of Fallout 4, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, it was claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Fallout 3 Remastered was in the works</a>, and would be a similar release to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>



<p>Now, this time from Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's claimed that a Fallout New Vegas Remastered is also on its way. Replying to a post on X (formerly Twitter) where a user is commenting on the Fallout 3 Remastered rumors and the fact that it's not New Vegas, Corden replied with a simple "<em>Dw, nv is coming too</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not the first time this year we've heard claims that a New Vegas Remaster is on the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">as a rumor popped up this past July</a> claiming that multiple Fallout projects, including remasters of New Vegas and Fallout 3, were on their way. It's also worth remembering that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">saw more than 9 million players flock to the new version</a> of Bethesda's classic, and has remained one of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmzub6k25">the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>.</p>



<p>Bethesda knows <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-spent-more-on-remakes-than-remasters-in-last-two-years-ampere-analysis/">there's money to be made in those remaster/remake hills</a>, and considering the fact that the popular Amazon TV series adaptation is taking its characters to New Vegas in the upcoming season two, the timing is perfect for Bethesda to kick off a slew of Fallout remasters.</p>



<p>So while you should still approach claims around these coming remasters with caution, since, technically, it's possible these remasters don't make it out the door, if you're wanting to revisit Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas in a new, Oblivion Remastered-style light, you can take comfort in the fact that there are a lot of signs pointing to both remasters happening, and hopefully, very soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty Lets You Manage Your Own Stable of Horses Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-lets-you-manage-your-own-stable-of-horses-next-year.1352641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Italian publishing house Leonardo Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>, an "open-world horse racing management game" that's set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will marry "adrenaline-fueled competition" with "the calming art of horse care", allowing you not only to hit the track but also to care for your horses while they're not racing.</p>

<p>Leonardo describes its game as "the first horse racing management game to feature realistic and scalable 3D graphics built in Unreal Engine", so you can perhaps expect a slightly higher degree of realism here than you might be used to from the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-management.jpg?itok=E0bZ_68k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-management.jpg?itok=Ke8hEzDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>looks like a pretty thorough horse racing management sim.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to, you can "directly control [your] horses in dynamic, real-time races", but if you prefer, you can also take a more strategic approach by "planning and managing races from above the track".</p>

<p>This being a horse racing management sim, you will, of course, be given control over pretty much every facet of your stable, including breeding, finances, training schedules, and facility upgrades.</p>

<p>It's all in service of simulating what Leonardo Interactive calls "a living, evolving world where every number and gene can make or break your success". The game will even let you take part in horse auctions, scout new horses for your stable, and "carefully plan your genetic bloodlines to breed the next generation of champions".</p>

<p>It wouldn't be much of a horse racing sim if you couldn't race on real tracks, of course, so&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will boast several licensed tracks "in stunning detail", including the likes of Ascot, Flemington, and Capannelle, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-horse-racing.jpg?itok=YmM81Ns3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-horse-racing.jpg?itok=sWU3fPUB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to take direct part in races or approach them more strategically in&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>, you'll be able to do so on "PC and consoles" in 2026. No more specific release date has been revealed, and we don't know exactly which consoles the game will appear on, either.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Steel Frontiers Is a Robo-Dino MMO from NCSoft]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-robo-dino-mmo-from-ncsoft.1352638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NCSoft and Sony have announced&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, an MMO spinoff of Guerrilla Games'&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series, and it'll offer a twist on the franchise's "signature hunting-action gameplay".</p>

<p>Since NCSoft is responsible for this game's development, it seems that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">reports of the project's cancellation</a> were greatly exaggerated (assuming this isn't a completely different Sony-NCSoft collaboration, that is), although it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

<p>When the game does launch, it'll arrive on PC and mobile devices, and it'll give you the chance to experience the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' robo-dino-hunting gameplay with your fellow hunters. Full crossplay will be supported as well, so you can play alongside your buddies on PC or mobile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=AXypeg7J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=0FuKtcfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a "hunting-action" MMO from Sony and NCSoft.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' iconic hunting gameplay, you can also look forward to "deeply customizable combat and extensive player freedom", so it sounds as though the open-world component of the games will be maintained as well.</p>

<p>New mechanical creatures and "large-scale battles" will also be introduced as part of the new MMO, and since it's almost certainly a live service-style game, it's likely it will be updated over time with new monsters and quests to tackle.</p>

<p><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is just one of the spinoff projects being made around Guerrilla's series; there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">live-action movie in development</a>, and as of late 2022, the studio was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">making a multiplayer spinoff</a> of its own (although it's possible&nbsp;<em>Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a reworked version of said project).</p>

<p>One project that certainly won't be taking its place alongside these spinoffs is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which is currently defending itself in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">copyright and trademark infringement court case</a> brought by Sony.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, but when it does arrive, it'll be available for PC, iOS, and Android. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
