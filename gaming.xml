            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/oneodio-studio-max-1-wireless-headphone-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>We’re always very keen on discovering the best ways to deliver sounds directly (and often quite loudly) into our ears. If we can do that for less than £200, that’s even better, and OneOdio have proven time and again that they’re capable of delivering top-end sound for less than their competitors. The <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Studio Max 1</a> ramps that up, with a package that offers an astounding amount of value.</p>
<p>The Studio Max 1 are a Hi-Res certified pair of headphones that are primarily aimed at the DJ and audiophile market, though they’ll suit anyone with a Nintendo Switch, PC or mobile device as well, so long as you work out if you’re going to get the best out of them.</p>
<p>If we were rating tech on the number of things in the box, the Studio Max 1 would push itself to the top of the pile the moment we opened the voluminous packaging. You’ve got the headphones themselves, USB-A to USB-C charging cable, fabric carry bag, a 3.5mm to ¼” jack cable, a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable and a further ¼” adaptor. Besides that, there’s the M1 transmitter, which allows Hi-Res wireless connections, from the source of your choice.</p>



<p>Clad all in black, with bright red speaker covers, the Studio Max 1 are a relatively unassuming pair of headphones. The gloss finish, and vinyl-like design of the OneOdio logo on each earpiece is attractive without calling for too much attention, but the plastics used are a little too light and feel cheaper than I’d expect for the price. The headband is topped by a piece of leatherette embossed with the OneOdio brand, alongside red stitching that adds a touch of visual interest.</p>

<p>The joints between the headband and earpieces once again look and feel cheaper, and though I had no problems during testing, I do wonder just how much punishment they’ll put up with over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Comfort levels are very good here, with plush leatherette ear cushions and a memory foam headband cushion that’s just the right thickness to protect your head through long listening stints. I happily wore them for hours, and didn’t suffer from any fatigue around my ears or on my temple, which is exactly what you want from a headset that boasts a ridiculous 120-hour battery life.</p>
<p>So, the OneOdio Studio Max 1 can connect wirelessly with the M1 transmitter or via Bluetooth, or just be wired up, each of which has specific use cases. The M1 transmitter takes a USB or analogue input and then uses a proprietary RAPID WILL+ connection (Rapid Wireless Low Latency Link) to the headphones that aims for a mere 20ms of latency, when compared to even the fastest Bluetooth codecs. It has all the appearance of a USB powerbank, because it almost could be; the transmitter has a battery built in that can last up to 60 hours.</p>

<p>Of course, the only way to get the best out of the Studio Max 1 is with a library of high-resolution music or a Hi-Res streaming service. All three inputs are capable of Hi-Res playback, but Bluetooth depends on if your device is capable of LDAC. If you’re on iPhone or Nintendo Switch it’s only going to use the standard AAC or SBC codec, which isn’t the best way to experience these headphones.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps little surprise to find that the best connection to be had here is wired. The level of detail is frankly astounding, and using the first of my test tracks Billie Eilish’ ‘No Time To Die’, the Studio Max 1 delivered on all of its technical promises. Billie’s reverb-heavy vocals are joyously crisp, while the swells of orchestration felt powerful and overwhelming, without a hint of bloat or distortion and good separation between the different instrumentation.</p>
<p>The second-best connection is via the M1 transmitter, its multiple inputs and built-in battery making it suitable for turning any wired music session wireless, and with its low latency codec ensuring that you’re as close to the music or action as possible.</p>
<p>The LDAC Bluetooth connection stands as the third best option, as there was a harsher edge here with my other test track, Papa Roach’s ‘Even if It Kills Me’, that wasn’t present via the other two. That’s not to say that it was a bad effort, but compared to my faithful Sony XM5s, the audio lacked the same level of depth or sparkle.</p>

<p>Switching between the wired connections is simple enough, but at various points I struggled to reconnect to the M1 transmitter after being in Bluetooth mode. It’s supposed to automatically connect, and while it seemed to think it had, no audio was passed through. I had to resort to re-pairing the two each time, which was annoying, but not a total deal-breaker.</p>
<p>OneOdio have tuned the Studio Max 1 for reference as opposed to emphasising any particular element of the audio, and it feels like a true representation of the original production which should please producers and aficionados alike. Some listeners may be looking for a more lively response though, and while you can EQ some extra heft or thump to the bottom end, it isn’t the Studio Max 1’s primary use case.</p>
<p>My two favourite cost-effective Hi-Res certified wired headphones remain the Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7 and Philips Fidelio, and though they lose out to the OneOdio on the alternate connection types, they’re still the ones I’d reach for if I was going to indulge in a wired listening session. That said, the OneOdio can fit into your life in a far more complete manner, and will sound great while doing so.</p>
<p><em>The OneOdio Studio Max 1 is available now from <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Amazon</a> (15% discount: CJHVATYN) and direct from the <a href="https://bit.ly/42ribFc">OneOdio website</a> (15% discount: STM1social)</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-only-the-%E2%80%98first-half%E2%80%99-of-the-game.1157979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-first-half/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The reviews for the second season of The Last of Us are rolling out right now, and they’re mostly positive, bar a few outliers. This batch of all-new episodes has been a long time coming, given that it has been more than two years since the first season dropped and turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>The award-winning show returns to the pleasure of fans everywhere, and if there’s one thing the reviews are confirming, it’s how much meat is on the bones of the second season. The earlier reports are being confirmed – The Last of Us season two only represents the first half of the 2020 release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-makes-sense">Makes Sense</h2>



<p>We always knew The Last of Us Part II would be a beast to adapt for a live-action series. It’s an expansive title that spans years and several settings – plus there are two playable characters who each have their perspective on the game’s intense and cinematic story.</p>



<p>It was suggested a while ago by showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann that it would take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-tv-show-around-forever/">‘two or three seasons’</a> to cover everything in The Last of Us Part II, and that’s not including original content that’s created specifically for the show.</p>



<p>The reviews that are emerging now have confirmed that around <strong>one-half </strong>of The Last of Us Part II is covered by the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-and-episode-count-revealed/">batch of seven episodes</a>. Some have complained that it feels ‘spread thin’ when compared to the first season, which saw the entirety of the game covered by a single sprint.</p>



<p>This likely means that setting up the climax for a painful transition into the third season, which will likely take another two or three years, will be front and centre as the episodes unravel.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two is set to release with a schedule of one episode a week starting this Sunday, April 13.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-exclusive-disney-illusion-island-coming-to-ps5-it%E2%80%99s-revealed.1157973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/disney-illusion-island-coming-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2023, Disney Illusion Island was released exclusively on Nintendo Switch. It wasn’t a groundbreaking title, but it boasted a charming enough 2D side-scrolling operating model that allowed players to control some of Disney’s most beloved characters.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed by dataminers that after almost two years on the market, Disney Illusion Island is leaving the Nintendo Switch and heading to PlayStation 5. It hasn’t been confirmed if it’ll be launching on Xbox and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-disney">More Disney </h2>



<p>In a listing posted on <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2956512/disney-illusion-island-starring-mickey-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSDeals.net</a>, it was revealed that ‘Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends’ is headed to PlayStation 5 (digitally) on May 30. This information was first uncovered by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lmbnmasc7k2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> on social media.</p>



<p>In Illusion Island, players can pick from Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, or Goofy, taking those characters and navigating through perilous levels and avoiding enemy attacks to resolve quests. As the game unravels, players unlock more abilities and broader areas of the map.</p>



<p>From the game’s description from the PS Store scraping:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to explore the mysterious island of Monoth and recover three mystical books to save the world from disaster!</p>



<p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends includes the base game plus the Keeper Up, Mystery in Monoth, and brand new C.A.S.H. update featuring Scrooge McDuck.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a game with local co-op mechanics, so it’s perfect for families. It hasn’t been suggested how much it’ll cost, but it’s $39.99 in the Nintendo Store, so use that as a guide.</p>



<p>The game was developed by Dlala Studios, and it was noted that the title took inspiration from Rayman Legends when it was being created. On launch, the game garnered mixed reviews, going on to land a Metacritic score of 73 but securing some high praise from Nintendo-centric outlets.</p>



<p>For instance, while IGN gave Illusion Island a score of 7/10, Nintendo Life reached for a score of 9/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-explain-why-solid-snake-silent-tough-guy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima created and released Metal Gear in 1987, introducing Solid Snake to the world. He would go on to become one of the most widely recognised characters in gaming, but his first outing rendered him a silent, stalwart figure incapable of uttering a single word.</p>



<p>Kojima has gone on record explaining why Solid Snake was silent, breaking down his earliest experiences with voice actors and reflecting on past technologies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-still-couldn-t-speak">‘Games Still Couldn’t Speak’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/49804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An An</a> (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima explained at length why Solid Snake was a silent protagonist in the first Metal Gear game that debuted in the late eighties:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 1986, when I entered the game industry, <strong>games still couldn’t speak</strong>. The characters didn’t have voices. There wasn’t even a kanji font, and the characters were just displayed one by one. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut game, Metal Gear (1987), was born as <strong>a silent tough guy</strong> because of this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It didn’t take long for things to change, though. The legendary developer revealed that just one year after Metal Gear was released, a technological leap forward occurred when NEC released the CD-ROM2, a console with a disc drive. This was an evolution that accommodated Kojima’s desires:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the media was CD, it was possible to use voice dialogue, which had not been possible until then. I was one of the first to step forward and remake it.</p>



<p>It was my first time doing voice recordings. I did the casting myself, but since I was a complete outsider, I left the management to an agency. I took the first bullet train from Kobe and arrived at the studio in Tokyo. The gorgeous voice actors were already standing by in front of the microphone. </p>



<p>There was no time to greet or even have a meeting. It was an outrageous schedule, with everything recorded in almost half a day. There was no way I could build relationships. The regret and regret of this first experience would greatly change my subsequent voice recordings.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Text translated from Japanese by AI)</em></p>



<p>From there, history started being made, and Kojima went on to explain how his various teams tried to innovate in the voice recording department whenever possible. Today, Kojima’s games feature Hollywood celebrities and deeply cinematic scripts and performances, so it’s fair to say he was successful in that mission.</p>

			<p>How do you follow up on the most successful racing game of all time? Between the Wii U and Switch versions of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8</a> has sold over 75 million copies, delivering consistent chart-topping performance for over a decade. Nintendo is certainly hoping their long-awaited follow-up, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, will get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> off to a speedy start, but the game has some big tires to fill.</p>
<p>Does Mario Kart World have a chance of matching up to the Mario Kart 8 behemoth? I recently had the chance to go hands-on with Mario Kart World at a Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are my general thoughts on the new hardware</a>) and you can drift on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>During the Switch 2 preview event, journalists initially had the chance to go hands-on with Mario Kart World’s traditional Grand Prix races, then later could come back to try the new Knockout Mode, in which a field of players race through six interconnected courses in hopes of being the last one standing. Admittedly, my reaction after playing through a handful of Grand Prix Cups was somewhat muted. This was partly due to the fact that Nintendo had set these introductory Grand Prix races to 50cc, so they felt quite pokey, but the action itself was also very familiar.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8’s anti-gravity gimmick, in which karts could cling to surfaces and course designs were often mind-bending knots, seems to have been largely removed, but many courses still have elevated sections that provide a similar experience. Even without the anti-gravity mechanic, Mario Kart World feels very similar to MK8 in terms of controls, track design, and the way you interact with other racers. Of course, that’s not a <em>bad </em>thing, Mario Kart 8 is a great game, but the feeling of “newness” I was hoping for from MK World wasn’t necessarily coming through during my early minutes with the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Granted, Mario Kart World does offer some core gameplay differences. The field of racers has doubled in size to 24, which doesn’t change the feel of the action <em>that</em> much, although there can be times when things get frantic on a level not seen before. And yes, that means you’re going to be on the receiving end of more items than ever, which may not be great news depending on your personal Mario Kart tastes (I think items are half the fun). On that topic, there are some new items, including some useful seeming ones like the new Gold Shell that leaves behind a trail of coins, as well as a few somewhat odd additions, like food items that mainly serve to change the costume your character is wearing (<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, playing dress-up seems to be a big focus of MK World).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Players can now also grind on rails and wall jump, although I didn’t encounter a ton of chances to utilize those skills during my hands-on time (admittedly, my eyes probably just weren’t trained to look for those opportunities yet). One of the things that stood out most to me, was that karts no longer plunge into the deep when encountering water, but instead bob along the surface with some decent water effects and physics being on display. It seems like Nintendo may have added a touch of Wave Race to Mario Kart World, in much the same way they mixed a sprinkle of F-Zero seasoning into Mario Kart 8.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s changed is the way Grand Prix Cups progress. Rather than the usual four races of three laps each, you now start with a standard three-lap race, then drive to the three subsequent races, passing through “intermission” transitional courses before taking on a single lap of the next main course. It’s all a bit confusing at first, but you’ll catch on soon enough, and the new approach could result in a much wider array of Gran Prix layouts. While Nintendo hasn't revealed anything like this yet, I could envision a mode where players are given the option to plot out their own Grand Prix Cups.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World’s course design is a mix of old and new, with classics like the SNES’ Koopa Troopa Beach and the N64’s Choco Mountain interspersed with new creations like the dusty desert Mario Bros. Circuit, animal-filled Faraway Oasis, and odd mashup of classic Donkey Kong girders and rocket launch site that is DK Spaceport. Many of the older tracks have been altered in fairly significant ways in order to fit into the game’s new interconnected world, but it's a bit of a double-edged sword. There's a certain consistency between many courses enforced by the connected world, and while I didn’t encounter any bad tracks, some blend into each other a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World looks fairly nice visually, with characters having a new level of pop and personality, although it would be a stretch to say the game looks <em>that</em> much better than Mario Kart 8 (to be fair, that game still looks great a decade on). Even with double the mayhem on screen, the game maintained a silky smooth 60fps and, apparently, there will even be a 120fps mode in the full game, which I would’ve loved to try.</p>
<p>At this point in my impressions, perhaps you have the sense that, while I had fun with Mario Kart World, I wasn’t completely blown away by the experience. In fact, that was more or less the case after I finished playing Grand Prix. Thankfully, after returning to play several rounds of Knockout Mode, I think I began to see more clearly what Nintendo is attempting to do with Mario Kart World and my feelings about the game improved considerably.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Knockout Mode is essentially Mario Kart Battle Royale, with players racing through six seamlessly connected courses, with the bottom four racers being eliminated each time you pass a finish line. The goal is to be one of the last four standing and ultimately win that final race. The Knockout demo was thankfully played on 100cc, and battling with 24 other human players, with your position in the race always being important, delivered a level of intensity rarely seen in past Mario Kart games. The smooth transition from one single-lap race to the next also brought the interconnectedness of the world to the forefront.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of which, while waiting for other players to connect to Knockout Mode, I got to try out Free Roam, which gave me a greater appreciation of what Nintendo has achieved with Mario Kart World’s map. While you can fully explore the nooks and crannies of whatever course you start on, if you continue driving, you’ll seamlessly transition from one course and biome to the next. During one Free Roam session I started in the icy tundra, transitioned to a jungle area, and eventually wound up in Bowser’s volcanic domain. There wasn’t actually a lot to <em>do </em>while driving around, but hopefully Nintendo reveals more Free Roam activities. Regardless, it’s genuinely impressive how everything ties together.</p>
<p>Knockout Mode and Free Roam are experiences you simply can’t have in Mario Kart 8. Are they inspiring enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justify Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</a>? That remains to be seen, but I’m excited to see what other things Nintendo might do with their new asphalt amusement park both now and in the future.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Mario Kart World</strong></h2>
<p>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

Reverent Seers use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class with support capabilities. Rune Pillars are their signature mechanic. They can summon supportive runes for healing, shielding, and <a title="Genres > Stealth [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>. They also have offensive runes that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies, shifting the course of battle. A well-timed death prevention spell can turn the tide in an instant.</li></ul></li><li><strong>New Scenes and Areas</strong><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Mistchasers, a vast new region north of Brandrgarde has been uncovered. The Ember Iris, which flourishes in abundance, is the signature feature of <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a> Iris. However, the mysterious ancient arrays and seal gates are what truly capture the Gylden Hunters’ attention. The Forge, where <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to artisans and laborers who have become the Corroded, alongside its eternally burning furnace fires.</li><li>With the addition of new areas, Brandrgarde has become too large, so we’ve split the entire fortress into two maps. Each time you explore, you’ll be placed in one of these maps at random.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Solo Mode</strong> – Solo mode shares the same maps as trio mode, but we’ve redesigned monster placement for a smoother experience. Balancing classes for solo play is particularly challenging, and we welcome your feedback during testing.</li><li><strong>New Monsters</strong> – This test introduces several new monsters, including the Warden, Prison Guard, Nightwatcher, and Penitent. We’ve also completed the second phase of Otto, the Flesheater. Good luck taking them on! Additionally, if you’re lucky enough to find a Dried Flower Knot while exploring the fortress, you can unlock the Einherjar mode challenge against Otto, the Flesheater. This mode offers better rewards, but we strongly advise Gylden Hunters to prepare well in advance.</li><li><strong>Camp</strong> – Although the camp scene and its NPCs are not yet complete, we are moving forward with testing the camp system first. Using various resources gathered during your Brandrgarde explorations, you can upgrade different features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, expanded Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. Additionally, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage, making it easier for Gylden Hunters to experience multiple classes.</li><li><strong>Optimizations and Adjustments</strong><ul><li><strong>Class Balance</strong><ul><li>To address the disadvantages of melee classes in PvE, we’ve added extra PvE damage bonus/damage reduction attributes for melee classes. We’ve also improved overall dodge performance and reduced performance differences caused by dodge animation variations across classes.</li><li>Next week, we’ll publish a separate detailed announcement regarding class balance changes for PvP. Some classes and builds will be buffed with new abilities, while certain overpowered skills and traits will be specifically nerfed. As always, we’ll continue making swift balance adjustments based on your feedback throughout this test.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Progression Adjustments</strong><ul><li>This test will introduce legendary accessories, providing higher equipment progression goals. As we’re currently developing female character models for all classes, the tight 3D pipeline schedule has delayed the completion of the other legendary equipment. We’ll complete the female character models and remaining legendary equipment as soon as possible.</li><li>We’ve removed fixed affixes from some equipment and expanded the variety of available randomly generated affixes. Equipment now has a chance to spawn with affixes higher than Lv. 1, offering more powerful rare equipment and allowing for more complex build customization.</li><li>We’ve also removed attribute growth from level progression to reduce the imbalance created by large attribute gaps between new and veteran players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core Quality Improvements</strong><ul><li>We’ve optimized input buffering overall, added support for multi-directional dodging, and fixed issues that led to damage loss and animation hitching. We’ve also enhanced basic character models, improved basic animations, such as walking and running, optimized lighting effects in certain scenes, and increased texture resolution in some areas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performance Optimizations</strong><ul><li>The minimum supported graphics card requirements have been lowered to: NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, with plans to expand device support for additional devices in the future. We’ve also focused on optimizing issues like crashes from memory leaks and frame rate instability under certain conditions. This test will introduce FSR functionality (FSR Super Resolution is available only for graphics cards that don’t support DLSS Super Resolution, while FSR Frame Generation can be enabled on any graphics card).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Team <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Improvements</strong><ul><li>Added a Friends system and completed the formal team-up feature. You can now invite friends to explore Brandrgarde together at any time.</li><li>Added the Fill Team feature—when challenging trio mode with this option enabled, the system will first assemble a full three-player team for you before entering combat.</li><li>Added real-time voice chat for teams, allowing Gylden Hunters to communicate during gameplay.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Localization Support</strong><ul><li>This test will add localization support for Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese. Additional languages will be added gradually in the future.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Others</strong><ul><li>Added an execution mechanic in trio mode, allowing players to quickly finish off downed enemies.</li><li>Added an in-game emote system, with eight emotes currently available.</li><li>Added the Journey system—complete challenges to earn rewards that will aid in your Gylden Hunt.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Mistfall Hunter</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Beta 2 Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Mistfall Hunter - BETA 2 Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEhuO0P923Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>

To celebrate this feat, EA Sports released a video congratulating Ovechkin and offering in-game rewards in NHL 25.</p>

<p>Starting today, players can log into Hockey Ultimate Team to receive a Milestones Ovechkin item. Ovechkin HUT Moments challenges will grant tokens to upgrade the item. Additionally, EA Sports is adding an "895 Ovechkin" HUT item that features special art and a 99 overall rating. Finally, NHL 25 is adding a commemorative "895" jersey in World of Chel and making it available to all players.</p>

</article><p>Alexander Ovechkin first appeared in an EA Sports NHL game in 2006 with NHL 07, where he also served as the cover athlete. Since then, he has appeared in every entry and was the cover athlete of NHL 21 and NHL 94 Rewind, making him one of only three players to be featured on the cover of EA Sports' NHL franchise multiple times. He was also the cover athlete of NHL 2K10 in the now-defunct NHL 2K series.</p>



<p>Alexander Ovechkin was selected first overall by the Washington Capitals in 2004. However, due to the 2004/2005 NHL lockout, Ovechkin didn't make his NHL debut until 2005. In the time since, Ovechkin has been elected to 13 All-Star teams, was named an All-Decade First-Team member for both the 2000s and 2010s, and won the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year in 2006, as well as three Hart Memorial Trophies for Most Valuable Player. In 2018, Ovechkin led the Capitals to the franchise's first and only Stanley Cup, where he also took home the Conn Smythe Trophy for the Stanley Cup Final's Most Valuable Player.</p>

<p>NHL 25 arrived on October 4, 2024, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

The date was revealed via a community ARG campaign that saw thousands of fans decipher a series of fragmented codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gameplay reveal presentation airs this Saturday, April 12, starting at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. It will be broadcast on Bungie’s Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok accounts.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>First </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon"><span><span><span><span>announced</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> in 2023, this reimagining of the original Marathon series, one of Bungie’s earliest shooter franchises from the ‘90s, puts players in the roles of cybernetic mercenaries called Runners. The game unfolds in a lost colony on the dangerous planet Tau Ceti IV, and Runners are specially designed to survive the world’s harsh conditions and search for lost artifacts and other treasures.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>That premise translates to team-based matches where players must work together to salvage and extract the most loot (such as weapons and gear) while preventing the opposing team from doing so. Bungie hasn’t divulged many more details up to this point, so we expect Saturday’s showcase to provide a deeper dive into everything Marathon offers.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Marathon has no release window but will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at launch.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Blue Prince Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-prince-review.1157868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not entirely convinced Dogubomb didn’t develop Blue Prince as a personal gift to me, specifically. This exceedingly clever puzzler mixes together a shortlist of my top game genres and concepts: First-person puzzling with a straightforward facade that hides a seemingly bottomless pit of secrets, roguelite runs that perfectly balance permanent improvements with the growth of your own skills, drafting mechanics that capitalize on the best parts of deckbuilders without the baggage that comes with actually being one, and even tile-based map building reminiscent of my favorite board game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Carcassone</u></a>. Even if there are things in that pile of Tom Stuff that don’t excite you as much as they do me, the combination comes together <em>beautifully</em>. I’m still rabidly peeling back the layers of this onion after dozens of hours, but I’m already certain Blue Prince has secured its place as an all-time puzzle great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Simon, a teenage boy who has inherited the stately mansion of his well-respected and somewhat eccentric great uncle, but may only claim that inheritance if he can figure out how to navigate the ever-shifting halls of the estate in order to find a hidden 46th room. It’s a fairly simple setup at the start (apart from the whole M.C. Escher shifting house thing), and while there are plenty of helpful tips scattered around for you to find, you are largely just set loose to see what you can piece together for yourself. It’s a great foundation, because while you don’t always know what the next step may be, your goals <em>are </em>always clear enough that I never felt like I was just wandering around in the dark.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tom's Top 10 First-Person Puzzle Games</h3><p>My favorite first-person puzzle games!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably <em>will </em>feel like you are wandering around in circles from time to time, though. The meat of Blue Prince is the drafting mechanic you use to explore the house: You start each day with a limited number of “steps” that are spent whenever you go through a door, and each time you open a new one you are given three options for which of the mansion’s many unique rooms will be on the other side. That means you are filling out the nine-by-five room floorplan differently every single time, connecting doorways and trying not to hit dead ends as you find helpful items and invaluable clues along the way. It may sound like nothing too outside the box, but it’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over this system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some rooms are just simple hallways, while others play more varied roles that are split into colored categories based on type. For example, purple bedrooms often give you additional steps when entered, yellow shops can sell helpful items if you’ve picked up enough coins to buy them, and red rooms have negative effects (like obscuring your draft options) that could throw a wrench in your plans. Certain rooms may only appear when specific conditions are met, too, such as when you are drafting on the edges of the house or once you get deep enough in. It was fun to figure out which should be my go-to rooms early on in order to set myself up for success later, gathering items like keys to unlock doors or gems that can be spent to draft special rooms, and then using that prep work to make targeted dives toward a room or lead I was eager to hunt down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over the drafting system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual “puzzles” take on a variety of different forms within those rooms, but all of them are as entertaining as they are devilish to solve. Some have very straightforward math or logic problems, there are a few literal puzzle boxes to find, and others require a slightly more complicated combination of button pushes or lever pulls to solve whatever that room is doing. But fully self-contained challenges like that are side dishes to what Blue Prince truly has to offer, and the most interesting stuff feels closer to incredible first-person puzzle games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/22/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review"><u>Return of the Obra Dinn</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/outer-wilds-review"><u>Outer Wilds</u></a>. It asks you to really look at the world around you, take notes on what you find, and then use that knowledge to make connections where you can – and it does so in that expert way where something can feel completely cryptic at the outset and then brilliantly achievable when you finally crack it. That might mean looking through documents to find the combination to a safe, decoding why certain objects are where they are, or using the function of a specific room to get past an obstacle somewhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That last part can lead to the only real point of frustration I found with Blue Prince, however, which is that the best-laid floorplans of house mice and men can come crashing down with a few bad draws. Don’t get me wrong, there are very real and effective ways to help mitigate the randomness of which rooms are offered to you – both in terms of learning what to prioritize and when you should or shouldn’t take risks, as well as in permanent upgrades I won’t spoil that can make future runs more consistent. But, plain and simple, sometimes you will need a room that lets you turn left, do everything in your power to set yourself up to get it (including collecting dice that let you reroll the rooms you draw), and still be as stuck as Zoolander when you’re ultimately given your options. Those bad breaks are infrequent, but it still stings when an otherwise-good run ends because you just never saw the room you were looking for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Tangentially, I also <em>really</em> wish you could save and quit mid-run without having to cut your progress short by ending your current day entirely, or at the very least that opening the menu stopped the in-game clock from ticking. Runs can often stretch over an hour, which makes dipping in and out of Blue Prince a hard proposition – though this is only really a problem since I was playing on a desktop PC, as consoles and even the Steam Deck would let you suspend it if you need to go do something else.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There is <em>so much</em> to discover that any given run is rarely a waste of time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, any pain from that randomness is mitigated by the fact that there is just <em>so much</em> to discover here that a given run is rarely a waste of time. You may not have been able to draft that specific combination of rooms you were after or reach that certain square you wanted to, but odds are you still entered some new rooms along the way, and doing so almost always added to the growing list of mysteries I have jotted down across a pile of handwritten notes. “Beating” Blue Prince took me about 15 hours, and getting to that 46th room is absolutely a satisfying puzzle to solve on its own, but I also have far more goals now than I did when I first set out. There are safes to open, doors to unlock, books and letters to read, clues to decipher, and <em>loads</em> of lore to uncover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impressive how all of these optional puzzles are woven into and around the path of the “main” one – some are hiding in plain sight from the first minute, just waiting for you to realize they are important, while others drop an unassuming string of crumbs in your way that lead down a deep and unexpected rabbit hole when followed. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Prince Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Prince was an incredibly difficult game to talk about with friends who were also playing because the randomness of the drafting mechanic, combined with your own personal sense of curiosity, can send two players down very different paths. One time when I was around five hours in, I excitedly mentioned I’d unlocked something to a friend who had already played 40, only to learn they hadn’t even found that thing yet. And yet, this fractal abode doesn’t frustrate by randomly withholding things either, because clues can often be found in multiple forms or places; Once again, you’re always making progress toward <em>something</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you do get deeper, Blue Prince’s initially light-touch story also begins to shift more directly into the spotlight. Discovering more about both your character’s great uncle and the larger history of their family starts off as a little fun set dressing, but it eventually becomes as rich and compelling a reason to keep playing as any puzzle. The worldbuilding here is doled out with a patience I’m not used to seeing, with tons to learn about your relatives, the manor, and the nation it’s located in, but none of that is ever forced down your throat. That made anything I could glean about important historical events or complex geopolitics feel like a win that would almost always help me solve future mysteries, not just some “lore” to read about in books or letters and then move on from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still avoiding spoilers like laser tripwires in a Mission Impossible trap, that story and its themes smartly tie into your actions in a way few games are able to pull off so successfully. Piecing together the messy history of an extended and sometimes estranged family is rarely a linear process - Simon wanders through the house he has suddenly inherited finding bits of information told from conflicting points of view, and often in the entirely wrong order. Trying to make all of the right connections as he goes from a boy simply solving a fun puzzle so he can win a prize to one who understands the real reward this mansion holds reflected my own journey with Blue Prince, which is the sort of subtle brilliance you don’t see in many games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Blue Prince is the kind of puzzle game that dug deep into my brain and didn’t let go. Its complex mysteries weave brilliantly into the careful decision making of how to lay out the mansion’s rooms on each randomized run, leaving me building floorplans in my sleep almost every night after I played it. The story that slowly emerges within this fascinating place is also a compelling one, and it had me hungrily hunting for clues and combinations for many hours after I reached the credits while also poetically tying into the mechanics that lead you to them. Hitting a dead end you did everything in your power to avoid can frustrate from time to time, but this sprawling estate has so much to uncover that the randomness never stalled my progress for too long. If The Witness, Portal, and Myst are already emblazoned on the Mount Rushmore of first-person puzzle games, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Blue Prince carved alongside them soon enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Reviewer Mark Delany praises the first batch of episodes as a worthy follow-up to Season 1 and a great adaptation of the video game, saying, "Like its first season, The Last of Us Season 2 is a heart-wrenching examination of the ever-shifting distance between right and wrong, and as a whole, it's well on its way to becoming the best video game adaptation there is."</p><p>Though you’re cutting it close for a rewatch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSGGQXLG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Season 1 4K Steelbook</a> is currently on sale for $40.79 (was $50.55).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re a few years into a supposed artificial intelligence revolution, which could and should have been about reducing mundane tasks and freeing everyone up to do more interesting things with their time. Instead, thanks to the bloodthirsty nature of modern capitalism and an ideological crusade being waged by the tech industry, we’re now facing a world where many people’s livelihoods–like video game developers–are under direct threat.</p><p>These tumultuous times are of course being reported on everywhere you look, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including on this very website</a>, but one area I’ve been curious about recently aren’t the broader moral and legal battles, but what the struggle looks like for the average dev who is now having to encounter AI in their workplace.</p><p>For this piece, I spoke with a number of people working in the video game industry or very close to it, including artists, game designers, and software developers. I asked them to tell their stories about their daily interactions and struggles with&nbsp;artificial intelligence in the workplace, and what it means for the jobs they've been trained and hired to do.</p><p>Each person’s name and workplace has been changed to protect their identity.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[He] can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bradley </strong>is a veteran artist who works at a AAA video game studio. They describe the company as having been founded relatively recently, with investment coming from traditional AAA executives who “want to make money, and they are trying to figure out what game to make for that”.&nbsp;</p><p>They say their project’s art direction has been largely fuelled by AI prompts and generated imagery, all driven by their head Art Director, who is himself an experienced video game artist, but who now “can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT”.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my interview with the company I was very clear that I do not like AI-generated content”, Bradley says, and adds that the team initially said that was fine, the tech was only being used for pitching purposes. But Bradley says the reality has proven vastly different, and that the studio has made increasing use of AI-generated imagery in their team's art pipeline.</p><p>“I have no idea how he ended up as an art director when he can’t visualise what he wants in his head unless can see some end results”, Bradley says. Rather than beginning with sketches and ideas, then iterating on those to produce a more finalised image or vision, Bradley says his boss will just keep prompting an AI for images until he finds one he likes, and then the art team will have to backwards engineer the whole thing to make it work.</p><p>“He doesn't know that the important thing isn't just the end result, it's the journey and the questions you answer along the way”. Bradley says that the studio’s management have become so enamoured with the technology that without a reliance on AI-generated imagery for presentations and pitches they would not be at the stage they are now, which is dealing with publishers and investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley says they’ve threatened to quit if further attempts are made to use AI in the art pipeline. While the art team continues to resist the use of AI in creating actual concept pieces and assets for the game, it’s a different story when it comes to pitching the project to those publishers and investors.</p><p>“They’re finding it difficult to get funding because the game is being treated as a car salesman’s pitch, using AI-generated imagery to sell it without any actual substance or meat to back the vision up. The whole game is resting on a prompt ‘what if a game was…’, but with no idea if that would be fun, or how to make it fun. It’s madness”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Mitch </strong>has been working in software for over seven years. Having previously been employed in the defense industry, their last job was writing developer tools for a small tech startup creating an app. The company was built with some initial interest in artificial intelligence, though Mitch says this was met with “varying levels of scepticism” by employees.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was the most opposed”, Mitch says, “to the point where I felt it was a detriment. One team member who only ended up working there for a few months was very positive on it. The CEO was sceptical but felt like it could be a massive benefit if used correctly, and the other team members saw it as a fun toy that could occasionally be useful. So it was pretty broad across the board”.</p><p>Some at the company were uneasy with the technology early on, when the team initially had just a small AI plugin through which users could chat with the app. “On the way to the airport with a co-worker we talked about the introduction of these AI-generated plugins”, Mitch says. “Both of us felt incredibly uneasy with them. Despite [my coworker] finding AI to be a fun toy, he was worried that it wasn't what he had initially signed up for, and I had more or less the same sentiment. It didn't really boil over into anything at this point since the feature didn't go anywhere, but it was still notable”.</p><p>A few months later, things started to change. Mitch says the first signs of a deepening reliance on AI came when the company’s CEO was found to be rewriting parts of their app so that it would be easier for AI models to understand and help with. “Then”, Mitch says, “I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that”.</p><p>“Anyway, he told me that I would need to start using Chat GPT to speed up my development process. Furthermore, he said I should start using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claude</a>, another AI tool, to just wholesale create new features for the app. He walked me through setting up the accounts and had me write one with Claude while I was on call with him. I’m still not entirely sure why he did that, but I think it may have been him trying to convince himself that it would work.”</p><p>Mitch describes this increasing reliance on AI to be not just “incredibly boring”, but ultimately pointless. “Sure, it was faster, but it had a completely different development rhythm”, they say. “In terms of software quality, I would say the code created by the AI was worse than code written by a human–though not drastically so–and was difficult to work with since most of it hadn’t been written by the people whose job it was to oversee it”.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing to note is that just the thought of using AI to generate code was so demotivating that I think it would counteract any of the speed gains that the tool would provide, and on top of that would produce worse code than I didn’t understand. And that’s not even mentioning the ethical concerns of a tool built on plagiarism.”</p><p>Mitch says that over the 18 months they worked with the company, its CEO had transformed from someone mildly positive about AI to emphasising to workers that “AI was the future”. “In particular, he was of the belief that developers who are able to use AI to accelerate their process are going to win out in the future. I have seen this sentiment in other places worded as ‘an AI won't replace you, but a programmer who knows how to use AI will’. He didn’t believe that 18 months ago, but he absolutely believes it now”.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI’s poor code and a personal dislike of the technology meant that Mitch soon simply began ignoring their CEO’s instructions to use Chat GPT and Claude. A few months later, the entire company went bust. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Francis </strong>is both a consultant and artist in the video game industry, and so has worked alongside art teams as well as working with agencies, studios and publishers about their creative processes. “This means I have had some truly wild conversations about AI in a professional context that make me want to walk into the sea”, they say.</p><p>Since AI-generated imagery first blew up a few years ago, Francis has found that discussions both with consulting clients and potential employers for their own art has “shifted”. They believe that most employers and outsiders they speak to don’t see themselves as part of what Francis calls an ‘AI will replace artists!’ crowd, but are more like a ‘if we use AI it’ll make an artist’s life easier’ crowd, who think using AI in art will protect their artists, not displace them.</p><p>“What follows from these discussions is me explaining why, usually over hours rather than minutes, that these tools have no place in a professional game development pipeline or production and actually hinder the development of visuals”, Francis says. “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”</p><p>“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”</p><p>This all sounds <em>slightly </em>more optimistic than what other people I spoke with expressed, but Francis also added that a close family member is “neck-deep in the technology side of the AI industry”, and that “while conversation with them mostly gives me the desire to purchase cigarettes for the first time in a very long time, it also gives me insight into how these people feel when they say they are 'helping' my industry and 'innovating' to make artists' lives better.”</p><p>Francis says their understanding of the AI-pusher’s outlook is that they see the entire game-making process as a problem, one that AI tech companies alone can solve. “When I’m told 'Think of how much time you could be spending instead on making the actual game!', those who have drank the AI Kool-Aid don't understand that all this brainstorming and iteration <em>is </em>making the game, it’s a crucial everyday part of game development (and human interaction) and is not a problem to be solved.”</p><p>“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”</p><p>Francis believes that there’s a common thread running through both their lines of work: that those selling AI tools and those advocating for their use, whatever their best intentions, think that AI is solving a huge problem games industry workers are facing. “The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone so we can make cool art. There is no problem to be solved here”.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-kick-female-employee-out-office-2229371365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drawlab19</a></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Ricky </strong>is a senior game designer who says they were often asked to use AI on their last project, initially with the goal of saving time on basic tasks. One example they shared was being encouraged to use Chat GPT to do things like “generate outlines of existing games and their systems so that we could use them as references and discussion points. The issue? [The outlines] were often wrong, and I'd spend more time fixing them than if I'd just done it the old-fashioned way”.</p><p>Since the AI was generating responses for games Ricky was already familiar with, they could easily see that those responses were fundamentally incorrect. ”When I say they were wrong”, Ricky says, ” I mean they were talking about systems that didn't exist, items that didn't exist, and outlines of enemies that had incorrect explanations of their behaviour”.</p><p>“There were more superfluous issues as well -- the whole thing read like marketing speak. There were buzzwords everywhere, it wasn't concise, and if I were to try and fix these issues using different prompts, or continuing my conversation with [the AI], well, then I'm just spending time prompt-engineering instead of just writing the fucking thing myself. It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired”.</p><p>Ricky says they were also asked to use Chat GPT as an “idea generator”, to help with tasks like “coming up with a bunch of interesting puzzles” or “creating ideas for enemies”, supposedly to both save time and provide inspirational starting points.&nbsp;</p><p>“It really weighed on the creativity of my role, and again, spat in the face of my expertise”, they say. “It wasn't just this though; the tool itself lacks the intent, context, and limitations of what we're doing. It doesn't have other aspects of the project, influences, references, or personal experiences in the back of its mind, because it doesn't have a mind. Whenever we design something for a game, it's drawn from somewhere, influenced by other things, and filtered through our own experiences as a human. These AI ideas lose ALL of that, turning it into an omega-corporate ‘back of the box’ list of ideas and features”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Sally </strong>is an animator and 3D artist whose most recent video game work was as part of an indie studio working on a VR game. They say that AI tools made deep inroads into life at the studio, beginning with the game’s creative directors and lead designers “playing around with Midjourney” before quickly deciding that they wouldn’t need to hire concept artists, then moving on to declaring that they wouldn’t need to pay <em>anyone at all</em> to create the game’s 2D assets, because those could just be generated by Midjourney then edited in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally began voicing their concerns directly with management when AI moved into the game’s voice work, as bosses began toying with new AI-generated lines trained on work previously performed by voice actors. “I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors”, Sally says, “and was met with a very aggressive shutdown response which was that ‘it wasn't going to ship’ and would only be used as an internal tool, so it shouldn't be an issue at all”.</p><p>“This is pretty awful for the voice actors because there’s not really anything they can do if a studio decides to do something like this. [Studios] already have a bunch of their voice work, and often voice actors will just send the entire recording of their lines over at once. So a studio will have multiple takes of each line, and sometimes different variations of the same line, which is kind of a perfect example for something you could feed through AI”.</p><p>Sally was recently laid off from the studio, along with a few of their coworkers, and says that as far as they’re aware the studio’s plan for its next game is to use AI-generated animations trained on motion capture to replace the role of a human animator. “I think the last thing I want to add is just how frustrating it is having AI-generated art in a game that’s about to ship, alongside all the hard work that we human artists put into it. All because one of the directors wanted to cut down on ‘wasting time’ or ‘hiring one other person’”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[AI] has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Audrey </strong>is a veteran concept artist who has worked both as a freelancer and in-house at studios in the video game industry. With qualifications in both art and game design, they say that over the last few years the emergence of AI tech in the art world “has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it”.</p><p>“My own use of AI in my current job has been minimal and against my own wishes and ethics”, they say. “Once in a blue moon I have been given a task that necessitated using AI to make very VERY quick concepts. And when I say ‘necessitated’, I would be told explicitly to use AI and make a ton of images to pick from, and I could then ‘make them look good later’. Depressing doesn’t begin to cover it”.</p><p>Audrey says that their work deadlines are “being completely fucked up as well”, as they will usually need to completely redraw AI-generated images that colleagues in other departments have relied on as placeholder art, which then shifts their own workflow and priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey says their team’s overall response to AI tech has been “mixed”. “Only a few specific people higher up like to use AI and will use it regularly, while the majority of the team is neutral or completely against using it”, they say. “My own personal opinion was quite vocal. I tried to be clear about my stance on using AI, and so did the rest of the art team. I gave multiple reasons for our company to stop or minimize using it; I’d ask about replacing images that were AI placeholders or if there was a way we could use art already made instead, all of which had mixed results”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alfie </strong>is an experienced 2D artist in the video game industry. They recently interviewed at a startup games studio with millions in funding, and came away deeply affected by AI without even working there.</p><p>“This corporate, tech-backed startup near me were looking to hire an artist”, they say. “I went through their entire recruitment process, which took around five weeks, including a trip in person to visit them for several hours. I even took part in a brainstorming session for about an hour, where I ended up coming up with a production plan with some basic schedules. After around three weeks of not hearing anything back from them, they finally got in touch to say they wouldn’t be progressing with my application”.</p><p>Alfie wonders if the studio might have simply been using them for some free art and production consultation. “They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games”, they say. “There are zero artists on their team”.</p><p>Alfie has since joined a new studio, which <em>had </em>been experimenting with AI-generated imagery a few years back but abandoned its use entirely after finding the results neither accurate nor specific enough for in-game purposes. This studio changed course entirely, and Alfie’s hiring was part of a heavy investment in human art.</p><p>“I guess they realised that AI imagery can't solve all of your problems, and they realise just how precious real human artists are”, Alfie says. “A human artist will research the material properly, with all the nuances of human emotion and logic, and ultimately produce art assets that are historically accurate, game specific and have soul”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Douglas </strong>is a voice actor whose jobs include recording lines for indie video games, and says their experiences discussing AI with potential employers "feels like screaming into a void". "I've gotten through to small indie teams", they say, "and some publishers have been empathetic and understanding when I try steering them away from AI, since it hurts already-struggling independent artists and actors. But it's always the larger corporations that are eerily silent and flat out seem to ignore anyone who wants to talk about the subject".</p><p>As an example, Douglas says Audible has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239903/amazon-audible-audiobook-narrators-ai-generated-voice-clones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begun trialling a system where actors can submit their recordings to an AI program</a> that will duplicate their voice, then sell it to book authors for their audiobooks. Those actors will then receive a small percentage of any income the AI 'voice' generates, but Douglas can easily see that becoming problematic for the market, with existing (and upcoming) voice actors able to be easily replaced by anyone looking for a "quick and easy" solution.</p><p>I asked Douglas how they and their peers are feeling about this, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and other challenges being presented by AI in the voice acting space</a>, and their response was blunt. "Myself and a lot of my fellow voice actors are in the same boat", they say. "None of us feel like submitting our voice to an AI is worth the benefit, because it will destroy a lot of the human emotion we put into our work to help bring a story to life".</p><p>"A lot of us worked tirelessly to make even a fraction of a living doing something we genuinely love, and we're afraid of that being taken away from us, so it's looking like we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion".</p><hr><p>These are just some people’s personal experiences, a small snapshot of how AI is affecting the games industry. While <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveys and numbers</a> can provide some sense of scale, individual experiences can highlight the precise ways AI is encroaching into people’s workplaces and lives, how they feel about it, and how they’re responding.</p><p>As grim as some of these responses feel, I hope there’s at least some small solace to be taken from the fact that so many artists remain firm in their resistance to AI technology that devalues their work, and are championing human creators in the face of it.</p><hr><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

IGN and Maxroll have teamed up to bring you lots of new, helpful guides and builds to take on the daunting swatch of new stuff that we will do our best to summarize here: Patch 0.2.0 brings more ways to play with the all-new Huntress Class along with 5 Ascendancies, Azmeri Wisps to chase, shiny new Uniques to hunt for, and a revamped endgame experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">The Huntress</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/huntress-1744061318230.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A new class joins Path of Exile 2’s roster of characters, the Huntress. This Azmeri lost everything when she used a Virtue Gem to defend her home. So now she wields new skills in addition to her trusty Spear. The Huntress is a Dexterity class that shares a starting area with the Ranger in the lower-right portion of the Passive Skill Tree. Spears have a mix of close-range melee strikes and long range projectiles with bonuses that incentivize the use of both. Create an elemental surface with Frostbolt, drop a Whirling Slash, and unleash a flurry of Twisters, before leaping back in to do it all again. Another new item class is Bucklers, a special shield with the ability to Parry regular attacks. When you Parry an enemy you put them off balance increasing the attack damage they take. Unlike Souls games, there is no Parry window and you can use the Parry to animation cancel other skills making it quite agile. However, each time you Parry your stun meter increases and when the bar is full you are heavy stunned for 2.5 seconds, which is likely to result in your untimely demise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dive deeper with <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/news/patch-0-2-0-dawn-of-the-hunt-reveal-megapost" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxroll’s Dawn of the Hunt Megapost</a>, or read on for more information.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">New Ascendancies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new Huntress class, Dawn of the Hunt adds 5 new Ascendancies to Path of Exile 2. After <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/getting-started/trials-of-ascendancy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completing a Trial of Ascension</a>, your Ascendancy further specializes your class by unlocking new synergies and catering to unique playstyles. The Huntress has 2 Ascendancies to choose from, Ritualist and Amazon, and the Warrior, Witch, and Mercenary each get one new option.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ritualist</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/ritualistascendancynodes-1744061367270.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ritualist learned in the depths of the Wildwoods, that power is achieved through sacrifice. You can steal bonuses from Rare monsters, or sacrifice a portion of your own health for a random bonus. With <strong>Corrupted Life Force,</strong> you gain a skill causing nearby enemies to grow <strong>Volatile Blood Boils</strong>, slay them to infect surrounding foes with <strong>Corrupted Blood</strong> a powerful degenerative effect that deals <em>Physical Damage</em>. The <strong>Unfurled Finger </strong>Notable grants a third ring slot, this is especially potent when paired with <strong>Mystic Attunement </strong>and a high-end ring. Lastly, the Ritualist has a variety of charming bonuses making it easier to combat dangerous elemental effects.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/amazonascendancynodes-1744061458869.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">An Amazon strikes swiftly. <strong>Elemental Infusion</strong> consumes charges to add elemental damage to your Attacks, and <strong>Infused Avata</strong>r gives a chance for your projectiles to benefit from the infusion without consuming it. <strong>Critical Strike</strong> and <strong>Penetrate </strong>further scale damage, based on accuracy rating, which is particularly notable because Dexterity classes have easy access to accuracy. Defensively, <strong>Mystic Harvest </strong>opens up access to leech, a recovery layer usually limited to Physical damage, and <strong>Azmeri Brew</strong> makes Flasks far more versatile. Lastly, her <strong>Predatory Instinct </strong>and <strong>In for the Kill </strong>Notables grant massive bonuses against Wraeclast’s most dangerous foes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Smith of Kitava</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/smithofkitavaascendancynodes-1744061520857.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Smith of Kitava wields the Devourer’s power to his own ends. This ascendancy is harder to nail down, as many of the bonuses like <strong>Temper Weapon</strong>, <strong>Maifest Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Fire Spell on Hit</strong> are the sort of thing you need to play with to truly understand. However, <strong>Coal Stoker</strong> and <strong>Forged in Flame</strong> provide some of the most powerful defenses in the game. With <strong>Coal Stoaker</strong>, you need to dedicate less of your suffixes to resistances, meaning there’s more of them to use for damage. Maximum resistance is incredibly potent, with even as little as +5% Maximum Resistance mitigating around 20% of the elemental damage you take. Lastly, there’s <strong>Smith’s Masterwork</strong>, the ability to forge yourself a custom chest piece at the cost of some Ascendancy points. How useful this is depends on where <strong>Living Weapon</strong>, <strong>Against the Anvil</strong>, and <strong>Heat of the Forge</strong> fall as you only get 8 Ascendancy points to distribute amongst all the passives. With that said many of the passives including, <strong>Dedication to Kitava</strong>, <strong>Support Straps</strong>, <strong>Flowing Metal</strong>, <strong>Molten Symbol</strong>, and <strong>Kitavan Engraving</strong> all have potential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lich</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/tacticianascendancynodes-1744061506306.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A Lich wields forbidden power, even at the cost of her soul. First, there are some fan-favorite nodes from the original Path of Exile in <strong>Rupture the Soul </strong>and <strong>Dominion Over Flesh</strong>. Being able to curse enemies to make them explode into piles of loot is always a good time. <strong>Soulless Form</strong> provides a unique way to solve mana by increasing your maximum life. It also splits damage between your life and energy shield which is useful when you have easy ways to recover both. <strong>Eternal Life</strong> further enhances this effect, because your life cannot change while you have energy shield any damage split to your life is ignored so long as you have energy shield active. <strong>Atziri’s Distain</strong> splits damage to your life allowing you to ignore even more damage. Then there’s <strong>Necromantic Conduit</strong> and <strong>Blackened Heart</strong>, a way to provide a significant damage buff to yourself or allies, and what better allies exist than the mindless dead bound to your command? Lastly, Crystalline Phylactery, Price of Power, and Eldrich Empowerment offer solid bonuses to a variety of builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> there is a slight error in the graphic, <strong>Blackened Heart </strong>should be the node after <strong>Necromantic Conduit </strong>and <strong>Dominion Over Flesh</strong> should be the node after <strong>Rupture the Soul</strong>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tactician</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/lichascendancynodes-1744061514213.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tactician never works alone. This is a support-focused Ascendancy for the Mercenary class. It provides a variety of bonuses focused on Auras and buffs.<strong> A Solid Plan</strong> is particularly noteworthy as it’s normally difficult to scale your Spirit without using Sceptres. With <strong>Suppressing Fire</strong> and <strong>Right Where We Want Them</strong>, you can Pin foes to prevent them from acting, adding another crowd control effect to your party’s toolkit. <strong>Unleash Hell! </strong>Is a unique skill that gives you personal artillery, summon them to unleash a barrage of withering fire onto the battlefield.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Azmeri Wisps</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/spirits-cinematic-1744061829344.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With each new league, comes a new league mechanic, and for Dawn of the Hunt it’s Azmeri Wisps. Follow the lights and slay any monsters they empower. Each Wisp enhances the rewards of any monsters it empowers while giving them a variety of lethal bonuses. For example, a Cat Wisp gives empowered monsters Critical Hit Chance, whereas a Sacred Wisp upgrades the monster’s tier, turning Rares into Unique Bosses! Each time you encounter a Wisp it seeks out a Rare or Unique monster to infuse, greatly increasing the creature’s strength and its rewards.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Rogue Exiles</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/rogueexilescinematic-1744061738609.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can encounter Rogue Exiles, NPC invaders who fight like players and even wield powerful items. If you’re able to slay them, you get all the items they’re wearing, but be warned, if they slay you they escape and take their riches with them. Rogue Exiles provide a different kind of challenge since their builds work like a player’s, with a wide variety of skill combinations on offer. These foes tend to be more agile than most bosses, but aren’t as tanky. Keep an eye on their Unique items as these can be extremely valuable, and may make the encounter much more difficult!</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Endgame Revamp</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/rougeexilegameplay-1744061926517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of the Hunt brings sweeping changes to Path of Exile 2’s endgame experience. The goal is to make mapping more exciting by providing players with more random encounters while reducing tedious busy work. You can now use up to 3 tablets in each Tower, this reduces the amount of busy work needed to enhance the nearby maps and maximize your loot. To balance this, fewer Towers spawn and they have been revamped to be more rewarding. Mechanics can spawn in Towers and they are guarded by a Unique Boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Corruption mechanic has also been changed, you now choose between clearing each corrupted map, or rushing to the center to purify the cluster, changing the rewards, and unlocking the new purified map type. You can choose to farm the corrupted zones, slaying additional enemies in hopes of gaining currency and rare items. Alternatively, you could rush to the nexus to purify the zone in hopes of obtaining more Fraturing Orbs. This is a crafting currency that locks an affix on an item with 4 modifiers, making it unmodifiable by any means.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/shatteredlakegameplay-1744061926517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a wealth of content to explore. In addition, Unique Maps present special challenges, each is difficult but rewarding. The <strong>Fractured Lake</strong> (pictured above) rewards you with exclusive base types that have more Prefixes or Suffixes than are normally possible.<strong> </strong>A<strong> Crystalline Cavern</strong> presents you with a room full of Essences to claim. Each one you defeat further empowers the boss, making the challenge at the end both more lethal and rewarding. Or you could explore the <strong>Feral Megaliths</strong>, a 10-round boss gauntlet that drops tons of loot and exclusive Runes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond just endgame content, crafting also got numerous changes. You can use Corrupted Essences to craft items with special effects. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/resources/ritual" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When encountering Rituals</a> to the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/bosses/king-in-the-mists-boss-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King in the Mists</a> you’re now guaranteed an Omen, and Omen rewards are more common. If you <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/resources/expedition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore Expedition</a> you can now use your currencies to Recombinate items, merging 2 bases in hopes of keeping desirable affixes.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Patch Notes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/uniquescinematic2-1744061998091.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s almost easier to talk about what didn’t change than it is to list everything that got tweaked, adjusted, or reworked for Dawn of the Hunt. When GGG said to forget everything you already knew about Path of Exile 2, they weren’t kidding. In particular, outlier builds like Archmage Spark Stormweaver and Attribute Stacking Hand of Wisdom and Action Monk saw heavy nerfs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to know more about the changes in patch 0.2.0 and have a strong constitution, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/news/0-2-0-dawn-of-the-hunt-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out the Patch 0.2.0 Patch Notes</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Path of Exile 2 Beginner’s Guide / Leveling Walkthrough</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/azmerispiritcinematic-1744061991769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re a veteran looking to improve or a new player trying to get into Path of Exile 2, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/getting-started/comprehensive-league-start-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxroll’s Comprehensive League Start Leveling Guide</a> holds your hand with step-by-step instructions throughout the leveling process.

The increased difficulty nerfs to meta builds, and buffs to underperformers have resulted in a lot of changes. The Amazon, Lich, and Smith of Kitava have been absolutely dominating the meta during the first few days of the league. Here are a few of the builds being cooked up by the experts at Maxroll.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rake is a travel skill that easily rips through packs of monsters when combined with Stomping Grounds, with this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/tw7210ik" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planner from ZiggyD</a> you can unleash carnage across Wraeclast. Rake has great mobility, decent single target damage and satisfying bleed pops thanks to Herald of Blood. As you keep progressing, you can continue scaling your build using <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/oqe5o00p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goratha's endgame Bleed/Rake Amazon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Amazon is also adept at using Crossbows, combine Glacial Bolt with Artillery Ballista to clear easily while also doing high single target damage. Because your Ballistae can attack enemies while you’re dodging mechanics this build is easy to use against bosses. Check out this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/jbafu0id" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planner from Palsteron on how to build a Crossbow Amazon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for something different, grab a bow and bring winter to your enemies with <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/a08vs0if" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aer0’s Ice Shot Amazon</a>! This build uses Ice Shot to clear and Freezing Salvo to unleash icy devastation on more difficult enemies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the good old explosive Gas Arrow. This was one of the most popular builds for bow leveling at the start of early access and it’s a great way to get your Amazon to maps. Check out <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/t1bwl001" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenkiei’s Explosive Gas Arrow Amazon</a> planner for some inspiration!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly a more endgame build, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/t3cce0i7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crouchung_Tuna’s Lighting Spear Amazon</a>! This build captures the feel of a Diablo 2 Javazon by blasting everything on the screen with lightning. As an endgame build you need to be in maps to start playing it, so use one of the earlier planners through the campaign and then respec to this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lich</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Chaos DoT, or damage over time skills like Essence Drain and Contagion excel at clearing the screen while providing consistent damage. This makes them the perfect choice to pair with the excellent defenses provided by the Lich Ascendancy. Check out this planner from <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/317nx0it" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CaptainLance9 to play your own Chaos DoT Lich</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why fight alone when you can bring your own personal army to each battle? If that’s your preferred playstyle then<a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/3frf0ih8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HelmBreaker’s Minion Army Lich</a> is the build for you. You get excellent defenses from Eternal Life and new Spectres provide you even more mindlessly loyal dead for your army. If you prefer infernal flame you can<a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/d341m0i0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> play a similar build on Infernalist</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are a few more builds on existing ascendancies:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If you’re looking for a hand holdy <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/planner/ijjq4031" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercenary Grenade Leveling Guide</a>.

            <p>
Nintendo has pushed back at suggestions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">Switch 2's price</a> - which has already left some fans reeling - was influenced by early US trade tariffs. But it admits the latest round of tariffs introduced by US president Trump last week are "something we're going to have to address".
</p>
<p>
When Nintendo unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">response to the console's price was swift and unhappy</a>, particularly in the US, where it's set to retail for $450 USD. At the time, many speculated the comparatively hefty price tag - it's the most expensive Nintendo console to date - might have been reached in response to early tariffs imposed by the US.
</p>
<p>
However, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643277/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-doug-bowser-interview">The Verge</a> asked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser how the company had settled on Switch 2's price, he pointed to the console's new and redesigned features, ranging from its bigger LCD screen to reworked Joy-Con controllers. "We want to make sure that this is a device that is approachable, that consumers will see as part of their overall entertainment experiences and will understand that it has longevity to it," Bowser explained. "And all of those factors really go into the consideration of the price."

"Put [the 2nd April tariff announcement] aside," Bowser added. "Any previous tariffs were not factored into the price itself." He noted the company's move "to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories" - namely shifting away from China to Vietnam and Cambodia - had enabled it to get ahead of "the early stages of tariffs". However, he admitted the Trump administration's latest round of tariffs - which include 46 percent levies on Vietnam and 49 percent on Cambodia - are more problematic.
</p>
<p>
"It creates a challenge," he <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-is-actively-assessing-what-trade-war-means-for-switch-2/">told Wired</a>. "It's something we're going to have to address." Bowser also reiterated Nintendo is "actively assessing" the situation and the impact it's likely to have. That mirrors Nintendo's statement last week, when the company took the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to indefinitely delay US preorders for Switch</a>, just hours after announcing they'd begin on 9th April. At the time, it said preorders would be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions", but noted the console would still launch on 5th June. Whether it might now release at a higher price in the US remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
"The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected," industry analyst Daniel Ahmad recently noted of the situation, "and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect." Nintendo isn't the only games company likely to be affected by Trump's tariffs, however. Last week, the The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents all major gaming companies in the US, said the tariffs - which have already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-tariffs-cause-nintendo-and-sony-stock-to-plunge">caused stock in Nintendo and Sony to plunge</a> - will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">"have a real and detrimental impact" on the games industry</a>. "Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced," it explained, "all compounded on top of one another."
</p>
<p>
While it's yet to be determined how tariffs will ultimately impact Switch 2's US release, preorders will go ahead elsewhere in the world as planned. Many UK retailers have seemingly already exhausted their initial stock, but Nintendo's own preorders go live in the UK on 8th April - albeit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">utilising an invite system determined by a strict and rather convoluted set of rules</a>.

          <p>Among the many surprises during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">last week's wider unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> was the pricing: $450 for the console itself and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">$70 to $80 for many first-party games</a>. Now, in a set of interviews posted today (but conducted during last week's unveiling event), Nintendo executives are explaining and defending those prices, even as Trump's tariffs are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">apparently forcing the company to pause and reassess its whole launch strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">speaking to CNBC</a> just as Trump's tariffs were being announced, and said in the moment that "we're still all trying to really understand [the tariffs] better and understand what possible impacts may rise from that." At the same time, he said that the company "didn't consider tariffs into that equation" when choosing the Switch 2's $450 price and instead went with what "we felt that was going to be the right price point for our consumers and the right value proposition if you will for the device that we're creating."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in that CNBC interview, Bowser suggested that Nintendo isn't following the Wii U example of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">selling hardware at a loss</a> in order to gain more potential software customers. Instead, Bowser said the company is "trying to find a way to maintain... margins on the hardware even though they may be more slim than they are on software," and then "to make sure that they're seeing the value in their investment in one of our devices" through software.</p>
<p>Those hardware margins might be hard to maintain in the United States if Trump's tariffs add to the cost of importing consoles manufactured in Vietnam or China into the country. That said, Bowser added that "we've had some time to build up inventories on a global basis," and that "some" Switch 2 units are "landed already... in the United States," which could help delay the financial pain of any tariffs on Nintendo's part.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Things just cost more now</h2>
<p>In justifying the $450 price of the Switch 2, Nintendo executives predictably pointed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/">the system's upgraded hardware specs</a>, as well as new features like GameChat and mouse mode. "As you add more technology into a system, especially in this day and age, that drives additional cost." Nintendo Vice President of Player &amp; Product Experience Bill Trinen <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553517/price-interview-tariffs">told Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, Trinen also pointed toward rising prices in the wider economy to justify the $150 jump between Switch and Switch 2 pricing. "We're unfortunately living in an era where I think inflation is affecting everything," Trinen said.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              The Switch never saw a nominal price drop, but inflation still ate away at its total cost a bit over the years.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Trinen isn't wrong about that; the $299 early adopters paid for a Switch in 2017 is worth about $391 in today's dollars, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. But for customers whose own incomes may have stayed flat over that time, the 50 percent jump in nominal pricing from Switch to Switch 2 may be hard to swallow in a time of increasing economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>"Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time," Trinen told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN</a>. "And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that."</p>
<h2>Is $80 the new $70?</h2>
<p>Talk of inflation extended to Trinen's discussion of why Nintendo decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">sell first-party Switch 2 games for $70 to $80</a>. "The price of video games has been very stable for a very long time," Trinen told Polygon. "I actually have an ad on my phone that I found from 1993, when <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> released on the SNES at $59. That’s a very, very long time where pricing on games has been very stable..."</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Cherry-picking <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>'s price from near the end of console gaming's cartridge era might be a little misleading. But Trinen is correct that $80 in today's money is not out of line with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/the-return-of-the-70-video-game-has-been-a-long-time-coming/">historic inflation-adjusted prices for console games</a>, even in the disc era.</p>

<p>Speaking to CNBC, Bowser said that Nintendo is "not really looking to establish a [new] benchmark for pricing" with <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s $80 price tag. He echoed the same sentiment <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/04/07/mario-kart-world-price-nintendo-doug-bowser/">to The Washington Post</a>, saying that the game's higher-than-normal price is "less about representing the industry... this is really about Nintendo deciding the right thing to do for its products or what the pricing should be for its products overall."</p>
<p>Instead of flat top-end game pricing, Bowser told CNBC "we look at every game and every experience and determine what we believe is the right price point based on that experience." It's a talking point Trinen echoed, telling Polygon that "we take an approach of looking at: What is the experience, and what are players going to enjoy out of this game? What is the length of the game—what’s the volume of the experience? How in-depth is it? And then we price appropriately based on what we think the value of that experience is."</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo of America Senior VP of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/inside-the-smile-factory-nintendos-quest-to-save-the-switch-2-from-reality/#dt-heading-a-dose-of-reality">told Digital Trends</a> that game pricing is still as much an art as a science. "There isn’t an Excel sheet up here where you’re checking boxes, and each time you add $5," Bihldorff said. "It’s a number of factors that probably can’t be easily quantified for each one. And that’s why you’ll see a fairly different set of prices for different pieces of software."</p>

The line and moment, which first appeared in a trailer, has quickly become a viral meme online thanks to social media and TikTok. And while most of the time people just shout out the line and laugh, some showings have reportedly become more chaotic as younger fans and teens toss popcorn, scream, and record the action. At least one of these incidents reportedly led to police being called to remove some troublemakers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained in this new video from YouTuber Zyphon</a></span>, the Chicken Jockey meme has exploded in the last few days as the movie hit theaters.

For one, <em>Minecraft </em>is a very popular game and it’s especially popular among younger audience members who might not regularly go to the theater. Another part of this is that a lot of these young moviegoers are irony-poisoned and believe genuine emotions and reactions are “cringe.” So they overreact to things like Chicken Jockey to mask their actual feelings about something. And of course, there’s the fact that these videos are going viral online. </p><p>Heck, I’m six paragraphs deep into writing about this shit. So if you are a young dude looking to get a hit video, why not go to the opening weekend of <em>Minecraft </em>and film your friends “freaking out” at the mention of chicken jockey? It’s easy clout. And that’s all that matters anymore. Clout and tariffs. Shit sucks. </p><p>Anyway, while I don’t mind people getting excited about movies, I’m not a fan of throwing popcorn around. That shit is uncool and is super loser behavior. People have to clean that up and many theaters are understaffed, meaning a bunch of overworked and underpaid movie theater employees now have to clean up piles of spilled popcorn before the next showing can begin. Don’t be a dick to people working hard to make sure you can enjoy a movie. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Raven Software was forced to step in on April 7 with a new Warzone update in Verdansk after two weapon attachments became overpowered and the number of Buy Stations in trios was incorrect. </p>



<p>It’s not unusual for Warzone updates to accidentally introduce new issues, but Season 3 avoided glaring setbacks. Despite some complaints about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> being too powerful and not having enough armor plates on the map, players have enjoyed having iconic weapons like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/#:~:text=The%20Kilo%20141%20is%20a,to%20complete%20your%20Warzone%20loadout." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a> back in the game. </p>



<p>In addition, Season 3’s weapon-balancing changes created a healthy variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/andrewhighton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meta weapon </a><span><a href="http://-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options</a></span> for short or long-range engagements. In saying that, two attachments disrupted that harmony.</p>

Over the years, there have been several instances of the attachment becoming too powerful in Warzone, and it happened again in Season 3. </p>



<p>With the ammunition type equipped with the <strong>Akimbo</strong> attachment, the pistols consistently<strong> two-shot killed enemies</strong> up close, much faster than every other short-range meta weapon. </p>



<p>This update temporarily restricts the attachment. Meanwhile, the <strong>Thermal 6x Scope</strong> has also been temporarily removed because the scope didn’t have any glint. This was a massive issue because scope glint helps warn players that an enemy is looking at them. </p>



<h3 id="h-buy-station-change">Buy Station Change </h3>



<p>Raven Software <strong>reduced the amount of Buy Stations</strong> to Trios to better reflect the larger squad sizes. Usually, the map scales the number of available Buy Stations based on the squad size of a lobby because larger teams don’t need as many Buy Stations. </p>

                <p>Blue Prince from Dogubomb and Raw Fury has emerged as the highest-rated game of 2025 thus far on GameSpot sister site Metacritic.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a>, players explore a manor with shifting rooms. In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj5usM4tGM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had," GameSpot's Steve Watts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-prince-review-an-intricate-layered-roguelike-puzzle/1900-6418355/" data-ref-id="1900-6418355">wrote in a glowing review</a>. "It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric. Like each of my dozens of permutations of the Mount Holly manor house itself, it is truly one of a kind."</p><p>Blue Prince currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92 on Metacritic</a>, making its aggregate score the highest of 2025. It dethroned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, which currently has an aggregate score of 91. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-roottrees-are-dead-2023/" data-ref-id="5000-664554">The Roottrees are Dead</a> round out Metacritic's top five <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-reviewed games of the year</a> so far. That's some impressive company Blue Prince finds itself in, and suggests it will be this year's indie darling, just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was last year.</p><p>Blue Prince isn't out yet, and if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you won't even have to pay for it when it launches. It will be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10, and it will be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/644803/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-trade-borrow-resell<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641853/nintendo-describes-switch-2-game-key-cards">Nintendo’s new game-key cards</a> during its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">Nintendo Switch 2 event</a> last week, we’re finally getting more details about why they exist and how they can be used. Although they don’t contain a physical copy of a game, Nintendo’s Tetsuya Sasaki <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">explained to <em>GameSpot</em></a> that game-key cards aren’t permanently tied to a specific Nintendo account. The games can be inserted and played on any Switch 2 console, allowing them to be borrowed, rented, and even resold.</p><p>“So key cards will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it’s not tied to an account or anything,” said Sasaki.</p><p>That behavior is different from the Switch games that Nintendo currently sells in retail locations, which feature a download code instead of a physical cartridge. Those codes can only be used a single time and are connected to a specific Nintendo account, preventing them from being resold at a later date.</p><p>Game-key cards automatically trigger a game download when inserted into a Switch 2 console. Once the game is downloaded and installed, an internet connection “...is only required when you launch the game for the first time,” <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415">according to a support page on Nintendo’s website</a>. After that initial launch check the game can be played without an internet connection, as long as the game-key cartridge is still inserted into the console.</p><p>The game-key cards are an unusual format that merges digital game downloads and physical cartridges without quite solving the downsides of either format. Internet access is still required to download the games, and you still need the cartridges to play them. But as Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">Doug Bowser explained to <em>The Verge</em></a>, the game-key cards primarily benefit publishers, allowing them to sell physical copies of games at retail locations that may <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-max-cartridge-size/#:~:text=Switch%202%20Max%20Cartridge%20Size%20is%2064%20GB&amp;text=This%20is%20much%20larger%20than,and%2010%20GB%20sizes%2C%20respectively.">exceed the 64GB capacity of regular Switch 2 game cartridges</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While this can begin to feel a bit repetitive later in the game, <em>South of Midnight</em> seems to understand when enough is enough, closing out <em>just</em> before it stretches itself too thin.</p><p>If you’re mostly just interested in <em>South of Midnight</em>’s story and not so much in scouring its levels for collectibles (more on those below), <strong>you can see the credits roll in around </strong><em><strong>8-10 hours</strong></em><strong> on its easier difficulties</strong>. You could probably stretch this further if you opt for a greater challenge, of course.</p><figure id="" data-id="457efed917a97c50e86951ced9819f18" data-recommend-id="image://457efed917a97c50e86951ced9819f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of South of Midnight battles against a massive alligator with trees sprouting on its back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of South of Midnight battles against a massive alligator with trees sprouting on its back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="457efed917a97c50e86951ced9819f18" data-recommend-id="image://457efed917a97c50e86951ced9819f18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of South of Midnight battles against a massive alligator with trees sprouting on its back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But what if you’d like to see more of what <em>South of Midnight</em> has to offer? Well, you’ll need to be thorough in your exploration and round up multiple collectible types. However, the levels are mostly linear with relatively easy-to-spot side paths housing these notes, health upgrades, and currency called Floofs that can be used to buy new skills. </p><p>Discovering all of these additional collectibles, as well as completing a few simple combat tasks, will be required if you want to earn all of the game’s achievements. Doing so isn’t likely to extend your playtime <em>too</em> dramatically, though. Unless you’re playing on the hardest difficulty and struggling in combat encounters, <strong>you should be able to wrap everything up in about 15 hours</strong>.</p><hr><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is available now on Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
