            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24163208/secretlab-warhammer-40k-gaming-chair-ultramarine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CvasH7">Secretlab’s latest licensed gaming chair design is a chair that would do Roboute Guilliman proud. Modeled after the colors of the Ultramarines’ chapter of the Adeptus Astartes, this latest iteration of the Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair is now available to pre-order from Secretlab, and is estimated to ship by Oct. 7. Priced at $624, this version of the ubiquitous gaming chair comes equipped with all the same features as the stock model of the Titan Evo, but its royal blue patent leather is covered in rich detail worthy of any son of Guilliman.</p>

<p id="QhRkhg">In addition to the crest of the Ultramarines emblazoned on the front and back, you’ll also find a pattern of bolts, vents, and plates designed to emulate the Tacticus power armor of a proud member of the Ultramarines. Topping it all off is a purity seal, giving this chair the emperor's blessing.</p>

<p id="5PLkGB">Like previous versions of the Titan Evo, this version features a generously padded bucket seat in addition to fully adjustable back and lumbar supports and armrests that are height and width adjustable. This licensed version of the Titan Evo is also compatible with the full spectrum of Secretlab gaming chair accessories including the magnetic headrest, swappable armrests, and casters.</p>
<p id="mLLe0e">While I’m personally more of a Chaos Marine main myself, a chair of this caliber will serve nicely until Secretlab can fashion me a throne from the skulls of my enemies. </p>

Most of these photos show Schafer doing mundane things like reading and picking up trash. But one in particular has caught the eye of the games industry, as it shows her playing a Nintendo Switch, but in a way that seems a bit odd.<br></p><div data-video-id="196805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="93" data-playlist="196805,195905,196646" data-current="196805"><div><p>I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22362.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The “play anywhere” mantra has been key to the handheld/console hybrid device since it launched in 2017. In Schafer’s case, the “anywhere” is on the ground between a couch and a coffee table. Honestly, that’s deeply relatable to me as someone who would like to rot and play video games wherever the compulsion strikes, and sometimes that’s on the ground in inconvenient places. But in the photo, she’s holding her Switch and looking at something off-screen. The shot almost reads like she’s using the Switch as a controller for a game on a television. That would have worked for a Wii U, which has a handheld tablet as a controller but typically displayed the main action on a TV. The other option is that she’s playing her Switch on the floor, but is watching something on the TV. Who among us hasn’t been grinding out an RPG on our Switch while marathoning something on Netflix? That’s a universal experience.</p><p>The photo intentionally plays up the silliness of Schafer’s position, as we’re all prone to lose all concept of sitting comfortably while playing games. So the internet weighed in to praise the realness of gamer rot and also wonder just what could she be looking at. What could she be playing? This is where I’d ask you to weigh in about what game she’s playing, but our comments are still turned off. So just ponder it internally, for now.</p><p>Personally, I hope she’s playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span> in preparation for one day being cast as Princess Zelda in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791">live-action movie Nintendo greenlit</a></span>.

The publisher has announced it will hold another June showcase this year on June 7 at 5:00p.m. Pacific Time, and this year it's birthday party-themed.</p><p>The showcase will supposedly celebrate the 15th birthday of Devolver Digital's mascot Volvy, a weird little guy that Devolver <a href="https://www.devolverdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced last year in its 2023 showcase as a gag on the idea of a retro mascot making a return</a>. Devolver Digital itself, as a company, turns 15 on June 25 of this year.</p><p>In celebration of, well, something's birthday, Devolver promises to shower "partygoers with a big handful of gaming gifts, including updates and release dates for upcoming titles as well as some exciting new reveals." Currently, Devolver has a number of announced games still in development including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ape-out-creators-next-game-baby-steps-gets-a-release-window-of-next-summer">Baby Steps</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/neva-official-reveal-trailer-playstation-showcase-may-2023">Neva</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/human-fall-flat-2-official-reveal-teaser-trailer-devolver-digital-showcase-2023">Human: Fall Flat 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crush-house-preview-thirst-person-shooter">The Crush House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This year's Devolver Direct-er, Volvy's Birthday Party will last approximately 20 minutes. If you've never watched one of these events before and intend to tune into this one, prepare for it to get a little strange. In addition to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-2023-everything-announced">aforementioned mascot "return" last year</a>, Devolver's events have included <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-direct-conference-2021-summer-of-gaming-pony-island-inscryption">parodies of massive gaming conferences</a>, subscription service japes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-summer-showcase-2022-everything-announced-revealed">a malfunctioning mecha Suda51</a>, and a "marketing countdown to marketing." Who knows what this year will hold?</p><p>Devolver's event will take place over a busy weekend both online and in Los Angeles. Folks tuning in digitally can catch showcases from Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-june-2024-xbox-showcase">Xbox</a>, and the all-encompassing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> all covered here on IGN, while folks in LA can check out our own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-event-june-2024-la-gaming">IGN Live fan event</a> featuring developers, publishers, creators, and more across both gaming and entertainment. </p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/atari-announces-intellivision-brand-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/13/microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which&nbsp;confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.</p>

<p>Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."</p>

<p>Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/mr-run-and-jump/the-rewards-of-repetition">Mr. Run and Jump</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration/a-half-century-of-gaming-history-stuffed-into-an">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a>. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/09/22/90-minutes-with-atari-ceo-wade-rosen-all-things-nintendo">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="336" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Hellblade 2</em> is almost entirely a linear experience. Barring some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/can-you-remove-the-black-bars-in-hellblade-2/">slight changes</a> in how you tackle combat or how quickly you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-open-the-village-gate-in-hellblade-2/">solve puzzles</a>, each player gets from point A to point B in the same way. That is, except for one specific moment near the end of the game. Here’s whether you should help Fargrimr or Astridr in <em>Hellblade 2</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-should-you-go-with-fargrimr-or-astridr-in-hellblade-2" data-injectable="false">Should you go with Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2?</h2> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">This choice appears when proceeding through the Jarnvior forest near the end of <em>Hellblade 2.</em> As you progress, you’ll link back up with your companions who are experiencing their deepest fears come to life. Senua partially helps both Fargrimr and Astridr with their issues, but then comes upon a crossroads where she must choose who to help. The one who’s lost his way, or the one who fears what can’t die by the blade.</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">While this may seem like a big choice, who you choose here doesn’t affect the main story in any meaningful way. You’ll help one of them navigate the forest for a few moments before finding the other down the path, shaken up but no worse for wear. After meeting up with Thorgestr, the story proceeds as if the choice never came up.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="false">While it is a little sad that neither choice matters, it’s likely Ninja Theory just wanted to test your thoughts on who you’d help in that situation more than making you decide who lives or dies. If you had to choose between someone who could no longer fight for themselves and someone who could no longer see the path forward, who would you choose to save?</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-pet-the-dog</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-you-can%E2%80%99t-pet-the-dog-in-hades-2-yet.879774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hades-2-pet-the-dog<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a dog in <em>Hades 2</em>. You might know him already; you might not. A lot of people have been asking if you can pet him. Let me go ahead and clear things up for you: You cannot. For now.</p><p><strong><em>Hades 2</em></strong><strong> spoilers follow.</strong></p><p>Cerberus is back in <em>Hades 2</em>, but sadly, he’s not having a great time! Zagreus is out of action, Hades is imprisoned, and their loyal hound is wandering the Fields of Mourning, which – in fairness – is about as good as it gets if you’re feeling a little down and want to go cry (or rampage) about it. Unlike in the first <em>Hades</em>, you’ve got to fight this warped version of the three-headed hell hound, but if you manage to bring him down – and not <em>put </em>him down; a crucial distinction – he snaps back to his senses. Afterward, you can find him chilling with a chained-up Hades, who is also about as glum as they come.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, <em>Hades 2</em> does give you the option to try to pet Cerberus. However, if you press the button, the game informs you that Cerberus refuses, and then he pushes you back with some sort of dog-anger forcefield. You can attempt to pet him each time you encounter him during a run, but the result will always be the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Bear in mind that <em>Hades 2 </em>is currently in early access, so at some point in the future, Cerberus might start barking a different tune. I’m writing all of this not to craft some kind of SEO-chasing guide to harvest clicks from desperate dog lovers, but rather because it occurred to me today that it feels like Supergiant is purposely delaying gratification here – in a game where you can already pet almost every other creature. Frinos the frog, Toula the cat, Hecate’s dog and polecat – <em>Hades 2</em> is an all-you-can-pet buffet. But Cerberus, who you could pet after nearly every run in the first <em>Hades</em>, remains conspicuously off-limits. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chekhov's dog pet</a>. Eventually, something must come of it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hades 2 WHAT HAPPEN IF YOU PET CERBERUS" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOqIaV5_NXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This says to me that Supergiant is setting up an emotionally-devastating dog-petting moment, one for the ages. And they’ve begun the setup <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least half a year in advance</a>, which might be some kind of record. Supergiant’s narrative chops in mind, I imagine The Pet will land for players no matter when they started <em>Hades 2</em>, but I bet it will end up meaning the most to folks who began playing during early access, when giving the traumatized canine a reassuring pat on the head(s) was truly impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with <em>Hades 1</em>, this is <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of what makes <em>Hades 2</em>’s mad dash through early access interesting</a>. No matter how much Melinoë rages against Chronos’ clockwork machinations, she’s stuck in an endless loop. The story, at least for now, is about how she and other characters cope with that fact. But it won’t always be! And then all we’ll have of this version of the story is our memories. We’ll talk about those memories with those who were – and were not – along for this part of the ride, and they’ll take on greater significance still. Together we’ll make a myth, or at least something resembling one.&nbsp;</p><p>So no, you can’t pet the dog in <em>Hades 2</em> yet, but when you finally can, that single button press is gonna go <em>crazy</em>.&nbsp;Hopefully we'll <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-you-can-only-pet-one-of-cerberus-three-heads-in-had-1845106210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be able to pet all three heads</a> this time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Naughty Dog might have hit a snag with The Last of Us Online, which was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in December 2023 after being labeled <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-project-ever-says-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most ambitious project</a> the studio had ever conceived.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog chose to stick with its highly successful formula of making narrative-driven single-player games rather than invest a great deal of the studio's resources for many years in the continued development and support of a live-service game.</p>
<p>Despite this failed endeavor, the studio's millions of fans are still very much looking forward to the next project. Today, Naughty Dog co-president and head of creative Neil Druckmann talked a bit about it in an interview <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Sony's website</a>. Druckmann called it the most thrilling project he has worked on yet and teased it may redefine the mainstream's perception of gaming.</p>
<p><em>I've been lucky to work on several dream projects and am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet. There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up. This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.</em></p>
<p>His statement is as intriguing as it is vague. Is he referring to an even bigger focus on cinematic flair and narrative-driven gameplay? Be that as it may, it's probably still going to be a while before we learn anything concrete about Naughty Dog's new game, even though it's been four years already since The Last of Us Part II. Until an official reveal comes, we'll have to stick with such cryptic teases.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-animal-well-and-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-fostered-puzzle-solving-communities.879759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163189/animal-well-lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzle-game-communities<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dg0J3J">If you’re a puzzle game fan, you’ve had one heck of a month. Within a span of two weeks, two of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24114511/best-puzzle-games-play-ios-android-windows-playstation-xbox">2024’s best puzzle games</a> — or, simply, best games — were released with Big Mode’s <em>Animal Well</em> and Simogo’s <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The puzzles couldn’t look or play more differently: <em>Animal Well</em> is a platformer that prioritizes environmental puzzles, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not">somewhat like a Metroidvania</a>, while <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is a puzzle box disguised as a walking simulator, pulling together logic, math, physics, and language puzzles. And yet, both games are labyrinthian mazes with tons of mysteries and secrets; the way <em>Animal Well</em> gates off puzzles until you find a very specific item mirrors the way <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>withholds a key piece of information until you’ve opened the right book or unlocked the correct door. For games that look nothing alike, the act of playing them — and solving their most mysterious puzzles — feels undeniably similar.</p>
<p id="ZWtzHY">Despite these similarities, I’ve found there’s something different about these games that’s manifesting in their two very different online communities. In <em>Animal Well</em>, I look to online communities like Reddit or the official <em>Animal Well</em> Discord for hints — that kind of mass collaboration is actually essential to solving at least one of the game’s puzzles (more on that later). But for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I’m turning to individuals — friends and family — who are willing to talk through some of the game’s most devious puzzles. </p>

<p id="NvZJwA">It’s partly because <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> doesn’t have an official Discord or an active Reddit page. I also think there’s something to the need for actual, real-time, one-on-one conversation and collaboration to solve <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>’ complicated puzzles. Simogo co-founder Simon Flesser told Polygon via email interview that online interactions, like those in an official game Discord, tend to be questions with direct answers — not back-and-forth conversations. Solving <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> collaboratively looks more like brainstorming answers for a crossword puzzle with your roommate, while <em>Animal Well</em> feels like digging for secrets in online forums.</p>
<p id="jTMURa">“We definitely want to enthuse communication between players and internally,” Flesser said. “Solving puzzles and problems is much easier when you verbalize and reason about the issue at hand. We think this type of social aspect is really interesting, especially as it doesn’t even need to happen while you are playing the game.”</p>

<p id="o6cGZK">[<strong>Ed. note</strong>: The following paragraph contains spoilers for a late-game puzzle in <em>Animal Well</em>.]</p>
<p id="GcNidp">Flesser said he was impressed by <em>Animal Well</em> and its necessity for collaboration with a larger community — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-well-contains-a-hidden-puzzle-that-requires-at-least-50-people-to-complete">at least 50 people</a>. Basically, this game includes a 50-piece jigsaw puzzle, but a single player gets a single piece. A community of players must combine their pieces to put together the puzzle and unlock something else in the game. It’s impossible to complete alone, and it’s very unlikely you’ll be able to amass enough real-life friends to put this together. (At least, I certainly don’t know enough people playing <em>Animal Well</em>, let alone have that many friends to begin with!) A Discord server is not only nice to have when playing <em>Animal Well</em>, but downright necessary.</p>
<p id="joPoo0">Meanwhile, The Gamer features editor Tessa Kaur called <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/trust-me-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-is-a-party-game/"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> a party game</a> — and I agree. There are lots of puzzles, and lots of different types of puzzles. While I may be good at some more standard, video game-esque environmental puzzles, I’m awful at math and word problems. Thankfully, I have two sisters — one who excels at word problems and another who specializes in logic, math-based puzzles. (Then there’s me, who can push buttons on my Steam Deck.) Playing <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>with their help was a lot of back-and-forth, one of us suggesting a solution for me to input. No luck, and we’d try again, working through the logic of whatever puzzle we were on. At times, my sisters weren’t even in the same room as I was. </p>
<p id="qDxZXv">The first time I asked for assistance, I texted my family group chat with a screenshot of a word problem, captioned with just two words: “Please help.” (Unfortunately for my family, the text arrived before the screenshot, leaving my family worried I was in actual danger, not just mental anguish.) My sister, a teacher, quickly solved the actual problem, with an explanation of how it’s done. “Word problems are big in fifth grade,” she added. Like Flesser said, the social aspect of the game continued even though my sisters weren’t <em>technically</em> playing it — I was. </p>

<p id="LhELV9">It was a really interesting exercise in understanding how each of our brains worked through <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> puzzles. This sort of collaboration works in <em>Animal Well</em>, too, but it’s a kind of collaboration that’s only relevant to other people actively playing the game: I can’t ask my mom or sisters what to do with <em>Animal Well</em>’s yo-yo, for instance. There’s no way for them to understand the context, whereas in <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, I can easily screenshot a puzzle for help. Neither sort of collaboration is better than another; they’re just different. It’s something Flesser finds interesting about watching other people play Simogo’s games: “It’s always fascinating to learn how any mechanic or specific part of a game will resonate with a larger group of people. A lot of times a component that seemed very basic to us will feel really special to other people.”</p>
<p id="hovFyZ">He continued: “The level ‘Parallel Universes’ in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880283/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-music"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a> was a good example of this. That applies to puzzles too: It’s interesting to see how people think, and if the puzzles do what they intend to. I think a real good puzzle should be like a good joke; they should lead the player down one straight path, and then suddenly have a funny twist or turn.”</p>
<p id="SnzxYP">If that’s the metric by which we’re thinking about <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> or <em>Animal Well</em>, both are real good puzzle games — ones that their communities, regardless of whether they exist online with strangers or in the kitchen with your family, will be talking about for quite some time. </p>

<p>Activision finally lifted the lid on Black Ops 6 earlier today, revealing key art and the title for the game. It came following months of speculation about ‘Call of Duty 2024’, and while we don’t know much about the game, a few details have been made clear since the teaser snippets started dropping online.</p>



<p>Recently, an employee at Treyarch revealed on social media claimed that they’ve been playtesting Black Ops 6 for two years, stressing that we’re ‘not ready’ for this game. While we knew that Black Ops 6 has benefitted from a lengthier development cycle than normal, knowing that it has been playable to some extent for two years really is something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-long-time-coming">A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolehavin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch’s Nicole Havin</a>, who has been working in Game Designer roles at the firm since 2022, confirmed that she’s been testing Black Ops 6 for two years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Of course, per the typical development cycle of games, the build that Treyarch would have been ‘playtesting’ two years ago would likely have been a framework of a title that would be miles away from making it to the market. Regardless, it’s interesting to know that Black Ops 6 has been playable in at least some state for longer than it took to develop Modern Warfare 3 in its entirety.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Activision revealed the art and title for this year’s Call of Duty, satiating the eagerness of fans worldwide and finally making it clear that this iteration is a follow-on of sorts from 2020’s Black Ops Cold War. We’re seeing references in the teasers pointing to the Gulf War, so the rumours and claims that the game will be set during the 1990 – 1991 conflict are well-founded. </p>

Those who spent money on the game's content demanded refunds but did not receive them, instead they were also promised that all of that content would be intact when the game returned.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MultiVersus Looks To Return With A Bang After Risky Hiatus</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, in May 2024, the self-imposed hiatus is over: MultiVersus is coming back. We got to check out the new PvE Rifts mode, as well as run a few matches with three of the four new characters coming to the roster. We also spoke with game director Tony Huynh about the hiatus, and he believes both of those aforementioned promises are set to come true.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2><p dir="ltr">Huynh tells GameSpot that the information gathered during the open-beta session was invaluable, and it gave the team a clear path to its May 28 launch. The team has grown since MultiVersus was pulled from stores, according to Huynh, and it's allowed them to expand content pipelines, make necessary adjustments, and undertake one particular Herculean task: fixing the netcode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We learned a lot during open beta," Huynh says, "and what we learned required us to do things like rebuild our netcode, which requires us to touch every asset in the game; there's nothing in the game that hasn't been updated to support the netcode." Huynh now calls the MultiVersus netcode "world-class" and says playing with anyone, even across the country, feels "amazing, like you're on the couch together."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded team size at Player First has also helped in not only overhauling the entire game, but creating clear content pipelines--which include "new characters, new maps, new cosmetics, and new game modes" according to Huynh--for the foreseeable future.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Putting on the Rifts</h2><p dir="ltr">A key addition to the MultiVersus experience is Rifts, the new PvE mode where players can challenge multiple routes based on the current events in the game. During our preview session, we had two events available: Multiversal Mayhem, where Joker recruits characters from other dimensions who just so happen to support him; and Rift Detectives, a story revolving around Batman and Velma trying to prove they're the better detective.</p><p dir="ltr">These story elements aren't a major influence on the gameplay, however; they mostly serve to frame the dialogue you'll read between each challenge in your selected path. However, they do add a bit of extra flavor to what is otherwise just a rundown of continuous challenges, one after another, with some forks in the road once in a while.</p><p dir="ltr">These challenges aren't limited to matches against CPU characters, however. MultiVersus borrows from other platform fighters and throws a few minigames into the mix. During our preview, we played MultiVersus's version of Break The Targets from Smash Bros., we shot cannons at Joker balloons a la an arcade shooting gallery, and we raced to outrun an evil force coming at us from the left side of the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">While this mode isn't reinventing the wheel, Rifts does offer a welcome respite from the constant grind of online matches whenever we need it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bolstering the roster</h2><p dir="ltr">The first season of the new MultiVersus--which, according to Huynh, will last two months--focuses on villain characters, which were missing from the roster previously. Three new characters--DC Comics' The Joker, Friday The 13th's Jason Voorhees, and The Matrix's Agent Smith--highlight this first season, with Joker available on day one, Agent Smith coming later in the season, and Jason Voorhees included in the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">We got to test out Joker and Jason, as well as another new addition, Banana Guard, during our preview session, and each one adds a unique twist to the roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Joker is a wily Mage, which means he'll be using all manner of tricks to take down his enemies--which is perfect for the Clown Prince of Crime. He can shock opponents with a hand buzzer, throw projectile playing cards from a distance, and produce a cannon from behind a curtain before shooting it at a foe. Joker is not the kind of character who should be diving head-first into a battle, he's better suited on the outside throwing projectiles and generally annoying the opponents into making a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">Jason Voorhees, meanwhile, is a brutish Tank character who is much better suited to being in an opponent's face. His moveset is made up of iconic moments from his movies; he can fold a bed in half to launch opponents into the air, he can grab opponents in a sleeping bag and bash them on the floor before throwing them away, and he can teleport from one side of the arena to the other using fog. As a tank, Jason soaks up a lot of damage normally, but he can also give himself temporary shield points to make him even more of a sponge.</p><p dir="ltr">Banana Guard, the final playable character, is probably the most straightforward of the trio. As a bruiser, Banana Guard uses strong strikes to knock his opponents back, with most of them coming thanks to his trusty spear. His side special charge attack gives him a dangerous approach option, while his upward normal can attack multiple times and force an opponent into the top boundary quickly.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The old guard</h2><p dir="ltr">While the new characters will get the majority of the attention, the existing roster has seen a ton of changes as well. According to Huynh, every character in the game has gone through some sort of change, though some will be more apparent than others.</p><p dir="ltr">"All of the characters are different now, because the core combat engine is different," Huynh says. "It's familiar, the combat is fluid and feels great, but it definitely feels different than before." Every character now has some new moves in their arsenals, along with new combo routes, and that also comes from the overhauled combat system. "We had to touch everything, everything has been altered in some way."</p><p dir="ltr">One notable example, per Huynh, is also his current main: Arya Stark. "A lot of her kit now revolves around Face Steal," Huynh says, "where she borrows moves from the rest of the cast. Before, it wasn't a core part of her kit, it was just an offshoot, but now it is key to her combo routes." He also says that while before, Arya excelled more in aerial combat, now she's more of a ground-based fighter. "She can still do aerial things," Huynh clarifies, "but she's really strong on the ground now."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Extending an olive branch</h2><p dir="ltr">MultiVersus is adding a ton of new content to its popular platform fighting formula; however, the game does face one significant challenge: Some of the players it left behind might not be willing to greet the game back with open arms. However, Huynh and his team have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-returning-multiversus-players-will-receive-when-they-first-log-in/1100-6523592/" data-ref-id="1100-6523592">nice "welcome back" package</a> for anyone who decides to give them another chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Huynh definitively states that "all characters and cosmetics purchased before May 28 will still be there when they come back to the game." However, the team is planning some "make good" perks as well: For example, "just by logging in, you get Banana Guard and a skin for free." Also, any returning players who log into the game in the first two weeks of launch--from May 28 to June 11--will receive the first battle pass for free. This will, in turn, unlock Jason Voorhees, as he is the level 1 reward for the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, anyone who played the game in open beta and unlocked the entire roster will only have to unlock one new character, Joker, when they log into this new version for the first time. "We understand how players would feel," Huynh said, "and we're trying to make good on that."</p><p dir="ltr">The new and improved MultiVersus will launch May 28 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

Announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2024-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-5429/" data-ref-id="2900-5429">Warhammer Skulls 2024</a>, Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2 is coming to consoles and PC with two full campaigns.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2 will let you play as either the "acolytes of the Omnissiah"--the Machine God--or as the "ancient and deathless Necron legions," according to the official announcement. The two factions will come into direct conflict as Vargard Nefersha wakes from "millenia of slumber" to launch an all-out attack on the Adeptus Mechanicus. It's up to you, of course, to choose which side you'll join, at least until you play through the other campaign.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As with the first game in the series, Mechanicus 2 is a turn-based tactical game. Prior to each mission, you'll be able to manage a garrison and choose from your selection of forces--the first game is often compared to XCOM, if that sounds familiar--and there will be environmental mechanics that will benefit or harm a particular side, adding another strategic layer to combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2 does not yet have a release date, but the game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. As with the original, it's developed by Bulwark Studios and published by Kasedo Games.

                <p>MultiVersus director Tony Huynh has criticized dataminers for spoiling upcoming content in the game, including the reveal of future fighters and stages. Dataminers have regularly trawled through lines of game code to uncover information on unreleased content, and Huynh says that these leaks leave the developers and fans of Multiversus feeling deflated when they're robbed of a surprise reveal.</p><p>"It is an arms race, so it'll be constant protections against new and creative ways to datamine," Huynh said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiversus-director-says-dataminers-do-a-disservice-to-the-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> about the efforts to safeguard information on the game. "At the end of the day, we've done a lot, we've learned a lot, but again, it is an arms race. "I can't promise that there won't ever be leaks or anything like that. But on our end, we've done--I think--above and beyond what industry standards and protections there are."</p>

<p>Huynh also spoke about how the efforts of dataminers to break through these protective systems were both impressive and unfortunate for his team. "It's deflating for the team as well," Huynh said, lamenting the fact that the MultiVersus team couldn't do a grand reveal and that "a lot of the air is sucked out of the room" because of dataminers. "But these things happen, so we're trying to prevent them from occurring in the future," he concluded.</p><p>After a lengthy absence, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-looks-to-return-with-a-bang-after-risky-hiatus/1100-6523676/" data-ref-id="1100-6523676">MultiVersus returns</a> on May 28 with three new characters in its roster.

            <p>
Listen carefully to the finale of last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> trailer, and a familiar musical theme can be heard. Originally titled 'Earth' but best known to fans of the franchise as 'Ezio's Family', you may as well at this point just call it The Assassin's Creed Series Theme. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, when I speak to the brains behind it, veteran composer Jesper Kyd, he says he can't say more about Assassin's Creed Shadows at all - or at least, not yet. That's despite his work scoring numerous games across the franchise to date - and despite his iconic theme being used within Shadows once again. 
</p>
<p>
Whether he's involved more deeply in the upcoming feudal Japan-set Shadows is a closely-guarded secret, it seems. But presumably he can confirm he has at least <em>heard</em> Shadows' version of his theme that's now out in the public domain? "I have," he nods, smiling. "It's a great rendition, it sounds great and it really fits. It always surprises me to hear that theme and how many ways it can be presented. And how it always just reminds you of Assassin's Creed."

</figure>
<p>
But despite Ezio's Family being the Assassin's Creed theme, and despite working on the series since Assassin's Creed 1, Kyd's iconic track only came to life for the series' second entry. And even then, Kyd notes, it's barely in it at all.
</p>
<p>
"When that theme first made its appearance in Assassin's Creed 2, it was such a great moment because everybody in the team were just in such agreement to the way it was presented. Because the theme is not used while you're actually playing the game," he recalls. We're chatting over Zoom a couple of days after the Shadows trailer drops, and ahead of the theme being played in London at another tour of the ever-popular Assassin's Creed concert series.
</p>
<p>
"It's in there a little bit, it's more used in the beginning and the end of the game and it gives it such a good kick off into the experience. When we first released that theme we were very passionate about it, but it's so great to see that players feel the same way."
</p>
<p>
Kyd scored the first four games in the series - 1, 2, Brotherhood and Revelations - in rapid succession, as Ubisoft quickly realised it was onto a Good Thing and made the series an annual event. But while Kyd's theme has remained a constant in the years since, the composer ended up taking an extended break - only returning some nine years later with 2020's Viking-set Valhalla. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Doing every Assassin's Creed every year would be just... it would consume you. And like any other composer I like to do lots of different things."</blockquote>
<p>
"I started with Assassin's Creed 1 and then we had two years to do Assassin's Creed 2 where I did a lot of experimentation and a lot of things I've never done before," Kyd recalls. "I really tried to innovate in my music style. That all took a while to figure out. 
</p>
<p>
"And then for Brotherhood, I had a year. I wasn't asked to do that much music, it's not that long of a score. I believe I did 90 minutes of original music where usually it's at least three hours [as] the team decided to start using songs from Assassin's Creed 2, so Brotherhood has a mix of both.
</p>
<p>
"And then Revelations [was released] like a year later. It's a challenge to keep inventing a new music style when you have a shorter deadline, and I really like to invent something new for every location.
</p>
<p>
"Doing every Assassin's Creed every year would be just... it would consume you," Kyd said. "And like any other composer I like to do lots of different things. For me, it all worked out great and it was such a joy to come back with Valhalla. That makes so much sense - going back to the Viking era as I'm Danish, so I grew up with a lot of Viking information... But it's always such a joy to work on."

Kyd recalls initially being wowed by the series' early focus on open-world gameplay - and its feeling of discovery, something that seems a key feature again in the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
"When Assassin's Creed came out, I don't think any game did exploring that way," he says. "I really enjoy the discovery, and so I try to find ways to make you want to stay in that world - even if you've completed a game. A good soundtrack can really do that, if it's carefully constructed."
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed series has evolved significantly over the past 15 years, to the point where its modern day meta-story is now entirely detached from its historical narrative, and is set to be told through the Assassin's Creed Infinity game/hub/experience/thing in the future. But early games in the franchise had you hopping in and out of its Animus device repeatedly - something Kyd tried to reflect in his music. 
</p>
<p>
"[The Animus] was such a huge part of what Assassin's Creed was in the beginning. And I think that is something we now all understand as part of the story. But to set up Assassin's Creed, the Animus was very important. So of course, sci-fi was important. 
</p>
<blockquote>"I try to find ways to make you want to stay in that world - even if you've completed a game."</blockquote>
<p>
"I remember for Assassin's Creed 1, when you were being chased across the rooftops by guards, we had all this escape music," he continues. "And we had all these different states the escape music could be - low, medium and high. Patrice [Desilets, Assassin's Creed co-creator] wanted this music to be electronic, and the idea was the Animus was being pushed to the absolute maximum when you're in those moments - it's why you see screen-tearing and so forth. That's when the sci-fi came out and why it's scored that way. 
</p>
<p>
"In Valhalla, the sci-fi is done in a different way. I wanted the score for Valhalla to sound more realistic and I didn't want any electronic elements in there because the game was so incredibly gritty and realistic and everything took place outdoors in really large, natural environments. You're just so far away from hidden locations in cities where some sci-fi stuff might be going on in a dungeon somewhere.
</p>
<p>
"But the way I was able to blend the Animus and the sci-fi aspect into the music was I filtered and processed all the live performances. Everything had to start from the foundation of being a live performance, but then I would filter and process everything on top. It gave it a different sound. It's not a super-authentic Viking sound, that was never the idea. But the idea was  it could fit in the Viking era and then I would process everything to make it feel more modern, so that was the way I filtered in the Animus on that."
</p>
<p>
Hearing Kyd talk excitedly about his work on the Assassin's Creed series, I don't get the feeling his time with it is done. "It's not a closed book at all," he says, when I ask if he would return. And until then, his theme will continue defining the series' sound, wherever it goes. It must be a source of pride, I ask, that this theme continues. "Yeah, absolutely," he concludes. "It is."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to Mario’s traditional platforming adventures, the story is mostly set dressing. There’s an intro about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Peach being captured</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Bowser turning into a sentient castle</a>, and then you get on with the jumping and exploring. But there’s a rich and interesting world that goes underexplored — which is where Mario’s roleplaying spinoffs come in. Since the original <em>Super Mario RPG</em> on the SNES, these games have not only given more stories and character to the <em>Mario</em> universe but they’re also somehow even weirder than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">the already quite weird mainline games</a>.</p><p>And with the addition of the new remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, the Nintendo Switch (and its subscription service) has slowly turned into a great starting point for getting started with the <em>Mario</em> RPG universe.</p><p>The obvious place to start with the franchise is <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. For a while, that was easier said than done. Unlike most Nintendo games, <em>Mario RPG</em> hasn’t been ported all that much; there’s the original SNES version, rereleases on the Wii / Wii U virtual console, and its inclusion in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/27/16363696/super-nintendo-snes-classic-edition-review">SNES Classic Edition</a>. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23960646/super-mario-rpg-review-nintendo-switch">last year, the Switch got a full-on remake</a>, which doesn’t change much aside from introducing proper 3D graphics and some quality-of-life tweaks.</p><p>But it didn’t <em>need</em> to change much: this game is a delight. Created in collaboration with <em>Final Fantasy</em> maker Square Enix (then SquareSoft), it’s a fairly traditional RPG — which means turn-based battles, gear upgrades, and magic — that turns the Mushroom Kingdom into a fever dream of a fantasy realm. It somehow manages to marry slapstick humor with an epic quest, stuff it with <em>Mario</em> references, and still feel cohesive.</p><p>From there, <em>Mario</em> RPGs went on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/12/10972838/mario-and-luigi-paper-jam-interview">two diverging paths</a>. One of them is only lightly represented on the Switch. As part of Nintendo Switch Online’s library of Game Boy Advance titles, you can play <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</em>, which, as the name implies, has players controlling both brothers on a goofy journey to rescue Peach’s voice from an evil bean. To give a sense of how odd <em>Superstar Saga</em> can get: the game opens with a scene where you see Luigi doing laundry and Mario in the shower. It only gets sillier from there. But its playful approach to combat and storytelling makes it stand up even now.</p><p>The other spinoff series is <em>Paper Mario</em>. It kicked off on the N64, and the original game is available as part of Switch Online. What defines this series — aside from the distinct lack of playable Luigi — is its papercraft aesthetic. Not only does it give the games a playful look but it also creates all kinds of opportunities for great jokes and fun gameplay. Depending on the game, Mario can turn into a paper airplane or travel around the world using a fax machine.</p><p>The series arguably peaked with <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>, which originally launched on the GameCube in 2004. It maintains the lighthearted charms and solid yet accessible gameplay of its predecessors, but it builds on them with a surprisingly deep and interesting story and an extremely odd and lovable cast of characters. The remaster on the Switch mostly adds some welcome quality-of-life-tweaks, so that personality remains intact. Unfortunately, from there, the <em>Paper Mario</em> series slowly drifted away from its RPG roots, with subsequent releases shifting more into action territory.</p><p>That said, I have to give a special shoutout to 2020’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Origami King</em></a> on the Switch. While it’s not as pure of an RPG as <em>Thousand-Year Door</em>, it is still absolutely hilarious and has some of the most memorable — and heartbreaking — character moments in the entire series. Bobby the Bob-omb has forever changed how I view <em>Super Mario</em> enemies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether I wanted to check out for 20 minutes or 20 hours, <em>Hades </em>was there, and it was replete with narrative twists and turns, excellent combat, and best-in-class art to pass the time and delight me.

I literally can’t believe <em>Hades 2</em> is like this, despite having had it for some time now. After a few dozen hours with the current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155">early access</a></span> build and multiple attempts on Chronos’ life, I’m in utter disbelief. It somehow polishes rough edges I never even noticed while playing the near-flawless predecessor, and though it is unfinished (it’s an Early Access release), <em>Hades 2 </em>is a <em>force</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h3057"><a id=""></a><strong>A fresh new face</strong></h2><p>Where to start? Why not with where the game starts: as its new protagonist Melinoë and the player embark on their first run. <em>Hades 2</em>, much like its clever predecessor, cuts right to the action yet makes it very clear that it isn’t a simple rehash of a winning formula. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span> immediately expands on the first game’s range of abilities by bestowing Melinoë with new skills thanks to her connection to Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft who acts as a maternal figure and mentor for our new heroine.</p><p>By the time that <em>Hades </em>launched into 1.0, the game’s protagonist Zagreus had access to a stacked armory of weapons, but his own moves were fairly restrained. He had an attack, a heavy move, a dash and a throwable cast. By comparison, Melinoë has at least double the moveset, since she can now charge each of her techniques into what the game calls Omega moves, sometimes boasting different effects and doing greater damage. Instead of a separate heavy attack though, Mel can throw down a casting circle whose effects are augmented according to the boons that she collects over the course of a run. This change, as well as a dramatically slower dash, often makes Mel feel slower than Zagreus ever was, but also much more powerful and tactical. Zag was a straight-up brawler through and through, and brazenly blasting through enemies proved to be the winning tactic in most of my successful <em>Hades </em>runs. This no longer feels like the case in the follow-up. Melinoë feels like she’s more emboldened to be tactical, and <em>Hades 2 </em>certainly plays better when I use her kit to the fullest extent.</p><figure id="" data-id="449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-recommend-id="image://449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-recommend-id="image://449221ff236994e2f2b67e5815e6e4c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë arriving back at camp after a run in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Melinoë also has quite the armory, including a pair of twin blades that have quickly become my favored weapons. She also has an interesting pair of torches that necessitate the constant use of her magick and a ranged skull weapon, as well as a more traditional ax. Though I’ve yet to play with all of them and their numerous aspects equally, I’ve seen enough to suggest that Supergiant most assuredly didn’t rest on its laurels developing new ways to cut your way through hell. When you aren’t fighting though, <em>Hades 2</em> also boasts a number of supplementary systems and features, like resource farming, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-incantations-unlock-first-tips-1851461926">crafting</a></span>, additional currencies, base-building, and even steamy social interactions, that make the current early access build impressive and also massively daunting.<br></p><p>Melinoë isn’t just Zagreus’ mechanical opposite though, she is also his little sister, and her desire for a relationship to the House of Hades is a central thrust of <em>Hades 2</em>. It’s an inspired inversion of Zag’s desire to break free of the very same chains in the first game. Zag was a firebrand and a smartmouth, which in turn made for a charming and roguish protagonist. Mel isn’t too far behind, at least as far as her mouth is concerned, but she leads with sympathy and a determination that strikes a far more resonant chord with me. I never really wanted to rip Zag from his family, even if that was never the <em>real</em> goal of <em>Hades</em>, but I <em>do </em>want to reunite Mel with the family she was deprived of.<br></p><h2 id="h3058"><a id=""></a><strong>A greater pantheon goes to war</strong></h2><p>Speaking of, Mel and Zag do have one other thing in common: neither of them is particularly close to their larger family at the outset of their adventures. For reasons that are revealed over the events of <em>Hades 2</em>, Mel was also raised apart from her aunts, uncles, and numerous cousins on Mount Olympus, who once again return in the sequel to forge relationships with Mel and strengthen her over the course of a run. Favorites like Aphrodite, the embodiment of love and sex, return alongside Zeus and the dazzling Apollo, while Hestia and Hephaestus make incredibly impactful debuts and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-hephaestus-technical-test-fat-greek-gods-1851419788&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-hephaestus-technical-test-fat-greek-gods-1851419788">broaden the spectrum</a></span> of <em>Hades</em>’ limited view of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-aphrodite-gods-characters-hot-sexy-1851423220&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-aphrodite-gods-characters-hot-sexy-1851423220">beauty</a></span>.</p><p>On the matter of boons, <em>Hades 2</em>’s pantheon is even greater than their last outing. Similar boons and some overpowered gods (RIP Athena) have fallen away to make room for a greater range of differentiating abilities. Hestia’s flames singe enemies over time, for example, rewarding players who take their time chipping away at foes. This comes in stark contrast to many of Athena’s abilities in the first game, which often made players invulnerable and emboldened them to dash into the fray. Demeter’s freezing capabilities have always felt powerful, but her late-game addition in <em>Hades </em>muted the arrival of her moveset to some degree. By comparison, I believe Demeter was one of the first gods I met as Mel in <em>Hades 2</em> and her boons have proven to be an essential part of my own kit, solidifying Demeter’s place in my war on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-fight-pause-1851467769">Chronos</a></span>.</p><p>Even the most familiar abilities, like Zeus’ crackling chain-electricity and Poseidon’s crashing waves, feel greater than their previous incarnations, thanks to <em>Hades 2</em>’s art, which is somehow even more gorgeous and vivid than the first game. You have not lived powerfully until you have seen the most violent waves emanate from the swing of your ax.</p><figure id="" data-id="6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-recommend-id="image://6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-recommend-id="image://6430b2998a11e8b406f5315db10a3160" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Nemesis talking to Melinoë in Hades 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s gods aren’t just power ups though, and figure into the story far more heavily. Mt. Olympus is at war with its granddaddy Chronos, who’s sacked the underworld and Hades’ family, and is prompting a war on two fronts. <em>Hades</em>’ depiction of the gods felt celebratory but never challenging. In <em>Hades 2</em> though, the gods are engaged: Hermes is scouting behind enemy lines, Artemis hunts down the forces of Chronos, Charon and the River Styx are our heroes’ supply lines, and absences like Ares and Athena are explained by the fact that the world is, in fact, at war right now and needs their attention. Even some of the lesser gods who fill your base camp throw a little fuel on the fire at times.<br></p><p>Nemesis, who begrudges her post at the Crossroads and wants to fight, will occasionally go rogue, leading to encounters with her in the wild. Sometimes she’ll sit at Charon’s shop pondering what to buy, and if you don’t scoop up everything before her, she could grab a game-changing boon. Often enough, she’ll challenge the player to a competition and make off through a door that had a reward you really wanted. This is much like how interactions with Thanatos functioned in the first game, but here, the writing turns Nemesis into a bristling companion whose loyalties and desires work in conflict to make memorable and defining moments. The larger cast of <em>Hades 2 </em>feel complex and tangible, and I’m fascinated by how Supergiant will continue to mold them over the course of the early access period.</p><h2 id="h3059"><a id=""></a><strong>Revisiting hell</strong></h2><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s narrative and world benefit from an inverted approach. Whereas the first game saw Zag fiercely fighting his way up out of the underworld, the second sees Mel fighting her way back down to her old family home and freeing it from Chronos.</p><p>By the end of the first <em>Hades</em>, you might’ve been forgiven for thinking the team had stretched itself thin in terms of level design. Tartarus’ straight-faced chambers eventually gave way to a sea of environmental hazards in Asphodel, before expanding ever so slightly with the calming (but menacingly packed) fields of Elysium, and culminating in the suffocating chambers of the satyr temple. <em>Hades </em>handled each one of these areas expertly, which tackled a typical tenet of game design and seemed to knock it out of the park.</p><p><em>Hades 2 </em>doubles down on many of the same principles, but does so with such aplomb that their first incarnations look like pedestrian trials by comparison. However, it doesn’t stop there, and <em>Hades 2 </em>successfully blows up ideas and remixes them into something even more novel. Of particular note is the Fields of Mourning, which is <em>Hades 2</em>’s markedly difficult third region that toys with open-ended spaces with a myriad of smaller objectives. This just happens to be an idea that <em>Hades 2 </em>lifts from the most tightly packed region of the first game and splices it into a different mold to great success.</p><figure id="" data-id="7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-recommend-id="image://7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Supergiant Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-recommend-id="image://7368a35fc80d7d5450ea3d2eeddc0865" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Melinoë unleashing an Omega attack in the Fields of Mourning, one of Hades 2's more difficult regions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Supergiant’s impeccable artistry makes this familiar world sing. Each of the regions feel like a far cry from the last, and the boss characters at the end of them are not only wonderful to behold, but a thrill to fight. I hope I never tire of fighting Scylla and her band of sirens in Oceanus, who play instruments and sing songs about fighting you throughout the encounter. Knocking them out one by one will cause their piece of the composition (vocals, drums, guitar, etc.) to go mute, just one of the several inconsequential flourishes that Supergiant deploys to give you some impact in the world.<br></p><p>Just as I began to feel comfortable running the gauntlets of Oceanus and the Fields of Mourning, which led me to several Chronos encounters, <em>Hades 2</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545">revealed a second parallel storyline</a></span> and another gorgeous set of worlds and characters to be introduced to.

I truly mean that. There’s placeholder art all over certain characters and some of the regions featured in the early access build are clearly unfinished. Character arcs are currently suspended in limbo as Supergiant Games works on wrapping up the game for sometime in 2025. There are still places we haven’t seen, dialogue we haven’t heard, and reveals that we’ll just have to wait for while the studio cooks.

Even now, I’m nowhere near done with the current build, but I feel confident enough in what I’ve played to say without a trace of doubt or hesitation that <em>Hades 2 </em>is a hell of a victory lap for Supergiant.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The way it goes on too long. The fact that CBS cheaped out and didn’t license the actual song. The feeling of death slowly embracing you as you watch the poorly animated 2D head of Biden bounce up and down on a somewhat flesh-colored pipe inside a toilet likely grabbed from Shutterstock. It all sucks, man! </p><p>And sure, with the <em>full context</em> of the meme manager bit, this is a little more forgivable, but still...what are we doing? What the fuck are we doing, folks? </p><p>How many people watching a random episode of<em> The Late Show</em> in 2024 know what this is? Even Colbert jokes that viewers should ask their grandchildren about it. What a horrible situation for any poor kid unlucky enough to be asked by his grandma to explain “that dancin’ toilet joke on Colbert.” </p><p>The one silver lining is that we all know that God is dead and the laws of humanity no longer exist.

<p>Sonic Rumble has been penned as a ‘first in the Sonic series’, a multiplayer-based action title that can accommodate up to 32 players, all of whom will assume control of an iconic character or variant from the decades-old franchise. It features survival and racing mechanics, with players tasked with charging through various courses, collecting rings and power-ups, fighting off their opponents, and completing tracks as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the closed beta for the game kicks off tomorrow, which means we can expect snippets of gameplay to start surfacing from this weekend onwards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-ready-to-rumble">Get Ready to Rumble</h2>



<p>Here’s the spiel from the press release that was used to announce Sonic Rumble:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In&nbsp;Sonic Rumble, players will take control of toy figures to compete in thrilling 32-player battle royale challenges, racing against each other to collect the most rings and prove themselves to be the fastest in the toybox. With iconic characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog universe available for customization, players can create their own unique avatars and dive into the action-packed gameplay.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/sonicstadium/status/1793642139936805049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonic Stadium revealed on Twitter</a> that the invitations for the closed beta have finally been sent out, and that some users in North America have managed to get access to the game. They also noted that there doesn’t appear to be an NDA for the beta, which means that testers <strong>should </strong>be free to post gameplay, previews, and screenshots online.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of Sonic Rumble content already out in the open thanks to Sega, but getting the first-hand impressions of legitimate playtesters is always a different story.</p>



<p>Have you applied for access to the Sonic Rumble beta?</p>

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>x <em>Fall Guys </em>collab has returned, giving players the chance to once again win the crown in Blunderville and acquire some sweet <em>Fall Guys</em>-themed rewards. Here’s how long you can expect the return of the event to last, as well as how to obtain all of the event exclusive rewards before the event ends.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-ffxiv-x-fall-guys-event-return" data-injectable="false">When does <em>FFXIV</em> x <em>Fall Guys</em> event return?</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">The limited-time <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> x <em>Fall Guys</em> collaboration event returns on May 23, 2024, at 4:00 am EST and runs through June 10, 2024, at 10:59 pm EST. The return of the event offers a chance for those who missed out the first time around to earn all the exclusive rewards, including a mount, framer’s kits, some awesome glam, and even a title.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">There are no new rewards with the return of the <em>FFXIV </em>x <em>Fall Guys</em> event, so if you conquered Blunderville in the past, you can certainly return to defend your crown but will have nothing new to obtain. Players who have already completed the Just Crowning Around quest will be able to jump right back into Blunderville, and do not need to complete the quest again.</p>

She’ll give you the quest Just Crowning Around. You’ll gain access to Blunderville and Custom HUD settings, so spruce those up before jumping in. If you leave Blunderville Square, you can speak to the <strong>Blunderville Attendant</strong> in <strong>The Gold Saucer (X:5.8, Y: 6.3) to get back in</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">To begin an obstacle course, speak to the <strong>Blundarville Registrar</strong> and join the queue for a 24-man showdown for the crown. And if you’re here after the December deadline, don’t fret. The <em>FFXIV </em>x <em>Fall Guys </em>collab is a limited-time affair, but only for now. It will return as a special event at irregular intervals.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How the Fall Guys Collab works</h2> <figure data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

If you want to obtain all of the mounts, minions, emotes, as well as all the Framer’s Kits, glamour, and one piece of each furniture, it will cost you a whopping 6t,120 MFG. The MGF Trader (Prize Claim) in Blunderville Square exchanges your <em>Fall Guys</em> collab currency for those rewards.

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> rapidly established itself as a hack ‘n’ slash that’s not afraid of doing things differently, though <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-acknowledges-major-issues-with-promises-to-fix-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Early Access status</a> means it’s rough around the edges. That’s bound to change as the game is updated, of course, and Patch 2 is proof enough of that.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">Notably, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4188989134082981436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Early Access Patch 2</a> is the biggest update the game’s received yet. Sure, it <em>is </em>only the second major update <em>Wicked</em> has gotten so far, but I’ll allow it. It’s a sizeable chunk of improvements across the board, for sure: between performance uplifts, control scheme improvements, all-new gameplay features, and a variety of fixes and balancing boons, there’s a <em>lot</em> to like here.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-patch-2-overview" data-injectable="false">No Rest for the Wicked Early Access Patch 2 overview</h2> <p data-characters="82" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">First things first, then, let’s go over Patch 2’s performance uplifts:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true"> <li>Upscaler availability: DLSS 3.7 and FSR 2.2 options are now both available</li> <li>Various CPU optimizations</li> <li>Performance Mode improvements: lowered texture resolution, leading to better performance and stability on low-end machines</li> <li>Various memory leak fixes</li> <li>GPU culling improvements (lower latency and overhead, with better stability)</li> <li>Steam Deck improvements (optimizations in the texture resolution and memory budget departments)</li> <li>Improved Ambient Occlusion rendering performance</li> <li>Various additional optimizations in art rendering, memory use, and other items</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Impressive stuff across the board, though it’ll take a bit before we can properly quantify just how <em>much</em> better the game might be running now. The presence of upscalers alone should help massively in GPU bottleneck scenarios, however, so that’s great news for sure. Patch 2 goes far beyond just performance improvements, however:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"> <li>Introduces the Respec system via the Cerim Crucible Atrium statue (1 Fallen Ember per attribute point reallocation)</li> <li>Introduces the weapon try-out system: players can equip a given weapon regardless of its attribute requirements</li> <li>(Re)introduces the ‘Misc’ inventory tab that separates Housing Items, Runes, Fallen Embers, and other assorted goodies from the rest of your inventory</li> <li>Added a new set of Enchantments</li> <li>Spear weapons can now be upgraded with ‘Throw’ runes</li> <li>Pig Sticker and Assegai blueprints added to Fillmore and Whittacker’s shops, respectively</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Some extremely solid improvements here, too, but that as well is just the start of it. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4188989134082981436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Steam blog post</a> lists a <em>massive </em>array of other tweaks and changes, many of them having to do with bugs, faulty bounties, localization issues, and various assorted audio improvements. Note that certain VFX instances have been made “juicier,” notably in the blood and gore department, so that might be fun to see in action.</p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">Regardless, things are looking solid so far for <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>! <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/struggling-in-no-rest-for-the-wicked-stop-playing-it-like-diablo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s not a game you can play as you would a regular hack ‘n’ slash</a>, of course, but Moon Studio is clearly unafraid of pushing the envelope here, and I, for one, am thrilled to see what the team makes of <em>Wicked</em>. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-update-brings-dynamic-difficulty-and-much-more.879639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and this one's focused on bringing improvements and features the community has been requesting.</p>

<p>Community Update #1, as it's snappily being referred to, brings a number of features the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>player base has been asking for, including some difficulty tweaks, a new save backup system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, some behind-the-scenes dynamic difficulty tweaks have been made to&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>for solo and co-op scientists, and though the changes are small, developer Deep Field Games says they should "have a large effect on combat pacing in general".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=Topv7J2V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=mzM_pCy8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat difficulty should have been tweaked for the better in the latest&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>A new save backup system has also been introduced, and it should help if you've found your&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>world being corrupted (beyond the aliens-trying-to-murder-you corruption, which is totally normal).</p>

<p>The game will now keep up to five backups just in case something terrible happens to your world, and if a problem is detected,&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>will ask if you'd like to use a backup instead. This system works for dedicated servers, too.</p>

<p>Improvements have been made to Repair Benches, too; they'll now pull ingredients from nearby storage if a bench has the Item Transporter function, and a number of other, smaller improvements have been made as well.</p>

<p>You can now paint your Cement Bag Walls, so you can make them look like a giant game of&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>if you like, and small storage crates can also be painted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-painted-walls.jpg?itok=AQp-EaDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-painted-walls.jpg?itok=zNPIOdPZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to paint your Cement Bag Walls in&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>? Well, now you can!</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>Community Update has a ton of other small changes and tweaks that should all go together to make your gameplay experience smoother. You can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4331978422249478585/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is a survival-crafter set in an underground research facility where something has gone very awry. You - and, optionally, your friends - must carve out a life for yourself by scavenging for resources, navigating the facility, and avoiding being killed.</p>

<p>The game has managed to pick up an audience for itself; within its first couple of weeks on sale, it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">rack up around 250,000 sales</a>, no mean feat for a game that's entering a pretty crowded market.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23780463/bread-and-fred-where-to-play-tiktok-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SguPqV"><em>Bread and Fred is </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bread-and-fred-switch/"><em>now available on Nintendo Switch</em></a><em> — a great platform for its special brand of co-op play. We’re re-publishing this story for the added console release.</em></p>
<p id="gctezw">In <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em>, you’re tied to another penguin by a very short rope, and you’ll need some serious teamwork to make the climb. So, Ana and I (Nicole) are taking on our impressions together, as a team. Think of this story as the rope tying us together to bring you our thoughts on the game’s chaotic platforming. We’re each writing a paragraph and then letting the other take over; Ana’s paragraphs will be in italics. </p>
<hr id="aDv6D4">
<p id="HxmXfD"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> was released in May by a three-person indie team called SandCastles Studio, and it has been hugely popular on TikTok since. It’s a game that’s perfect for the internet in the same ways <em>Fall Guys</em> or <em>Overcooked</em> are: It requires skill, but even the worst players are rewarded with slapstick animations of squished penguins and hilarious falls.</p>
<p id="8xGdXD"><em>I can only take a step or two until the rope goes taught, and I’m stuck in place until my partner makes progress on their end. Actions like basic jumps to a nearby platform require a level of coordination sometimes hindered by stream latency and potential lag in voice chat. My partner and I stay in constant communication. All of this just so that we can climb a few measly meters. </em></p>

<p id="xjbQOb">It’s hard. The platforming looks relatively simple, but deceptively so. What looks to be simply jumping over gaps is made complicated by the short rope. Thankfully, <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> does have several options to make the game more approachable — one crucial example is a checkpoint system that you can turn on in the options menu. It allows you to put a flag in the ground, which acts as a spawn point if you make one disastrous fall. (We made plenty of those as we started our journey up the mountain.) <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> also has a handy in-game countdown timer, too, which became essential for precise, coordinated leaps, but we developed our own system for areas that required one of us to anchor on a platform while the other swung wildly to get enough force to fling both penguins to the next step.</p>
<p id="DHPuBq"><em>We don’t ascend the mountain very quickly, but the game slowly begins to click. We move in sync, and eventually, each of our penguins looks like a veritable shadow of the other. After dozens of tries, we make an extra-long jump that requires precise timing both on the part of the anchor penguin and the swinging penguin. (No one gets to slack off on this climb!) We use these swinging physics to fling us both to a cave wall. I hold on to the wall while my penguin partner swings to the other side. After completing an extensive series of difficult jumps, our penguins give each other a thumbs-up, and we proudly put a flag in the ground to mark our progress. </em></p>

<p id="tKb5uz">It’s super satisfying to get to those points and to celebrate, but <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is almost even more fun to watch someone else play — you get to luxuriate in someone else’s mistakes. This is where its popularity on TikTok and other social media platforms comes in; you get <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8e3ggwf/">all of the goofs</a> and none of the face-first falling. People like to joke about the game ruining friendships, something akin to Mario Party. That sort of engagement is a big part of the fun of it all, watching or playing, creating moments where you can poke fun at your friends and celebrate your big wins.</p>
<p id="jAA1Jf"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607680/Bread__Fred/"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em></a> is available to play on Windows PC via Steam. It’s got online multiplayer and remote play, as well as a single-player mode.</p>
