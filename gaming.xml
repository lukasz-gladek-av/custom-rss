		<p>The hotly anticipated action RPG Path of Exile 2 will be heading to a PC Early Access launch on 15th November this year, Grinding Gear Games have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2 - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYaSU9UCe0w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition to this date announcement, the trailer gave a glimpse of some of big, bad bosses that will feature in the world of Wraeclast, just waiting for you to come back be the snot out of them.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/16/path-of-exile-2-path-of-exile-mobile-conquerors-of-the-atlas-metamorph-update-3-9-0/">announced back in 2019 during ExileCon</a>, fans of the action RPG have been patiently waiting for the sequel to the emerge. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/09/path-of-exile-2-trailer-gameplay/">The second trailer arrived in 2021</a>, giving a good gameplay walkthrough trailer and explanation of how it melds with the original game in certain ways, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/heres-another-path-of-exile-2-gameplay-teaser/">a gameplay teaser last summer as well</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/reanimal-revealed-by-the-makers-of-little-nightmares-tarsier/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tarsier Studios, the original developers behind the hit horror puzzler <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>, have announced their next horror game, REANIMAL. The game is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="REANIMAL | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ai6lH55Dn8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Reanimal looks to keep a lot of the same kind of terror and tone as Little Nightmares, but will feature a new world, setting and menace, while putting co-op play front and centre. The story follows a brother &amp; sister as they go through this hellish world to try and find their missing friends and then escape a place that they used to call home.</p>
<p>You’ll always play as a duo, whether that’s playing solo with an AI buddy, or in co-op, with support for both local and online play –&nbsp;you can pick which of the two you want to play as. There’s a shared, directed camera to try and keep you together, sharing the scares along the way, and there will naturally be plenty of gameplay elements that rely on the two of you to work together to progress and escape.</p>


<p>This fantastical new horror setting is a fragmented island that you’ll explore by boat and on land, with the game keeping the “small people being hunted by bigger creatures” vibe of Little Nightmares. The horror that is now haunting them, and which tore apart their world stems from a shared past that they have with their friends, and has unleashed monsters with more of an animalistic feel. Tarsier is trying to imbue this world with a sense of violence, so that even an otherwise pleasant pine forest is twisted with nastiness, an industrial region is fogged up and threatening, and there’s literal violence in how the kids’ home was destroyed.</p>
<p>We’re big fans of the Little Nightmares games, and while Bandai Namco is taking that series forward with Supermassive Games taking over the reigns for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/little-nightmares-iii-delayed-until-2025/">Little Nightmares III</a>, it’s great to see Tarsier continuing to explore this genre and style of horror game with Reanimal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/arc-raiders-re-emerges-with-a-2025-release-target/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the most compelling game announcements from a few years ago, Arc Raiders has re-emerged with developer AEmbark Studios confirming a 2025 release date for the PvPvE shooter.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders - Gamescom 2024 Teaser Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxsTWIi4WqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer was very spartan, to be honest, showing next to nothing compared even to the original announcement, but we do have some trailer blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>ARC Raiders is third-person PvPvE action survival shooter coming in 2025. Take on the role of a Raider, fighting for your own survival and that of your underground colony of Speranza — scavenging and hunting for resources that must be extracted home safely from the surface.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/arc-raiders-trailer-game-awards/">Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021</a> at The Game Awards, initially with a 2022 release target, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/09/free-to-play-shooter-arc-raiders-will-miss-2022-launch/">which it then slipped from</a>. A message from the team – helmed by ex-Battlefield lead Patrick Söderlund – explained that they need more time to expand their upcoming co-op shooter.</p>
<p>Geoff Keighley say sthat the game has undergone a lot of changes, but we’ll just have to take his word for it until there’s a big gameplay re-reveal. One of the key differences seems to be the shift to PvPvE, and not just PvE gameplay.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025.958407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands is returning, with the fifth game in the leading franchise announced for 2025. As with most reveal trailers, it didn't reveal much at all. It was a tiny teaser trailer at Gamescom 2024, and the message was incredibly cryptic. Even in the description of the trailer on YouTube, there isn't much for the audience to go on. What we do know is that Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-game-could-be-closer-than-you-think-hints-gearboxs-ceo-randy-pitchford/">set to release</a> on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"In this next installment of the definitive looter shooter, players will assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they blast their way through hordes of enemies in search of new treasures on an all-new planet."</p>
<p>There isn't much information available besides the fact that the game will be released in 2025. Even the Steam page for the game is incredibly empty, prompting people to wishlist the game with a screenshot of the iconic helmet and the new planet you'll be exploring.</p>
<p>The last main franchise game to be released in the Borderlands franchise was Borderlands 3, released in 2019. While plenty of people liked the game and gave it favorable reviews, there was also quite a bit of criticism released, with some even calling it "the best and worst of the franchise" due to how some of the enemies moved and interacted with the players.</p>
<p>Aside from Borderlands 3, the most recent addition to the franchise overall was Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, released in 2022. This game took a very different path to the usual Borderlands style. While it had the same comedy, the same kind of enemies, and the like, you had to build and customize your character using Dungeons and Dragons-style stats.</p>
<p>Again, while most people who played the game favored it, they felt that the issues of Borderlands 3 had seeped into Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and made it less enjoyable overall. One of the significant flaws with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was the reward system used, as it felt as if it didn't reward the player at all. The relevance of the tabletop game additions didn't make much sense, nor did it feel much like a tabletop game.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Borderlands 4 has in store for the audience. Will players see any familiar faces throughout the game, or will it introduce entirely new characters for people to love and hate?</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Borderlands 4, make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist it</a> so you can keep up with any updates that may be announced.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-a-tense-and-terrifying-journey.958404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the success of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a> series, Tarsier Studios is looking now to their next project utilizing Unreal Engine 5. The just-revealed <em>Renimal</em> is an all-new experience from the team known for their atmospheric and mysterious games, meant to appeal to both horror and adventure fans alike.</p>
<p>The game is currently in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series with a release penned in for some time in the future. We had a chance to preview the concept behind <em>Reanimal</em> ahead of its announcement as well as learn more about it from key members of the development team.</p>
<p>Whilst we didn’t get to play or see a live demonstration for<em> Reanimal</em>, the folks at Tarsier did have a trailer on hand, and in it we were able to catch a glimpse of what this new game is about.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/water_town_01.jpg?itok=WW694lJW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/water_town_01.jpg?itok=leB2X9EN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Reanimal </em>is billing itself as a co-op adventure about two kids trapped in a hellish version of their home island. They’ll have to go on a quest to rescue their friends, and to do that they must work together to survive untold horrors.</p>
<p><em>Reanimal</em> is a fully playable game in single player and local or online co-op, with an emphasis on exploring by land and sea, as well as on tension and atmosphere. The idea here is that horror is best experienced with friends, so the playable characters in <em>Reanimal</em> will operate on a shared camera and never be apart.</p>
<p>You’ll have to cooperate to survive in a world that focuses on a grounded, but minimalist approach to co-op gameplay. <em>Reanimal</em> is first and foremost about the horror. It’s mysterious, tense, atmospheric. There are distorted, twisted monsters and locations.</p>
<p>All of this is primed to build on Tarsier’s strengths as a studio.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cinema_01.jpg?itok=2A5e8R8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cinema_01.jpg?itok=clcxe0Gr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
Another aspect of <em>Reanimal</em> is the adventure through a fragmented narrative, as well as non-linear areas to explore by land and sea. All of this culminates in the main characters – kids who are both siblings and orphans whose shared past is at the center stage of the narrative.</p>
<p>Other themes in <em>Reanimal</em> focus on the animalistic monsters, as well as violence.</p>
<p>Speaking with the developers, we learned that the basis for <em>Reanimal</em> sort of revolves around the idea of say, taking <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em> and <em>Silent Hill </em>and smashing them together. There’s a sense of adventure with a thick dread layered on top of it.</p>
<p>As we saw in the trailer, <em>Reanimal</em> will feature voice acting, and some cutscenes. But don’t be mistaken – <em>Reanimal</em> is not a cinematic-driven game. Instead, these scenes will compliment everything else, and give people different avenues about what is going on. There’s not going to be a focus on exposition.</p>
<p>In <em>Reanimal</em>, you’ll choose from one of two characters – a brother and sister – at the start, and while they do play similarly to each other, they also serve as a vehicle for the co-op experience. It’s through them that a shared quest for redemption takes root, despite their dire circumstances.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trainyard_01.jpg?itok=JAJYlwQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trainyard_01.jpg?itok=aOQDrHK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
The dark world of <em>Renimal</em> features an appropriately moody art style as well. Smoky blues and dim lighting dot the landscape, but there’s also elements that stand out such as the bright neon of a sign, or the rear lights of a car. This contrast between cold and warm colors creates the duality of horror and hope the team is aiming for.</p>
<p>From what little was shown so far, <em>Reanimal</em> does look like the type of game to satisfy those who enjoy the horror game genre, as well as anyone who likes exploration and adventure. The co-op element in particular seems to be the most eye-catching, with the potential for shared experiences either at home on the couch or online.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of games doing that these days so if <em>Reanimal </em>can pull it off in a way that keeps people glued to the screen, they might really have something here. That coupled with the interesting atmosphere, creative animal designs, and the idea of a horror game that might not all be completely scary, there’s a lot of room for <em>Reanimal </em>to appeal to more than just the genre’s usual fans.</p>
<p>In any case, we’ll just have to see, but so far, this sort of evolution of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a> seems well on its way to at least differentiating itself from those experiences.</p>

            <p>There's a new instalment of Supermassive's Dark Pictures anthology series on the way, and it's set in Outer Space, wherein you'll find the Darkest Pictures of all. Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!</p>
<p>Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">leaked back in November 2022</a>. Now, we have an official announcement video.</p> <!--more-->

<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," explains a press release. "12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realise they are far from being alone... As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth."</p>
<p>"Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight," it continues. "Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!" How would you react in this scenario? My first plan of action would be: find a gun, find a very large bag of crisps, find a corner, and sit in it.</p>
<p>The game will see you improvising weapons and making use of stealth mechanics, in addition to the usual Supermassive business of picking narrative and/or dialogue branches and realising you've just doomed everybody. The celebrity on the poster this time round is British actress Lashana Lynch, who plays Maria Rambeau in the Marvel Connected Universe. Good luck with the XenoThing, Lashana.</p>

            <p>This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> represents an attempt to course correct after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2</a>’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.</p>

<p>This one’s got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/">Steam page</a>, too. “A thrilling standalone zombie adventure set in a tightly-crafted rural region,” it says. There’s no release date yet, but it does feature four player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>. Here’s a few more details about the setting:</p>
<blockquote><p>This once-bustling tourist destination is home to a diminishing number of survivors and an increasing population of zombies. Featuring natural landmarks, small villages and industrial complexes, the setting offers diverse traversal options, whether it’s using your parkour skills to gain the upper hand on your enemies or hopping into an abandoned 4x4 to outrun the horrors of the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t 500 hours long. As a freelancer that would work out at about 30p an hour, but, more pertinent to you, there’s just not enough character to Dying Light 2 to hold your attention beyond a fleet-footed 30,” wrote Matthew (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-2-stay-human-review">his review.</a> “Come the real zombie apocalypse we should all be so lucky to face a world this trudgingly well behaved.” Hopefully The Beast will be a bit more feral, then.</p>

<p>Many people have grown tired of the zombie survival genre, even if it is innovative and offers eight-player cooperative gameplay. But I’m not! There are dozens of us still excited about zombie co-op games, right? Thanks to Gamescom, we now have a firsthand look at the eight-player co-op in No More Room in Hell 2.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 World Premiere Trailer | GAMESCOM Opening Night Live 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whQTi6RPsiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Straight off the bat, you can see how immersive the sequel appears. The setting, zombie designs, and combat appear more visceral and realistic, with tension and terror dominating the air. </p>



<p>While most zombie survival games opt for four players, which is the staple, No More Room in Hell 2 gameplay wants to turn the dial up to eleven and keep you on your toes with eight people joining the fight!</p>



<p>From melee combat to firearms to running for your life from a pursuing zombie, the new Gamescom trailer for No More Room in Hell 2 offered up a little bit of everything for those keeping a close eye on the game. We won’t have to wait long, thankfully, as the co-op survival horror launches later this year!</p>

<p>As long-time fans of the zombie survival genre and co-op games in general, Insider Gaming cannot wait to get its hands on No More Room in Hell 2!</p>

<p>Following a lengthy period of outright silence from developer Embark Studios, the team behind the upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter ARC Raiders finally brought us something new at Gamescom. We’ve seen leaked gameplay from the project, thanks to its 2023 playtest, but this showing was outright fantastic and certainly on the right track!</p>



<p>As part of their showing at Gamescom, ARC Raiders revealed an upcoming playtest coming this fall that should excite the gaming community. It’s been far too long since we had any information about the free-to-play PvPvE extraction shooter, and now a new cinematic trailer graces the stage. I don’t know about you, but my hype train is rapidly pulling out of the station!</p>



<p>You can check out the new trailer for yourself below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it’s clearly a cinematic and not gameplay, we do get a firsthand look at the game’s world-building and setting. It’s looking positively gorgeous, with so much detail spread throughout the environment. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they revealed a release window for ARC Raiders, coming 2025!</p>

<p>As long-time fans of the extraction shooter genre, Insider Gaming is eating well these next few months. ARC Raiders is shaping up to be a thrilling free-to-play extraction shooter, and from the looks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leaked gameplay</a>, we’re excited to see what the future holds!</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer shows us more fighters arriving for the game and some story cutscenes. We get to see characters from all Sagas featured in the newest trailer, with characters like Beerus, Bardock, Trunks, Hercule, Kefla and many more appearing during Gamescom’s opening night live.</p>



<p>Players also see iconic and new story cutscenes in the latest Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Gamescom trailer. One of the scenes included Goku training Teen Gohan to turn into a Super Saiyan in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. We also saw utterly new situations, such as adult Gohan taking on the likes of Goku Rose. </p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero releases on October 11, 2024 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. </p>



<p>In previous trailers, Bandai Namco revealed characters from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unveils-saiyan-namek-sagas-characters-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saiyan</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unveils-saiyan-namek-sagas-characters-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Namek</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-reveals-android-saga-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a> Sagas. After the latest trailer, only the Super Series characters remain in the main canon. Many also wonder if Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will include characters from the GT saga and the non-canon movies, as they were featured in previous Budokai Tenkaichi titles.&nbsp;Dragon Ball Sparking Zero releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam on October 11.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled for a release in 2024, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-delays-new-ip-lost-records-bloom-rage-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed to early 2025</a>. Developer Don’t Nod says that the game’s release was being moved to give the game more polish and avoid competition with the next title in the Life is Strange franchise.</p>



<p>“We know you’re all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine,” Don’t Nod said when announcing the delay in June. “The wait will be worth it!”</p>



<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Today, the company announced that its AI-powered system, ACE, will make its gaming debut next year. </p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light">— NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1825896986559512592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/mecha-break-nvidia-ace-nims-rtx-pc-laptop-games-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a>, Nvidia confirmed that Seasun Games' upcoming action project, Mecha BREAK, will be the first game to use this new AI-powered system. Nvidia ACE was revealed by Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang at Computex 2023, and will fuse gaming and AI in a new way by using generative AI (GenAI) in NPCs to make them more interactive than possible. </p><p>Nvidia notes in the blog post that thanks to ACE, Mecha BREAK players can "interact via natural language" with the in-game NPCs. In a demo provided by Nvidia, you can see ACE being shown off in Mecha BREAK; the NPCs will be able to "see gamers and identify people and objects in the real world" by using both your webcam as well as OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o large language model (LLM). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Interestingly, Nvidia revealed that Mecha BREAK would use Nvidia's Audio2Face-3D NIM and Whisper, along with OpenAI's auto-speech recognition model, to provide facial animation and speech recognition. Elevenlabs will power the characters' voices via the cloud. However, the video demo displayed the NPCs responding in a monotone voice. Of course, Mecha BREAK is not due until sometime next year, so there's time for the tech to be improved before the release day. </p><p>Alongside Seasun Games, Huang previously revealed last year that other game developers are currently "<a href="https://in.ign.com/tech/200206/news/nvidia-announces-ace-a-tech-that-allows-developers-to-use-lifelike-generative-ai-models-in-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embracing</a>" ACE, including miHoYo, NetEase Games, Tencent, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-and-mihoyo-nvidia-ace-ai-video-character-tool">Ubisoft</a>, to name a few.</p><p>Nvidia ACE is one of many AI-powered tools being offered to assist in game development. However, it is also one of the biggest talking points of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-officially-go-on-strike-over-ai-protections">ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game voice actors strike</a>. According to SAG-AFTRA, the main reason for the strike is that video game developers have not reached an agreement with actors over the regulation of GenAI in upcoming game projects.</p><p>Mecha BREAK will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

The sequel has been in various forms of development for nearly a decade.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It's therefore unusual that it would remove the game from the PlayStation Plus Games Catalog as it seemingly costs the studio nothing to include it.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-is-coming-to-the-playstation-plus-games-catalogue">Horizon: Forbidden West hit the service in February 21, 2023</a>, one year after it launched and exactly 18 months ago tomorrow, August 21, 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-pulling-horizon-zero-dawn-from-ps-plus-amid-ps5-remaster-rumors">Sony did the same thing with the first game in the franchise</a>, Horizon: Zero Dawn in May 2024, however. This happened amid rumors it planned on remastering the 2017 PlayStation 4 game, though no official word on this has emerged since.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Forbidden West PS5 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It would fit with Sony's recent trend though, as its lineup has been lacking major PS5 exclusives and is instead filled with remasters and remakes such as The Last of Us Part 1, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-on-ps5s-60-pricetag-reignites-remake-price-debate">Until Dawn</a>.</p><p>If Sony is planning to release a remastered version of Horizon: Zero Dawn, it would therefore make sense to remove both it and its sequel from the PlayStation Plus Games Catalog so fans would be inclined to purchase the full versions of both games instead of essentially renting them through the subscription service.</p><p>In our 9/10 review, IGN said: "A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>The leader of the Phantom Thieves is back and ready to steal more hearts. Well. Kind of. A new trailer for Persona 3 Reload's upcoming DLC, Episode Aigis, has revealed that Persona 5 protagonist Joker will be making an appearance in the upcoming expansion. However, rather than assisting the ragtag group of SEES members in their quest to break a grief-fueled time loop, he'll serve as an optional boss fight in the game's Challenge Battle mode.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isCe5hdYgGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/isCe5hdYgGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, not much is known about what Joker's boss fight will entail or why he's facing off against SEES in the first place. However, brief footage of the battle seems to indicate that it will be a pretty tough time, as Joker is bringing not only his A-game but his powerful Persona Arsene as well. In the press release announcing the crossover, Atlus wrote:</p><p>"Wholly unique to Persona 3 Reload's Episode Aigis, the encounter with the masked boy presents a hardcore challenge for players via a secret boss fight, replete with striking themes from Persona 5 Royal. The confrontation is one part of the larger Episode Aigis: The Answer content expansion, a major post-ending DLC that further develops the story of Persona 3 Reload and serves as a story epilogue."</p><p><span>Though the boss battle will be optional, we can't imagine passing on the opportunity to take on one of the Persona series' coolest characters. Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis is scheduled to release on September 10 and will be available on PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</span></p>

                <p>The Dark Pictures Anthology, Supermassive's long-running horror franchise of games that tend to play like interactive movies, is getting some major overhauls to its gameplay mechanics with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020/" data-ref-id="5000-577791">Directive 8020</a>, as revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. The next game in the series will be the first to be set in outer space and stars Lashana Lynch from Bob Marley: One Love and The Woman King.</p><p>Supermassive revealed a new trailer for the game during Gamescom Opening Night Live, that hinted at its story--a doomed spaceship, a crew of future victims, and an everpresent alien threat. It surely sounds like Alien, but that's surely on purpose too. The game's monster is also capable of disguising itself as other lifeforms, so there's even a wrinkle of The Thing here.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_7LbFQJNs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jQ_7LbFQJNs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>But what's most notable is how Directive 8020 will build on the game's traditional mechanics of exploration, decision-making, and forming relationships with other characters that impact the story. Though these elements remain intact for the movie-like game, new twists have been revealed, too. This includes the way the monster poses a "real-time" threat, which seems to call back to Alien: Isolation's way of having the monster almost constantly able to leap into any moment of the game and eat you alive.</p><p>New stealth gameplay and improvised weaponry will further separate it from past games in the horror anthology, and because the creature (or is it <em>creatures</em>?) can shape-shift, your decision-making will be tested more than ever before, as you may align yourself with a monster in disguise.</p><p>Directive 8020 is scheduled to arrive in 2025 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It marks the fifth game in a series that seems to have intentions to make eight or more games before it concludes. Tragically, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-curator-tony-pankhurst-has-died/1100-6525365/" data-ref-id="1100-6525365">the actor who portrays the series' Cryptkeeper-like host recently passed</a>.</p>

                <p>Tarsier Studios, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel, has revealed Reanimal during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. With Little Nightmares 3 coming from Supermassive, the series' original creators have shifted into a new, but similarly macabre, horror universe.</p><p>Reanimal is designed for two-player co-op, and can be played online or locally. In fact, if you do play it solo, you'll bring an AI companion with you every step of the way through its unsettling, violent world. Reanimal features giant monsters that resemble animals such as sheep, pigs, and... well, some that are a bit harder to define.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1YLoXtb-80" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E1YLoXtb-80" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the reveal trailer shows, the presentation and gameplay closely resemble Little Nightmares. The game is a cinematic platformer in which puzzles and enemies routinely stand between the player and salvation.</p><p>Reanimal has no announced release date as of yet, but it's set to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>
Dying Light developer Techland has shown off a new game in its zombie series that began life as a DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a>.
</p>
<p>
Announced during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-time-where-to-watch">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live, Dying Light: The Beast is a solo or four-player co-op experience pitched as a "tight" 18-hour ride through a fresh area of the franchise's world. 
</p>
<p>
Dying Light protagonist Kyle Crane, once again voiced by Roger Craig Smith, returns here, a decade on. In-game, Crane has been in captivity, and experimented on. The upside? You have zombie DNA powers to unleash that beast on enemies.

<p>
"Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human," Techland wrote in a press release. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience.
</p>
<p>
"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a launch window yet, but it'll land for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.
