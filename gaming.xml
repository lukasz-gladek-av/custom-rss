            <p>Lo, a ripple in the release date sands. Stand still a moment while we study this phenomenon. Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.</p>

<p>The trailer aired during Gamescom's advertising bonanza, Opening Night Live. It takes us swiftly through a new player's idealised opening experience, during which they're dumped in the desert but find another player to team up with. "Working with others will always increase your chances of staying alive," say developers Funcom (they've never <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">played Chained Together with Edwin and Nic</a>). There's a fair bit of ornithopter flying, which looks like quite a buzz.</p>
<p>As expected, much else of what we see is in keeping with Dune's lore. There are body shields and sand worms and those wibbly hoverpacks I don't know the name of. You even suck up all the blood from your enemies and put it in a machine to extract drinking water. (Mostly, I like that you can sell the blueprints of your finished buildings to other players for cash, but this feels like the least Dune-y thing in the whole trailer). You'll also get to meet known characters from the fiction such as famous protagonist <del>Duniel Baggins</del> Paul Atreides. </p>
<p>We've previously heard from developers Funcom that it plays fast and loose with the source material in some important ways, though. Paul's father is alive and well, for example, counter to the canon. Even the environment will see some changes. "The Dune in the movie shows no natural vegetation whatsoever," said Tech Art Director Richard Cawte in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/developer-update-1-art-of-arrakis">a blog update</a>, "which is not the case for our Dune." Plants!? On Arrakis!? My outrage better be coming across as fake!! Because it is!!! I like plants!!!!</p>
<p>Edwin got an early look at the crafty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> and came away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">"surprisingly enthused"</a>. Funcom have previously made similar multiplayer survive-o-crafts with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> and have been in the sci-fi MMO business since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-anarchy-online">Anarchy Online</a>, so it makes sense that they were chosen to grip the reins of this particularly large franchiseworm. </p>
<p>There's an ongoing beta that you can still sign up for on <a href="https://www.duneawakening.com/#">the game's website</a> if you're so inclined. For everyone else, time to squat in the sand and look at the horizon thoughtfully for 5-6 months. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;is all set to immerse players in the medieval machinations of warring kings and lords all over again, when it comes out on 11th February 2025.</p>
<p>We’ve played a few hours of the game, experiencing its opening narrative twists, as well as leaping ahead to the big city of Kuttenberg and the broader historical RPG action – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">you can read all about that here</a> – but we also got to sit down with Warhorse figurehead and PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling to talk about a game that’s been a whole console generation in the making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwywU6b_JKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><b>TSA: </b>It’s going to have been 7 years almost exactly between games, which is basically a full console generation which is a lot of time in terms of tech, gaming and people’s attitudes. As a developer, has your approach for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 changed compared to the original, beyond the studio simply getting so much bigger?</p>
<p><b>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </b>Yes and no. No, it’s still very much the same kind of game, so we’re trying to stay true to Warhorse, stay true to KCD, and deliver what we believe is a true, authentic medieval experience, but then again, now with more people and the cushion of a successful KCD1, we can make things bigger –&nbsp;everyone always says it’s going to be bigger and better, but in our case we do have more people, we have the financial funding that can support the development, but we also have the technology and the skills now to bring stuff into the game that we couldn’t afford before.</p>

<p>For example, we and [Director] Daniel Vávra always wanted to have a city in the game, and in KCD1 they’re teasing and talking about how in Kuttenberg something is happening, but we simply couldn’t [go there], because we weren’t able to have more than a few people on screen, the task of building a huge medieval city was too big, and so in KCD1 we basically have a bunch of villages and one overblown village, which is Rattay. Compare Ratai to KCD2 and it’s like one street in Kuttenberg. Now we are confident to tackle bigger things and that is what I think has changed most.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>You’ve almost already answered my next question, which is what ways KCD2 has changed from the original? The scope, of course, but are you sticking with the alchemy system, the style of combat and things like that?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, the scope is the easy answer, but pretty much every element from KCD1 is being tweaked, fine tuned and upgraded. Even the dice minigame will be deeper and there will be some badges you can earn.</p>
<p>I think the most prominent example is with the combat […] We said of KCD1 that combat was easy to learn but hard to master, and I think the hard to master we nailed, but the easy to learn, not so much. Many people liked it, but some struggled, so the idea now is to have different animators come to the studio so that they all feel different, but they ca also offer different playstyle. So if you want to play the intricate combat system, then you can take a sword and do all the combos and moves, but if you’re a character that doesn’t want to combat at all or want a more straightforward style, then there’s weapons like the mace where you pretty much just whack the opponent on the head!</p>
<p>Then in the UI there are less attacking zones, it’s a bit more straightforward, the combos are not so difficult, and so on. It’s also stayed true to each weapon historically and what it was used for –&nbsp;of course the crossbow was easier than a bow, that’s why they invented them, and of course a pole weapon is easier that fencing, that’s why they used them. The intent is for a more entertaining game that offers you this choice.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>You mentioned hitting enemies on the head, and video game developers have got a rich tradition of exploding watermelons. Usually it’s for first person shooters, I think, but did you get through many watermelons during development?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>[laughs] I don’t want to spoil too much, but many watermelons were harmed!</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>It also feels like you’re taking a step forward in the storytelling and the cinematic stylings. Perhaps a lot of that is from experiencing the opening hours and getting people into the setting, but does that continue as the open world is exposed to you?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b> Daniel Vávra is a huge cinematics fan, and one day wants to shoot a film himself, so of course you can see this in his games –&nbsp;you can also see this in Mafia and Mafia 2, his earlier products. He has this hand for dramatic scenes and sequences, and KCD 2 especially is not different.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, it’s a little bit more hands on and we bring you up to speed with the video sequences to introduce you to the game and the surroundings. This will be less through the rest of the game, however, I think we have 4, 5 or 6 hours of cinematics in the game, and they’re extremely powerful and important for us to deliver the story. We have a 100 hour game, after all, and it’s a story driven game first, and an action RPG and the fighting and so on, so therefore the cinematics are very important.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I like that you can really put Henry and Sir Hans together as two characters that have a lot of growing up to do in this game.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>And that’s what makes them so lovely! Hans Capon in the first game, if you check on Reddit and so on, most people are saying the same: “I hated this dude in the beginning, but then he became my most loved character!”</p>
<p>He had this interest arc in KCD where he became a friend to Henry, but still there’s the difference where he is a noble and Henry is a Squire, a bastard. This is still present, but KCD2 will focus strongly on the bromance between those two, as they face terrible situations through the game where they’re on the edge of surviving (maybe even further), and that’s a dramatic part that we have a big focus on.</p>
<p>Henry, in KCD1, pretty much solved everything by himself, but in KCD2 that will not be the case. He will find out very quickly that he needs friends and he needs other misfits to get things done.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I get the feeling that Hans would like Henry to still sort everything out for them! [laughs]
</p><p>How important is that you kept Mutt in the game? Was that a day one addition to the plan?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, and you can finally pet him! That was a big thing and even our own guys said we have to have a pettable dog, and to go one further, we have a petable horse as well, which is great.</p>
<p>Some of the perks and stats we are taking over to KCD 2, like the dog for instance or Henry being able to read –&nbsp;it doesn’t make sense to make him learn to read all over again –&nbsp;however, things like combat and other intricate things, he has to rediscover.</p>
<p>I like to say it’s like he’s the champion of a Sunday league, but now he’s going to the Premier League, so he will suck at most things in comparison. However, he now knows how to play soccer, but now needs to step up the game to deal with armies, knights, lords, nobility and so on. It’s not like he forgot everything, it’s more like he needs to refine his skills.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>He didn’t just take a mace to the head and forget stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Exactly.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>There’s obviously still areas that you might still be able to improve and add in future, so you talked about not having jousting in the game, which I’m sure a lot of people would be nagging you to do. Is that the main thing that is still on the wish list?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Honestly, I think everything that’s in the game and everything that’s not in the game is exactly as intended by Warhorse – this is how we do it, this is what we wanted to deliver, and we are looking forward to getting this out.</p>
<p>Jousting and these things are coming from fans that are very often used to Hollywood scenes, like A Knight’s Tale. Yes, jousting was a thing in the Middle Ages, but it definitely wasn’t as present as people might think…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Also, it was probably just for the rich folks.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>For the <em>very</em> rich folks. For the nobility mainly, and even then, when they were participating, it was a problem because you were actually hurting a nobleman!</p>
<p>But there will be tournaments: swordfighting tournaments, archery tournaments, horse tournaments and so on and so on. There will be cool stuff in there, but jousting would be a bit like a Quidditch game for Harry Potter. Of course everyone wanted Quidditch in there, but…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I mean, jousting you can understand, but Quidditch is impossible to figure out how to make into a workable game!</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Just catch the golden ball! [laughs]
</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Lastly, I was wondering about big picture for Kingdom Come. Obviously you will tell a story of its own in KCD2, but is there still another chapter in a grander saga? I’m not sure you’re allowed to say right now…</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>I’m allowed to say anything! KCD1 ended with a cliffhanger, and KCD2 will end a story, but I don’t tell you which story. What the future brings, we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>In our history at Warhorse, we had two sink or swim situations. One was the Kickstarter, and the other was the release of KCD, because even then we weren’t sure if it would be a success or not. it’s not a sink or swim situation anymore, knocking on wood, but we have to wait and see how KCD2 performs. I am positive, I think the game is great and in very good shape already.</p>
<p>I can tell you already that Warhorse tries to aim to get bigger. We want more people, have bigger studios and again tackle bigger challenges.</p>

<p><em>Our hands on time and chat with Tobi with Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 came thanks to a press trip to Kutná Hora, the modern day Kuttenberg, with travel and accommodation provided by Warhorse and Plaion.</em></p>

		<p>Supermassive Games have revealed the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology and, as we found out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/01/next-dark-pictures-anthology-game/">quite a while ago,</a> it’s called Directive 8020. This time we are off into space for some body horror, checkout the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Directive 8020 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXhOhzbXso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I don’t think Supermassive would mind us saying that The Dark Pictures Anthology format had got a little stale after four games so it’s nice to see they are switching things up for this new release. “In a dramatic step forward for the series, the game features persistent real-time threats, all-new stealth gameplay mechanics, and enhanced interactive cinematics powered by Unreal Engine 5,” they say.</p>
<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King. Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>
<p>“Earth is <span>dying</span>&nbsp;and humanity is running out of time. 12&nbsp;<span>light</span> years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>

<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror&nbsp;</strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats&nbsp;</strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-console-anti-cheat/</link>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team just addressed a whole host of topics about the game at Gamescom, talking exclusively to media about upcoming changes and additional features. The team spoke at length about the full release of the game, which is expected to arrive later this year, and touched on some recent controversies, such as the game’s ‘pay-to-win’ model.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-breakout">Prepare to Breakout</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite is now in early access, and some players were quick to find issues with the game’s operating model. For instance, accusations have been lobbied at MoreFun for promoting a pay-to-win model by stuffing certain items behind paywalls, but this was one of the key areas addressed by the team at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Speaking on the topic, Enzo Zhang, the Head of MoreFun Studios, said that all microtransactions are cosmetic-focused and that a battle pass structure is coming soon. He mentioned that users <strong>can </strong>access everything in-game, and as the title isn’t inherently ‘grindy’, it’s relatively easy to do.</p>



<p>Users can of course buy in-game currency, but the team is stressing that the game isn’t pay-to-win.</p>



<p>Touching on other popular topics, MoreFun explained that there is a console release planned for the game, and while it’ll be the same experience, it won’t be crossplay-compatible. That means that PC players won’t be able to interact with console players.</p>



<p>There are also no plans to introduce a PvE or ‘offline’ mode, despite the team working on innovative AI systems that would perfectly facilitate such a platform. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, MoreFun is working on better engagement with the community. It’s kicking off a ‘support-a-streamer’ program, introducing streamer items, streamer <strong>codes</strong>, and a creator program to support those who want to broadcast their gameplay on the likes of Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>By the end of the year, Arena Breakout: Infinite will have a new map (TV Station), more weapons, game modes, and the first female operator. The team is also hard at work on intense anti-cheat mechanics, working on automated solutions, manual mechanics, and better encryption.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there’s one hell of a roadmap lined up for Arena Breakout: Infinite, which is poised to fully disrupt the extraction shooter genre with reckless abandon. As the team said, it’s designed as an ‘extraction shooter for everyone’, and it’ll allow users to dip in and out as they please without feeling like they’re being penalised for taking time away from the game.</p>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite just entered early access but is expected to launch as a full game later this year. It’s breaking heavily into the extraction shooter market, which is admittedly becoming quite a densely populated landscape, but it’s coming with quite a bit of innovation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the team at MoreFun Studios is working on an innovative AI solution known as ‘FACUL’, which stands for First Ever AI Companion Who Understands Human Language.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-level-intelligence">Next-Level Intelligence</h2>



<p>MoreFun Studios is working to constantly pump Arena Breakout: Infinite, a new free-to-play extraction shooter, with content. On the roadmap is the integration of a next-generation artificial intelligence engine called FACUL, which will allow players to make use of AI-powered companions that they can order around the battlefield.</p>



<p>But it’s far from the command model that existed 20 years ago in the likes of SOCOM.</p>



<p>FACUL allows AI characters to recognise up to 17,000 in-game items, such as buildings, weapons, landmarks, and as the team said, ‘even blades of grass’. Players can use an adaptive, dynamic model to issue commands to these AI companions, ordering them as though they were talking to teammates. They can even have casual conversations and crack jokes with the AI.</p>



<p>MoreFun admitted that it hasn’t found a real use case for the AI in the game, particularly as it’s trying to avoid implementing something that could become quite overpowered, but it’s an innovative and interesting feature that’s being penned as a first-ever for the FPS genre.</p>

            <p>Hyper Light Breaker - Heart Machine's fully 3D rogue-lite spin on its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - has had its early access launch bumped back a bit, and is now targeting an early 2025 release.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/5989310788331688818">Steam</a>, Heart Machine founder Alx Preston said the team needs a bit more time to ensure the gameplay experience is up to the "polished" standard the studio is aiming for.</p>
<p>"We don't want to ship a project, even in Early Access, that we're not satisfied with on a number of fronts. Especially in the current state of the industry, we need to put as good a foot forward as we can," Preston wrote.</p>

<p>The developer said the studio also wanted to ensure the wellbeing of its staff, with their mental and physical health a priority. This delay, Preston said, will "enable the team to offer better, more responsive support to community feedback during the Early Access period itself", rather than seeing them burnt out having pushed for that earlier launch.</p>
<p>"Trust that we REALLY want to put Breaker out there, and see people engage with a game that we've all worked so hard on," Preston assured the community. "However, we also REALLY need to make sure that the core foundational units of the game are as strong as they can be, so that we can build on them during the Early Access period."</p>

<p>Hyper Light Breaker was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-is-getting-a-fully-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-with-online-co-op">announced back in March 2022</a>, with an expected launch into early access the following spring. Its release then shifted to autumn 2023 before it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifters-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-gets-first-gameplay-trailer">pushed back to 2024</a>. As with this latest delay, Heart Machine said it wanted to make sure it could "bring the game to its full potential" ahead of its debut.</p>
<p>In the meantime while waiting for Hyper Light Breaker, you can give Hyper Light Drifter a whirl if you are yet to do so. "Heart Machine's slash-'em-up is punishing and precise - and incredibly beautiful," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-review">Eurogamer's Hyper Light Drifter review</a> from 2016.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a new stand alone game that brings back Kyle Crane from the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light/">Dying Light</a> game and it’s DLC. Kyle was absent from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2,</a> probably because at the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-following/">The Following</a> players could experience two different endings and neither of them were particularly… healthy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is set thirteen years since Kyle was last seen and finds him exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a once-popular tourist destination. The area is populated with human factions as well as monsters including “the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.”</p>
<p>As you might have gathered Kylie is no longer fully human. “Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power,” say Techland. “It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.”</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith will be returning to the role of Kyle Crane. “Stepping back into Kyle Crane’s shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend,” Smith said. “And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>

<p>The extra nice news is that if you own &nbsp;Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition you will get The Beast for free!</p>
<p>“Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human. But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience,” say Techland. “To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC.”</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beas coming to to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox and PlayStation – and that includes last gen&nbsp; – but no release date has been given.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's about to kick off in the centre of Kuttenberg, the sprawling medieval city at the heart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Menhard the sword master has offered to teach protagonist Henry of Skalitz a few tricks with the blade, but the lesson has been interrupted by Kuttenberg's official fencing guild. They won't let Menhard teach so much as a pommel strike, despite him having a charter from King Wenceslas to do just that. Moreover, they're going to fine the old Fechtmeister for breaching their rules.</p><p>Things are getting heated, with the chance of a real swordfight breaking out growing by the second. But Henry has an idea. "Menhard wasn't teaching me anything," he blurts out. "We were duelling because I insulted his honour!" </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Unconvinced, the guild master asks what the duel was about, at which point I'm given an array of choices for Henry to respond with. Reacting quickly, I decide to have Henry say that he slept with Menhard's daughter. I don't know whether Menhard has a daughter, but it seems like the sort of thing medieval people would get into a duel over, so I roll with it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The guild master buys my bald-faced lie and waives the fine...</p></div><p>It works. The guild master buys my bald-faced lie and waives the fine, though Menhard is still prohibited from teaching longsword in the city. With a fight avoided, I turn to Menhard expecting him to be grateful. Instead, he's furious. It seems Menhard really does have a daughter, and the very idea of Henry sleeping with her has genuinely insulted his honour. Oops. With their relationship damaged, Henry must desperately placate the raging swordmaster before they can focus on more important matters, like plotting how to get back at Kuttenberg's fencing guild.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is shaping up to be an even bigger RPG than the original, a 100+ hour epic featuring massive battles, sweeping Bohemian landscapes, and a fully simulated medieval metropolis. But at Warhorse Studios' preview event hosted in the real-life city of Kutná Hora (the modern Czech name for Kuttenberg) it was this throwaway detail that stuck with me the most. Warhorse claims every choice the player makes in its RPG will feel like it matters, and this dramatic response to a decision I barely thought about was the first (but not the last) indicator that KCD2 could well deliver on this promise. </p><p>It'll be several hours before KCD 2 opens-up to you in this way, however. Warhorse provided access to two separate chunks of the game, the first of which took place right at the beginning. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 opens in medias res, with an explosive castle siege where you defend the ramparts with crossbow and longsword. Warhorse says KCD 2 will feature substantially larger battles than the previous game, and this initial sequence was an impressive taster of playing at a larger scale, from booting down siege ladders from the castle wall, to firing crossbow bolts into a crush of enemy soldiers as they come barrelling through the gate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Following this exciting opening, KCD 2 rewinds to connect with the end of the first game, as we rejoin Henry and his friend and liege lord Sir Hans Capon on a mission to deliver a letter to neighbouring lord Otto von Bergow. This initial hour is strictly linear and heavy on cutscenes, but it keeps you engaged through the feelgood vibes of Henry and Hans' friendship. Like the first Kingdom Come, the sequel is written in a very humanistic style. Henry remains a deeply affable, fish-out-of-water protagonist, while his position as Sir Hans' squire leads to an interesting blend of camaraderie and tension between the two.</p><p>Together, the pair have big "lads on tour" energy, clearly revelling in the rare freedom their position and assignment affords them in medieval society. It isn't all fun and games, however. An encounter with a retinue of Bergow's knights emphasises the danger that lurks around every corner, as the two have to convince the armed horsemen that they aren't bandits. It's the first of many elaborate dialogue sequences, with numerous player choices and a lot of exposition. Indeed, while KCD's conversations are generally interesting, I did wonder if they might benefit from some sterner editing at times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>KCD2 is built to be played with no foreknowledge of the original. As such, the opening hours fold in several refresher tutorials, such as Henry and Hans having a friendly duel that reintroduces you to KCD's unique swordfighting system. This has been refined for the sequel, reducing the number of directions you can swing your sword from five to four, and making actions like parrying and riposting easier to pull off. While it's been years since I played the first game, I was nonetheless able to hold my own against Sir Hans after a few minutes of instruction, suggesting that Warhorse's changes have indeed made the system easier to grapple with. The sequel also introduces bespoke fighting systems for certain non-sword weapons like maces, letting players who don't fancy mastering the blade to adopt the simpler approach of cracking skulls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>KCD2 is built to be played with no foreknowledge of the original.</p></div><p>The introduction culminates in Henry and Hans taking a bath in the river, followed by a goofy scene where they sneak through the reeds along the riverbank, drawn by the sound of peasant women singing nearby. The scene quickly takes a darker turn, however, as the pair's camp is attacked by bandits, whereupon they're forced to flee into the woods wearing nothing but their pants. It's a sequence that shifts between dramatic and comedic multiple times, and the game handles those tonal changes well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Through a series of unfortunate events, Henry and Hans end up in the care of a local peasant woman, where we get a chance to see the quieter side of KCD2. One of the original’s strengths was how it strived to immerse players in moment-to-moment play, and KCD2 seems just as indulgent in this regard. Simple actions like eating stew from a pot and picking herbs to make potions are depicted with intensely detailed first-person animations, while the Bohemian forests you explore are verdant and alive with birdsong. There's a chance to experiment with the updated alchemy system, which is even more tactile and involved than the first game, with you sprinkling ingredients into a big cauldron, before adjusting its height with a lever to change the heat level. Later, when Henry has to fight and kill a couple of bandits who come looking for him, an optional objective unlocks to bury the bodies away from the peasant woman's home, and you can go through the entire process of putting these wayward souls to rest.</p><p>Everything in this initial demo suggests KCD 2 will retain the original’s capacity for letting players steep in its medieval setting. What it didn't show was anything wildly new. For this, the second demo was more promising. This fast-forwarded the campaign to the 50-hour mark, where Henry arrives in Kuttenberg. This medieval metropolis is the largest urban space seen in the series yet, a bustling environment where every NPC has their own daily routines and behaviours.</p><p>It's here where Henry encounters the swordmaster Menhard and becomes embroiled in the dispute over who has the rights to teach longsword in the city. To settle the disagreement, Menhard hatches a plan, and asks Henry to steal the fencing guild's official sword and hang it on the wall of the Rathaus (the town hall). This, Menhard explains, is the formal way of issuing a challenge of arms to the town, a challenge which Menhard could then accept to prove his martial superiority.</p><p>Of course, this means sneaking into a guildhall filled with master swordsmen, which Menhard wisely suggests you do at night (though you are free to try it in the daytime if you wish). Yet even in darkness, clandestine activities are a risky business in Kuttenberg. Anyone walking around at night is expected to carry a torch, and not doing so will get you in trouble with the guards. Having successfully evaded the city watch, I then have to climb over the wall of the guild house, pick the lock on one of several potential entrances, find the sword, and escape. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here, the open-ended nature of KCD 2 becomes much more apparent, with the quest feeling closer in spirit to a game like Dishonored than the more directed sequences of the early game. The first time I attempt the theft, things go south quickly. I pick the lock but attract the attention of one of the nightwatchmen, who relocks the door after searching for me. I pick the lock again, and proceed three steps into the building before I'm rumbled. I try to fight my way out with fisticuffs, managing to knock out one of the nightwatchmen, but another has roused the town guard, who come barrelling in with swords drawn to quickly cut me down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The quest can alter in multiple ways depending on your actions, both in narrative choices and general play.</p></div><p>In my second attempt, I'm more careful, and succeed in lifting the sword unnoticed and hanging it on the wall of the Rathaus. This would be a natural endpoint for the quest, but it proves to be far from over. Succeeding in the theft leads to a multi-stage longsword tournament between Menhard and the swordmasters' guild, and you can choose to be sworn in under Menhard's stewardship and fight for his honour and right to teach longsword in the city. Moreover, the quest can alter in multiple ways depending on your actions, both in narrative choices and general play. If you steal the sword but are spotted doing so, for example, the guild will accuse you of the theft when Menhard accepts their challenge. Consequently, the swordmasters' guild is given heavier armour during the tournament, making the fight more difficult on your end.</p><p>This elaborate structure isn't entirely surprising; quest design was one of the first game's strengths too. Nonetheless, it certainly feels like the sequel is operating at a higher level amid the busy streets of Kuttenberg. And if Menhard's quest is reflective of the sequel's 100+ hour total, then Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 could end up being something rather special indeed.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Seven years is a long time to wait after a cliffhanger ending, but as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> ably proves, it takes a good long time to make a game, these days. Warhorse Studios found great success with the first game, selling millions of copies to allow them to grow both in their ambitions and as a studio. Picking up right where the last game ended, the adventure that awaits Sir Hans and Henry is bigger, more deadly, and will take you from the countryside and into the big city.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwywU6b_JKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Spending several hours with the game, we got to experience the opening region and the events that kick this new narrative arc into gear, before jumping ahead to the big city and some of the politicking and possibilities that this region provides. There’s a pretty stark contrast between the two, most notably in terms of the environment that you’re exploring, but also in terms of pacing.</p>


<p>Dubbed ‘Bohemian Paradise’, the opening area is full of lush greenery and small villages surrounding the hilltop Trosky Castle, but we had only a glimpse of this amidst the narrative upheaval that greets Henry and his lord Sir Hans. They have been entrusted with delivering a message of peace to Lord Bergow, though as they get close, they’re greeted with suspicion and hostility from guards on patrol. There’s bandits in the area and they’re immediately suspicious of you, not least because of the respective allegiances in the war between King Wenceslas and the upstart King Sigismund.</p>
<p>That initial interaction starts to define who your version of Henry is. This is a fresh start from the first game, and Warhorse Studios describe it as a new arc – KCD was Henry becoming a man, while KCD 2 will be him becoming a warrior, but still seeking revenge for the murder of his parents, like he’s starring in a Shenmue game. Seeking to back Sir Hans up and express the honourable nature of our mission, I put my foot in it while trying to navigate the conversation with the guard’s captain, until Sir Hans steps back in and resolves the issue – of course, I doubt you can really start a fight at this point, but it lets you emphasise whether Henry will be a smooth-talking envoy or a strong, battling soldier that will fight to resolve issues, rather than talk too much.</p>


<p>You never make it to the castle, though, those aforementioned bandits ambushing your group and sending Sir Hans and Henry fleeing through the woods with just a pair of britches to hide their modesty. Thankfully the old lady who eventually takes them in, all battered, bruised and bleeding, doesn’t mind their lack of clothing, but once you actually reach Trosky, reality bites hard at Sir Hans, the brattier side to his summery character driving a wedge between the two. Also, you’ve got to go and find your dog, who went missing after the ambush.</p>
<p>It’s a compelling opening hour or so, giving a rather linear introduction to this game, providing you with some fighting practice, a bit of stealth, and revisiting a few of the key plot points via flashbacks, so you can enjoy this and understand Henry’s origins without having played the first game. However, it’s not a true representation of the more than 80 hours that will follow. That will be much more open and free for you to explore as you see fit, with gameplay and quest design that builds upon the style of the original. It’s when we leap ahead to explore Kuttenberg (now known as Kutná Hora in Czech) that we get to see this side of the game play out.</p>
<p>One of the most important cities within Bohemia at the time, Kuttenberg’s reputation was largely built on the silver mines that gave it so much wealth. This was a major economic centre because of it, with a minting press clanging away to produce currency, and people drawn to the area because of this.</p>

<p>Kuttenberg has been recreated in fantastic detail here, with Warhorse getting a lot of support from the city to help them build something authentic to the period. Leaning upon historical references and records, they’re able to peel back the centuries and restore buildings and structures back to what they would have been like – a walking tour through the city lets us see the comparison between the modern and preserved streets and structures, and how they look in the game, as well as educated guesses like an astronomical clock that they know was there, but have modelled after the world famous clock in Prague. While you might have a mental image of a world filled with muddy browns, Kuttenberg’s wealth was shown through colour, artistic construction and finery.</p>
<p>And naturally, with a large population centre, politics come to the fore and create conflict. Menhardt the master swordsman –&nbsp;a Fechter –&nbsp;has come from Frankfurt with a license from the king to found a brotherhood and spread his artistry in combat. But as he arrives in Kuttenberg, he finds another brotherhood from Prague has established itself, and the city council siding with them. All Menhardt wants –&nbsp;you’ll gather from his mixed English and German dialogue (in that Hollywood way that people never actually speak in when using foreign languages)&nbsp;– is the opportunity to fight and prove that he should be allowed to establish a brotherhood, but as they refuse to fight him, he hatches a plan with Henry to steal the Kuttenberg Sword from the local brotherhood and place it at the town hall to open them up to challenges.</p>

<p>There’s bound to be a bunch of ways to pull this off, but by far the easiest and most obvious is to sneak into the brotherhood’s house at night and steal the sword – people have routines through a 24-hour cycle, so you can skip forward to get to the point in time that you need. Nighttime is dictated by rules like needing to walk with a lamp or torch, so that you are above suspicion of being a thief, but you’ll encounter locked doors that need careful (and most importantly quiet) picking with a tricky, but enjoyable minigame, that can alert the people inside. Thankfully, if you are caught, then there’s still a way to trigger the duel and competition, just with the odds in the tournament being stacked against Menhardt and his brotherhood that you can join up to.</p>
<p>There’s been some significant improvements to the combat in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, though it’s building on the same foundations as the original game. You still have the five-pointed star reticule when fighting an opponent, giving you the ability to attack and block from either side, from above, jab down the middle or attack from below – these upward swings are now combined instead of being separate directions. I found it a little easier to grasp the basics in this game than with the first, learning a bit better how to parry and open an opponent’s guard, or to string together a flurry of blows. Don’t get cocky, though, because this is still a tricky style of combat to master.</p>
<p>Is there that much of a difference between Menhardt’s German school of combat and the Prague brotherhood? I couldn’t really say, but with their success and growth over the past seven years, Warhorse has grown the animation team from basically a single person, to having someone dedicated to each weapon and combat style. There should be greater distinction and nuance between them, letting your specialise.</p>
<p>But maybe you don’t want to be up close and personal? Fighting from afar will be perfectly viable, and maybe even preferred when the pitched battles can be much larger and more grand than before. You’ll see full-blown castle assaults, man the ramparts with a crossbow in hand, as opposed to a bow and arrow, and KCD2 will feature the earliest of firearms, including boom sticks that are basically a tube on a stick that you shove gunpowder and a bullet down, before making it go… well… boom!</p>

<p>There’s plenty more aspects to the game, all building upon the original, such as the public perception of Henry which shifts depending on your actions – so if you’re a thief, you’ll be branded as such and treated as one –&nbsp;or the in-depth alchemy system that has you physically mixing healing remedies. Oh, and of course there’s a fun game to sink your time into, though in this case it’s a historically accurate game of dice. It’s actually surprisingly addictive –&nbsp;well, I had to keep playing if I wanted my dog to have a sausage for dinner! –&nbsp;as you roll a bunch of dice and try to find pairs and runs with which you can score points and then keep rolling, but you importantly need to know when to quit, otherwise you’ll end up with no points for a round.</p>
<p>Put it all together and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.</p>
<p><em>Our hands on time with Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 came thanks to a press trip to Kutná Hora, the modern day Kuttenberg, with travel and accommodation provided by Warhorse and Plaion.</em></p>

			<p>It feels insane that I wrote a<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hands-on preview</a> of Kingdom Come: Deliverance seven years ago, following a trip to Hever Castle. It's not insane that I wrote the preview; I was interested in Kingdom Come: Deliverance for quite a while. What is insane is that it was seven years ago. Time flies.</p>
<p>As you now know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is getting a release on its seventh anniversary</a>. In addition, we know other aspects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more accessible combat</a> and an increased size and scale of the game. Having recently had a hands-on with the game in Kutna Hora, formerly known as Kuttenberg, I'm able to talk about some of these changes and what it bodes for the full release.</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics. <a href="https://warhorsestudios.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhorse Studios</a> has designed Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 so anybody can jump in. You don't need to have played the first game to be able to play and understand the second, despite it being a direct continuation. At the end of the first game, you - with Hans Capon - are riding into a forest on a mission to deliver a message. This starts as you exit that forest mere days later and are on the Bohemian Paradise map, the first of two.</p>

</figure>


<p>This marks the first part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and is the first of two hands-on sessions I had with the game while in Kuttenberg. With such a direct link, mere days between the first and second game, you would naturally wonder how they will work in what will essentially be a resetting of abilities and taking Henry back to basics, at least the basics for starting any game. In this case, you are badly injured in an ambush, which puts you back to basics.</p>
<p>Not everything is lost; Henry learned how to read and write in the first game, and this isn't a case of complete amnesia. Skills that Henry learned as part of the story remain, but if you played the first and you maxed everything out, you became the bohemian version of Connor MacLeod; you won't be that here. You may find it easier to progress here because the changes made by Warhorse Studios have greatly improved certain game elements.</p>
<p>Before discussing that, let's cover the basics without giving too many spoilers. Yes, the reset is due to an ambush of you and Hans Capon, and from what I have seen in the initial part of the story, the aim will be to complete the mission you were initially there for. You're there to deliver your message to Trosky castle, but in that ambush, you have lost everything, and naturally, the only sign of being there were seals to prove who you were, all lost. It's time to work your way up. In my first few hours, seeing how the game brought you either into - or back into - the world was interesting. I would argue that it is more than welcoming to new people, as it organically introduces you to several mechanics.</p>

<p>The second gameplay session I had put me later in the game, in Kuttenberg itself, gave an excellent example of how certain quests could change and how choices - and even the inability to do something - can have consequences as questlines go on. I won't go into the full details of it, but this quest puts you in the middle of two factions looking to run a sword-fighting training school. During the quest, you'll have a few routes to progress. I tried the sneaky route, stealing an item, but I was spotted, which resulted in a penalty on my side in a tournament.</p>
<p>What I will say from this is just how big Kuttenberg is. Sasau, with the monastery, is the most significant area in the first game. Kuttenberg, in this, is considerably larger. With its bustling nature, roaming around the city makes it feel alive. Initial impressions make it seem that Warhorse has been successful in making Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on a much grander scale in all ways, from the variety of quests, the size of the world, and also the themes it follows. The original was already a more mature title than most, with the aim for this being even more so.</p>
<p>This also applies to the dialogue. Games and other media often consider "mature" just a fair amount of swearing and some unnecessary and out-of-place sex. The swearing is still present from the four-plus hours I've had with the game. Still, the dialogue feels fantastic, and character development certainly feels strong, with a particular note to the conversations between Henry and Hans. Even the other conversations I've seen feel more natural.</p>
<p>Dramatically improved animations further enhance it. Including motion capture on faces adds to the immersion of these conversations and the game, with a much-improved overall visual quality and added animations throughout. Combat also looks smoother, with an increased variety of weapons and improved unarmed combat with further actions on how you're punching during your bar fights.</p>
<figure>

<p>In addition to the improvements in combat animations, the fluidity of combat works better. Having recently replayed the original, the sequel is certainly more accessible. However, it manages this without weakening what is the best melee combat system in any RPG. You will still be using combos, feints, parries and more, targeting specific areas of an enemy to catch them off guard.</p>
<p>Ten hours of recorded music with a full choir support all of this. I heard a few of the coming tracks, which will further enhance the immersion of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and add to the improvements mentioned above. It all comes down to what feels like it will be a much-improved game and precisely what a sequel should be: a natural expansion on the first.</p>

But I’m surprised by just how “immersive sim” it is, even if I get the sense Warhorse might shudder at that characterization.

It’s refreshingly medieval and whimsical and avoids the more generic tone of heroism that can sometimes accompany the genre’s music. At camp, I play a few rounds of the dice-based minigame Tankard, find a way to feed my dog (which you can pet, of course), and practice swordplay with Hans.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-recommend-id="image://7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1300" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-recommend-id="image://7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1300" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dueling against Hans feels weighty and deliberate as I select a direction for my attack with the right stick before swinging with the right trigger.

The game does a great job diegetically signaling what’s next, but it’s still a lot to account for. I initially suck at it. But after a few more fights, I start to feel the appeal of this combat system. Warhorse says it focused on making the combat more engaging and easier to understand for the sequel, tackling one of the most common criticisms of the first game.<br></p><p>Warhorse PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, who spoke on behalf of the studio during the event, says <em>KCD2 </em>is an “authentically medieval game but not a medieval simulation.” The combat speaks to that most. It feels like what I imagine medieval combat was like—deliberate, weighty, and a touch unwieldy—but still manages to be fun.<br></p><p>“Authentically medieval” also allows the team to get away with things like “Remedium Savegamium,” a potion that must be drunk to save the game. From the groans and laughter I hear during the preview when Warhorse mentions this, it’s clear fans of the series find this potion both a frustrating element of the first game and an endearing aspect of the difficulty and challenge it’s known for.<br></p><p>After some time in the camp, Hans beckons Henry to join him on a little adventure, following the voices of women he hears nearby. This moment serves as the game’s introduction to stealth, which seems simple but serviceable, but more importantly, it kicks off an event that sends Hans and Henry running for their lives. Bandits attack the crew back at camp and then the women, and Hans and Henry are forced to flee, but not before Henry takes an arrow to the back.<br></p><p>As the two attempt to escape across a nearby pond, Henry is forced to relive tragic (and trippy) moments of his history through flashbacks likely caused by extreme blood loss. I like these moments, as they inject a bit of fantasy and surrealism that <em>KCD2</em>’s devotion to “authentically medieval” might otherwise prevent, and the flashbacks help me, a newcomer to the series, catch up on how Henry went from a nobody to somebody. </p><figure id="" data-id="a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-recommend-id="image://a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2284" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Doing some alchemy in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-recommend-id="image://a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2284" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I eventually make it to a rickety backwood cabin and meet Pavlena and Hezbonah, who rehabilitate Henry and teach me alchemy (a fun multi-step minigame to craft potions) and the effects of my dialogue choices. Henry gains reputation with different people, like Pavlena and Hezbonah, as well as factions based on selections I make, even with dialogue that doesn’t rely on skill checks, which provides the type of introspection I feel in good <em>D&amp;D</em> roleplay. As I chose the Advisor playstyle in the game’s intro, my Henry leads with knowledge in conversation, but a Soldier playstyle might come off more brutish or a Thief more conniving.<br></p><p>Choosing Advisor, Soldier, or Thief allocates your starting ability points, but Warhorse says you aren’t locked into one direction and are free to class out your Henry however you like. Something I enjoy during my brief time with the game is the way it rewards your direct actions. Warhorse calls it “true roleplaying,” but it reminds me most of classic <em>Runescape</em> in the sense that if I want my combative actions to improve, I need to actually do things like swing a sword or shoot a bow. It’s nice interacting with the world to improve Henry’s abilities, as opposed to arbitrarily receiving points I can allocate to any skill after completing quests, and adds a satisfying level of action-and-immediate-consequence to the world.<br></p><p>I eventually reach the <em>KCD2</em> title card and just before I can finally interact with the open world of Bohemian Paradise, I’m booted out. Though it’s clear the sequel’s introductory hours are meant to catch new players up on this series and how it works, even I, a newcomer, found it slow when all was said and done. It’s a ton of dialogue, admittedly well-written, but enough to make one’s eyes glaze over in between the sparse gameplay sequences.<br></p><h2 id="h86380"><a id=""></a>A dash of <em>Thief </em>in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></h2><p>Thankfully, though, there’s more to come. The second half of my play session takes place 60 to 70 hours into the game, I’m told, in <em>KCD2</em>’s other major region, Kuttenberg, a place not seen in the first game but teased throughout. It’s a massive and sprawling medieval city inhabited by hundreds of NPCs and surrounded by villages and wilderness that invite exploration. According to Warhorse, Kuttenberg and Bohemian Paradise make up 25 square kilometers of <em>KCD2</em> to explore, double the size of its predecessor.<br></p><p>Here, I encounter the Meister of Frankfurt, Menhard, a loud but charming character attempting to become a local guild leader by challenging others who hold the title. Henry, who stumbles upon this conversation, is free to ignore it or at least stay quiet. But you can also side with Menhard or the opposing group of people. I side with Menhard and, after a dodgy conversation over a mug of beer, find myself in charge of stealing a special guild sword and hanging it at Town Hall.<br></p><p>It’s midday and, curious about this request, I immediately head toward the waypoint. This brings me to a locked door that I attempt to lockpick, clearly forgetting myself because the guards nearby immediately arrest me. Henry must first endure humiliation and embarrassment in a pillory before he’s freed and, because of his arrest, must now sleep to rid himself of a debuff that makes him easier to spot. I sleep long enough to get rid of it and awake at 1 a.m., the perfect time for some daring thievery. It’s here I learn that if you’re out at night, you have to carry a torch, lest you face questioning and scrutiny (that I fail) from guards patrolling the city…and it’s jail again. Soon, this time with a torch in hand, I attempt this guild sword heist at night again and eventually reach the correct location.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-recommend-id="image://d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2294" data-height="1292" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-recommend-id="image://d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2294" data-height="1292" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After successfully picking some locked doors, I enter. I see a guard at a table and sneak in close to knock him out. It’s here I learn that baths are important. Throughout my time in Kuttenberg, almost every NPC I walk by remarks on my smell, but I ignore it. I wish I hadn’t because as I sit behind the aforementioned guard preparing to knock him out, he smells something awful, turns around, and spots me…jail again. After a third attempt, I finally retrieve the sword and hang it at Town Hall as Menhard instructed. Acting as a guild challenge of sorts, Menhard, Henry, and a third NPC must now face off against the other guild would-bes in a tournament. I love that when Henry isn’t dueling, he must stand on the sidelines and watch the other NPCs duel. It’s a small touch of authenticity that I welcome after expecting the game to either fast-forward or let Henry join in on the other fights.<br></p><p>It’s here in this Kuttenberg section of the preview that I find the freedom, diversity, and variation the game’s opening lacks. Though the first two hours of the game feel paint-by-numbers, what I see in Kuttenberg, more than halfway through the game’s story, hints at a sprawling medieval RPG that borders immersive sim—I wish I’d gotten to experience more than just 60 minutes of it.<br></p><p>Warhorse stresses there is a linear story here—Henry is still on a quest to avenge his parents, who were murdered in the first game, all while fighting back against the invading Hungarian army—and I’m looking forward to seeing how it plays out. I especially enjoy the comedic buddy-duo dynamic between Henry and Hans and how their relationship informs the wider narrative moments happening around them (and sometimes because of them). However, it’s the steps I’ll take to reach those moments, the choices I’ll make mechanically informed by the real history of this medieval landscape, that excite me most as <em>KCD2</em> approaches launch early next year.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong>: <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D2FGZ3HF/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-medieval-rpg-1851626849&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D2FGZ3HF" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>.&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">&nbsp;</a></span><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-update-11361-full-patch-notes-details-new-settings-and-other-additions-as-starfield-becomes-carfield<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Earlier today, Bethesda announced that in the lead-up to Starfield's upcoming Shattered Space DLC, players would be treated to the game's first land vehicle, the Rev-8, in an update coming later tonight. Well, it's now later tonight, and Starfield's 1.13.61 update is now live.</p><p>The big centerpiece of this patch is, of course, the Rev-8. It's the game's first land vehicle, and we got our first look at it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA1z1DbA_Io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier today in a trailer</a>. It's kinda cute, bouncing around craters and things with its little hover jets and turret. Take a look:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The update isn't just car-centric, though the Rev-8 is a pretty big deal. There are a number of new settings being added such as a frame rate target setting allowing players to pick between 30, 40, 60, or uncapped on VRR displays. Non-VRR displays will still be able to select between 30 and 60, though players are warned screen tearing may occur on non-VRR displays if 60 is selected. There's also a new setting allowing you to prioritize between visuals and performance, and toggling Vsync on and off. And there are new Xbox Series S performance options added as well.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, the majority of the changes appear to be fixing various bugs or minor other adjustments to make gameplay a bit smoother.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Starfield Update Screenshots - gamescom ONL 2024</h3></div></output><p>Today's update comes ahead of a much larger DLC expansion entitled Shattered Space, which we learned today would be releasing on September 30. Shattered Space was<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-shattered-space-dlc-first-official-trailer-gives-players-a-first-look-at-house-varuuns-homeworld-xbox-games-showcase-2024"> first revealed back in June at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> and is the game's first story expansion. It takes place on the homeworld of House Va'Ruun and includes a new planet, weapons, spacesuits, gear, and more.</p><p>We gave Starfield a 7/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">our launch review</a>, saying that it "has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist."</p><p>The full patch notes are below.</p><h2>New settings:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Frame Rate Target:</strong> You can now choose between <strong>30, 40, 60 or an Uncapped</strong> frame rate on VRR displays. If you do not have a VRR display running 120hz, you will still be able to select from 30 or 60. Screen tearing may occur at times when selecting 60 on a non-VRR display.</li><li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> You can now prioritize between </li><li><strong>Visuals and Performance</strong> while trying to maintain the frame rate target. If you’re choosing a frame rate target of 60 or above, we recommend changing this to Performance. Prioritizing Visuals keeps the highest resolution while maintaining full detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Prioritizing Performance lowers internal resolution and detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier as well. When switching between modes, you will see the lighting change briefly as the system catches up to the new mode.</li><li><strong>VSync:</strong> You can now toggle between VSync off or on. Choosing off will separate the game frames from the monitor's refresh rate and may result in screen tearing. Toggling On will synchronize the frame rate to the monitor's refresh rate avoiding screen tearing but limiting number of frames.</li></ul><h2>Features</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added the new Rev-8 Vehicle which can be purchased from the ship technician</li><li>Added Xbox Series S performance options</li></ul><h2>General</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>General performance and stability improvements</li><li>Creations UI fixes and improvements</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue that could prevent fully scanning the planet Beta Marae I</li><li>Gameplay Options: Addressed an issue with Legendary weapons that could cause the Well Fed and Hydrated effects to refresh</li><li>Gameplay Options: Addressed an issue with switching weapons that could cause the "You are now Hydrated" notification to appear frequently</li><li>Gameplay Options: Addressed an issue that could cause Sustenance effects to stop working in NG+ variants</li><li>Fixed an issue with reloading the Novastrike sniper rifle</li><li>Resolved an issue that caused other characters to hold the Novastrike rifle incorrectly</li><li>Fixed a visual issue with the Magshot reload animation in zero-g</li><li>Extreme Temperature Entry Spacesuit can now be put on displays</li><li>Addressed an issue that could cause multiple items to spawn on display stands</li><li>The Rattler displayed on the Trackers Alliance headquarters wall can now be interacted with</li><li>Gravity Well no longer pulls NPCs into the ships in the Chop Shop</li><li>Adjusted map location markers in cities to improve fast travelling</li><li>The apartment in The Well in New Atlantis now has a map marker</li><li>The marker for Shepherd's General Store in Akila should display properly</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Rapid Legendary effect to not properly apply to melee weapons</li><li>Addressed an issue that could cause Lyle Brewer to become hostile to the player as a follower</li><li>Updated the status text for the Shielded Grip and Large Shielded Grip mods for the Plasma Cutter</li><li>Adjusted the balance on Mysterious Tracker’s Voice audio</li><li>Resolved an issue that could cause unexpected noises upon entering the Lodge for NG+ variants</li></ul><h2>Ships</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that could cause Ship docking bridges to remain extended</li><li>Addressed an issue with modifying a landed non-home ship that could cause a duplicate ship model to appear on the landing pad</li><li>Shipbuilder: Ship module variants and flip versions will now correctly revert to the original when pressing the Cancel button</li><li>Ship Decoration: Addressed an issue with the Ecliptic Claymore that could allow objects to be placed outside of the ship</li></ul><h2>Graphics</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that would cause the Frame generation setting to be turned off when DLSS was selected for Upscaling (PC)</li><li>Fixed lighting for ship and station interiors in photo mode</li><li>Improved quality of reflections in shallow puddles</li><li>Addressed an issue with upscaling that could cause visual artifacts on planets when viewed from space</li><li>Helmets will now toggle correctly for companions who are downed in photo mode</li></ul><h2>UI</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue with the Ship and Inventory menus on 21:9 resolutions</li><li>Fixed an issue with how large Carry Capacity is displayed in the inventory with large font enabled</li><li>Addressed an issue with how The Cue Ball and Ping Pong Ball display in the inventory menu</li></ul><h2>Outposts</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Flood lamps decoration items will now correctly toggle off and on at outposts featuring a power source</li></ul><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

			<p>One of the most surprising announcements of Gamescom 2024's Opening Night Live is the announcement of Mafia: The Old Country. While a new Mafia game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/">been rumored</a> for quite a while, it wasn't officially announced what it could be. Today, 2K and Hanger 13 officially revealed the new title that will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crDUx5suLm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additional details about this upcoming game will be unveiled in December 2024, potentially when they release news on the official release date in 2025 or show off the game play.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was announced with the game set in a stunning vista of 1900s Sicily. In this game, you will uncover the origins of organized crime as you uncover a gritty mob story about the brutal underworld in Sicily. You have to fight for survival in a perilous and punishing era, with action brought to life with authentic realism and detailed storytelling.</p>
<p>This takes the Mafia franchise to a completely different part of the world, with the previous Mafia games being set in various periods throughout America.</p>
<p>"Across the first three entries in the Mafia franchise, we introduced players to the world of the Mafia through brutal stories set in different eras. In Mafia: The Old Country, we're going back to the roots of what fans love about the franchise, crafting a deep, linear narrative with that classic mob movie feeling, visiting a stunning new setting, and delivering it all in a tight, focused package perfect for fans of immersive experiences," says Nick Baynes, President of Hangar 13.</p>
<p>Mafia was first initialized as a franchise, with the landmark game released in 2002. Since then, the Mafia franchise has taken off, selling more than 34 million copies across console and PC. The games are highly rated by both critics and fans, with specific praise for the rich narrative development, performances from the actors, and great attention to detail to ensure the game is period-appropriate.</p>
<p>If this game has sparked your interest and you want to explore the Mafia franchise, now is the perfect time. All released games in the Mafia franchise are on Steam until September 2.</p>
<p>So far, Gamescom 2024 has shaped up to be a big event for 2K. Tonight, on the first big day at the Gamescom convention in Germany, they announced Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 and gave fans a release date for Civilization 7.</p>

Publishers Paradox Interactive and developers The Chinese Room say the delay will allow them to continue to polish the game, respond to feedback, and expand on its story.

<p>Paradox announced the news with a video featuring Alex Skidmore, creative director at The Chinese Room, and Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO at Paradox.

<p>"Earlier this year, Paradox reaffirmed our commitment to delivering high-quality games to our players, and the launch update is a proactive decision derived from this commitment," said <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/whats-next-for-bloodlines-2">a statement accompanying the delay</a>. "Though the game is in a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window, Paradox and The Chinese Room collaboratively decided to prioritize polish."
</p>
<p>The announcement seems designed to reassure the waiting public that the game is on the home stretch, with only "polish" to be done, but in this case polish isn't limited to bug fixes but also seems to include additional content, more story, more endings, diversified clan combat, and more. 
</p>
<p>Paradox have had a rough year, stretching from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$22 million flop of Lamplighters League</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">buggy launch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">rushed DLC</a> of Cities Skylines 2, the last-minute <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">cancellation of Life By You</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">indefinite delay of Prison Architect 2</a>.
</p>
<p>Those stumbles led to Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester to admit the company had made the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">"wrong calls" in several major projects</a>, while reporting falling profits.
</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2's history isn't any happier. Originally aiming for release in 2020, its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">creative lead was fired</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">was taken off its developers</a>, and it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">resurfaced only last year at The Chinese Room</a> after a supposed period of secret development. It continues to look barebones in every trailer in such a way that any delay seems inevitable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I, like many of you, grew up watching anime. I'm old enough that we didn't even call it “anime” at the time--the term didn't really start to take hold until the late 80's--but my childhood was defined by <em>Macross</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, my teens by <em>Akira</em> and <em>Patlabor</em>, <em>Neon Genesis</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, <em>Royal Space Force</em> and OK you get the idea.</p><p>From my earliest TV-watching memories through my teens, I could not get enough of that shit. I once dragged my parents around Melbourne's Chinatown on a holiday just to get a <em>Neon Genesis</em> poster. I paid an <em>embarrassing </em>amount of money to import a <em>Macross Plus </em>soundtrack from Japan on CD. I wore home-made t-shirts with iron-on anime transfers and had an extensive collection of bootleg tapes (and later DVDs). I was in deep, but like I said, I was far from alone: many of you reading will probably have similar origin stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Memories (1995) || Cannon Fodder - Blasting The Cannon Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-OQFslDKiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Where my story might differ from some of yours, though, is that once I hit my 20s my love for anime fell off a cliff. Not because I'd got older or somehow outgrown it; I still wanted to love anime, but as the 90's rolled into the 2000's I started finding less and less of it that really got its hooks into me. The stuff I'd been into when I was younger just didn't seem to be getting made anymore.</p><p>Which is fine– that's culture, baby. Nothing stands still, everything is always in motion. Generations ebb and flow like the tides and, like movies and music, anime was no different. I knew this, and I accepted it, but also...a part of me wishes it wasn't the case. Not for nostalgia's sake, I am not a classical statue profile pic fascist who wants to <em>go back</em>, I just think a lot of the stuff I watched as a kid was excellent in ways that a lot of modern anime could be, but simply doesn’t want to be, for whatever reason.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RoyalSpaceForce - Invasion Scene HD (Spoiler)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3l3yEGblTj8?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I could have simply left this blog here: An old man yelling at the clouds, pining for the Good Old Days. But that would be boring. Also, as you can probably tell by now, while I was an anime enthusiast, I am not an anime <em>expert</em>, so what the fuck do I even know about what trends are, what shapes them and what everyone is watching today as a result. So instead of settling into middle age and saying goodbye to anime forever, I decided to speak with a bunch of people who <em>are</em> experts, first to try to find out why they don't make the stuff I like anymore (or if that's even true), and then while I was at it, see if there is anything around today that I <em>would </em>like, and which I might have missed given my relative distance from the medium.</p><p>(I should say here that in more recent years I've watched and loved <em>Cyberpunk</em>, <em>Yakitori</em>, <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Blame</em>, <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> and most of <em>Attack on Titan</em>, so it's not like I've simply gone cold turkey).</p><p>First up is<strong> Austin Walker</strong>, formerly of Waypoint and Giant Bomb and a ton of other stuff, who I basically asked: why don't we get anime with cool machines and sinister Cold War politics anymore?</p><p>"You've already ID'd half of why they don't make things like this anymore", Walker says. "We aren't in the late Cold War/early neoliberal malaise anymore, we're in something else, with its own aesthetic register. That register is (in part) less mechanical and more digital, less clicky buttons and switches, more touchscreens and voice-commands.</p><p>"And, wouldn't you know it, that shift happens right around when cel animation is replaced by 'digipaint' style anime in the 2000s. It took artists a lot of time to adjust to this new technique, and I think the mood and aesthetic you're talking about here were <em>harder </em>to achieve early on in this shift (though there are definitely examples of it now). You can literally see it happen in, for instance, the shift from <em>Big O</em> season 1 to season 2. Both happen to be late instances of the aesthetic you're talking about, but so much of what makes the show visually spectacular is lost in the transition to digital. <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em>, similarly, is an early digipaint show and despite it being excellent (especially in the first season), it leans into a brighter, 'post-cyberpunk' aesthetic space that fits the strengths of that technology and what artists in that era were able to do with it."</p><p>Basically, Walker says, the world went from one using hardware to one using software, and anime's aesthetic inspiration followed. "And then, as CG has filtered in to supplement and then replace that tech, it's happened again."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Macross Plus Anime Aesthetic //  Vestron Vulture - Hair on Fire" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkUVkuRFGPQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I asked a similar question of <strong>Toussaint Egan</strong>, curation editor at Polygon. Just what was going on in Japanese politics and society in the 80's and 90's that influenced anime so much, and did that play a part in my favourite examples of the medium--most of which he sums up as part of a genre called "Real Robot"--drying up as times and politics changed?</p><p>"You mentioned a prevalent tone in anime productions during the late 70s-mid 90s", Egan says. "I personally believe this is attributable to a combination of factors, among them the rise of the Real Robot aesthetic, and with it an emphasis on more 'gritty,' grounded human stories during the late 70's, the uncertainty in the wake of the bursting of the bubble economy in the late 80's, and a general sense of existential apprehension regarding the impending end of the 20th century."</p><p>Take <em>Patlabor </em>(1989), for example, one of my favourites. Egan says the film's underlying inspiration was anxiety about land developers and corporations "mowing down old neighborhoods in a race to create new commercial spaces and housing for wealthy clientele", while <em>Patlabor 2</em> (1993) was influenced instead by global politics, in particular "existential questions concerning Japan’s sovereignty, especially regarding Article 9 of Japan's post-WWII constitution, the nature of the JSDF, and its then-recent deployment in international UN operations in Cambodia."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【机动警察PATLABOR 2】自卫队政变（JSDF Coup d'état）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_Bg4SQvhXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Those were poignant issues for the time, but times change. "A lot of folks point to 1995’s <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> as the inflection point at which Real Robot aesthetics peaked, and I happen to agree", Egan says. "Regardless of whether or not someone wants to argue if <em>Evangelion </em>was necessarily a 'deconstruction' of mecha anime tropes, it is a series that took the Real Robot concept to its ultimate conclusion: by taking the concept of mecha as non-biological apparatuses that augment and extend biological human capabilities and went so far as to depict the mecha themselves as living, bio-mechanical hybrid entities. <em>Evangelion </em>took the aesthetic touchpoints and philosophical foundations of Real Robot mecha and pushed them until they broke."</p><p>Which more than answers my questions about the underlying politics of that time period, but as Austin mentioned, that big cultural shift in anime coincided with a technological revolution as well. The anime from my childhood had a feel, but it also had a <em>look</em>, so what effect did the advent of digipaint have on anime from the 2000's onwards?</p><p>"The majority of anime doesn’t look the same way that it did before the turn of the century because of the industry-wide transition from traditional cel animation to digital paint and ink, or digipaint", Egan explains. "The amount of anime produced yearly now eclipses what was produced in previous decades before the turn of the century, and that’s attributable in no small part to the transition to digipaint.</p><p>"However, that efficiency comes at the cost of what many anime viewers would describe as the 'vibe' of pre-2000s anime; the particular color palette and hues, background art designs, and subtle character acting details that were attributable to the physical hand drawn and painted process behind cel animation."</p><figure></figure><p>To help explain how these seismic shifts took place on a <em>personal</em> level, how there were changes in the people making popular anime and their own experiences, I turned to <strong>Isaiah Colbert</strong>, my former colleague at Kotaku who is now an anime freelancer for places like IGN.</p><p>"Ultimately, it boils down to a sign of the times", Colbert says. "Modern-day animators are not wholly concerned with the existential in terms of tech and war. They are more concerned with the personal, i.e., mental health and interpersonal relationships with anime like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, <em>Your Name</em>, and <em>Belle</em>. Creators and anime creators are kind of in a period where flashy animation and compositing in shows like <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> and <em>Demon Slayer</em> are the de jour."</p><p>Those are prominent examples, but they're not the rule. There have and always will be weightier anime, with <em>Pluto</em> being a recent example, though even that has caveats. Colbert says, "<em>Pluto</em>, like works from auteurs like Hayao Miyazaki, has the distinction of being helmed by an animation veteran like producer Masao Maruyama. Having a stalwart vet like Mappa, Studio M2, and Madhouse founder Maruyama---who has been in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pluto-netflx-anime-astro-boy-anime-expo-2023-interview-1850600279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business for 60+ years</a>---gives shows like <em>Pluto </em>the sensibilities to create a show that wrestles with politics, war, machines, and apocalyptic affairs from his lived experience."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PLUTO | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ez8lm9I26Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Colbert points out that Tatsuki Fujimoto, creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has recently lamented figures like Hayao Miyazaki becoming a dying breed in Japanese animation.<a href="https://shueisha.online/articles/-/146972?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> In a 2023 interview</a>, Fujimoto said many modern creators, brought up as "otaku", are only interested in making derivative works of Japanese media that already exists, while veterans like Miyazaki were able to draw on a more varied, lived experience.</p><p>"This isn't to say that detailed and atmospheric art is hard to come by in anime", Colbert adds. "But anime probably won't ever have that same kind of panache as a <em>Patlabor </em>or OG <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, unless it has someone from that era on its production committee to have enough sway to let those projects harken back to that era. Otherwise, those visual motifs and ideals will probably be dictated as an homage or reference in a more future-focused project more concerned with digital futurism than analog artifacts. This is a nicer way of saying an iPad baby can't be expected to see a world bigger than what's in their immediate surroundings."</p><p>Egan believes this generational shift isn't just a result of what's happened with creators and studios from inside Japan, but has been impacted by an increasing foreign influence on the medium as well.</p><p>"American-Japanese co-productions of anime are becoming more prevalent, and this is having a marked effect on what kinds of anime are greenlit", Egan says. "Anime creators aren’t just creating anime for domestic audiences anymore, but international audiences. That’s not to say that they didn’t consider them before — but now, it’s not just a matter of guesswork. They’re getting clear feedback and direct responses from broadcasters and streaming services who aren’t just competing for broadcasting rights from pre-existing projects, but actively commissioning projects themselves. They’re following international trends, which currently favor adaptations of serialized manga that have already proven to have an established readership and pre-existing fanbase. Those manga happen to skew within genres like supernatural shonen, isekai, romance, or sci-fi action. Mecha just isn’t one of those genres right now."</p><p>OK, so that mostly answers my query as to why I have trouble finding anime that I like in 2024. But like I've said, I'm no expert, and as I've drifted away from the medium there's a very good chance I've missed out on stuff I might otherwise have been into. Series like <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>Yakitori</em>, for example, might not be <em>exactly </em>my thing, but there's enough overlap on their venn diagram for me to enjoy them.</p><p>For help here I asked <strong>Kate Sanchez</strong>, EiC of But Why Tho?, anime writer for places like Paste<em> </em>and Polygon<em> </em>and a Crunchyroll anime awards judge, for some recommendations based on the stuff I used to be into.</p><p>"I think when it comes to finding new anime, there are so many new ones that it makes it hard to find the genre or type that you're looking for", she says. "Additionally, robotics, cyberpunk, and mechanical anime have become less of the focus unless it's mecha. Oftentimes, it's all held in a general sci-fi category, which sometimes makes it hard to figure out if it has what you're looking for.</p><p>"We're in a resurgence of original mech anime right now, but I would say the 90's and 2000's were probably when it was at a peak moment. But it is still here, the love of machinery isn't gone yet. I think science-heavy and technical anime is an important element that you could explore when looking at all of the intersections. I think the realm of cyberpunk anime may have more detailed machinery that you're looking for. Not to plug my own site, but we did a <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2020/10/looking-for-more-cyberpunk-check-out-these-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cyberpunk manga list</a> a while ago, and that was actually the first time looking at the art that I thought about the high focus on mechanical details."</p><p>Kate's recommendations included:</p><p>Ergo Proxy:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ergo Proxy Trailer HD &quot;Pulse of the awakening&quot;" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWI97Kg8ur8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>No Guns Life:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="No Guns Life | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQyWoG43kRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Kuromukuro:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【KUROMUKURO】Promotion Video [Official English Sub.]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIOgBRsCsUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Fafner:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fafner - The Complete Series - Available on BD/DVD Combo 9.18.12 - Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yqsbemrzlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And, for a steampunk twist, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQ9VjFBqfH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>OK, so that's a lot to get through! I'm going to be spending months doing so, and all the while I'll probably be kicking myself for limiting my scope so narrowly all this time, clinging so tightly to one era's anime while largely ignoring what came after. But I'm also extremely grateful for the advice and assistance given by all these experts, down to some parting perspective on the whole thing from Austin.</p><p>"We're older, and we've already experienced decades of first time exposure to these things", Walker says. "When we saw all those things--the androids' hands opening up to speedtype in the first <em>GitS</em>; the truth of what was hidden below Nerv HQ; Tetsuo giving way to a bulging mass of flesh and rage--they were groundbreaking, fresh ideas. Today we live in a world made by those images. And I have to imagine that younger viewers are having similar experiences with things that land flatter for us. In fact, I know they are, because I see them posting about it.</p><p>"I don't know that these two big ideas are in direct conflict. I think being a media consumer in 2024 is exactly about being stuck between these two pressures: Overwhelmed and disoriented by what's on offer. Sure that something has changed, though unclear on what specifically did. But able to, if we're lucky and persistent, dig through the chaff to find exactly the thing we're looking for."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new co-op combat spectacle-style game has been revealed at Gamescom 2024. This game is being developed by Glowmade and published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/">Amazon Games</a>, titled King of Meat. It's a chaotic, hack-and-slash online co-op for up to four players, where you must become a fearless contender as you battle through high-intensity dungeons with ridiculous traps.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CICrUbma4o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game takes place in Loregok, where players are taken to a place where they will encounter dragons, trolls, skeletons, and corporate commercialism. High fantasy meets glitz, glamor, and media infatuation with modern-day celebrity in this wacky game. If it isn't apparent by now, the obsession is the survival game show that you participate in, named King of Meat.</p>
<p>All of the dungeons you run through take place in the Komstruct Koliseum, where you entertain the local people. You play a character desperate to seek glory, gold, and fame. Not only do you have to fight for your life against the traps and obstacles that block your path, but there is also every kind of monster imaginable to try and stop you in your tracks.</p>
<p>While you're fighting for your life, you must try and impress the obsessive crowd by using flourish in your combat skills and showmanship as you traverse tricky dungeons filled with lava, spinning blades, rotating spikes, and much more. While that may sound over the top already, there are also inter-dimensional black holes, exploding ducks, and giant horse hooves designed to stop you in your tracks.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you want to get stuck into, you can check out the new trailer for King of Meat that premiered during Gamescom Opening Night Live below. King of Meat will feature a UGC dungeon building and will be available for digital purchase, with the game launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1926980/King_of_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>At the moment, King of Meat has no planned release date, with the Steam page saying "coming soon." However, we will surely hear more about this wacky party game in the future. If you don't like being the contender yourself, you also have the option to torture other people by creating your Dungeons for people to play through and try to survive against the vicious traps and intuitive tools you have utilized.</p>
<p>In addition, you can customize your character however you like and choose your outfits, accessories, and emotes to show off your confidence as a contender in King of Meat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘The Beast’ Replaces Dying Light 2’s Second DLC]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-beast-dying-light-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-beast%E2%80%99-replaces-dying-light-2%E2%80%99s-second-dlc.959070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-beast-dying-light-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Techland revealed a new instalment of the Dying Light series at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase. It’s called ‘Dying Light: The Beast, and it’ll see the first game’s protagonist, Kyle Crane, make a return to the franchise. It’s a standalone title with around 20 hours of gameplay in an all-new setting, and it’ll feature cooperative gameplay and vehicular elements, much like the first game’s ‘The Following’ expansion.</p>



<p>However, it was subsequently revealed in a press release that The Beast will replace the long-awaited second DLC for Dying Light 2, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-and-better">Bigger and Better</h2>



<p>Per the press release issued by Techland:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human. But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that in mind, Techland will make The Beast available to owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 free of charge. It’ll be a standalone purchase for anyone else, though.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Dying Light: The Beast will be released, but Techland’s brief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer released earlier</a> today revealed something worth waiting for. It’s not a <strong>full game</strong> in the series, but it’s a handsome expansion that’ll bring back a fan-favourite character.</p>



<p>In Dying Light: The Beast, players can lean on Kyle Crane’s previous infection, using the ‘powers of the undead’ to their advantage. It takes place in a more rural region than players are used to, but in the tight-knit map, there are still some urban patches to explore, and once again, parkour mechanics are front and centre. </p>



<p>Are you excited to see Kyle Crane again? Let us know in the comments.</p>
