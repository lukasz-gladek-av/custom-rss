In a handy bit of advice, the company has urged buyers to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-remove-switch-2s-protective-film-nintendo-says/1100-6531977/">not peel off the protective film on the screen</a> and it has revealed more details on how games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-switch-2-footage-shows-the-game-looking-much-smoother-in-action/1100-6531995/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will run more smoothly on the Switch 2</a>.</p>

The idea, many thought, was that Activision was intrusively trying to push microtransactions on players in a new way.</p><p>Now, Activision has disabled this and claimed it was only a "test" that was added to the game by accident. Fans aren't buying that explanation, however.</p><p>"A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game," <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision said.</a></p><p>The replies to Activision's post are full of people claiming Activision is gaslighting fans and offering a poor excuse for what happened. Some people replied to say the new UI feature was helpful to them, as it surfaced a specific weapon or bundle that they might have otherwise never seen.</p><p>In any event, the feature is now gone, but its removal isn't likely to do much to quell the concerns of some that Call of Duty is pushing microtransactions on players. The game regularly highlights paid DLC bundles that players can spend money on to acquire new operators, guns, and other items.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the performance update coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2 will see the game running at what appears to be a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>As documented by the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-footage-shows-60fps-gameplay-for-switch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Life</a>, the news was posted on the Nintendo Today news app, and while several people have posted footage of the game running at 60fps on social media platforms, it's probably best to watch the footage on the original app if you can thanks to the "wonders" of compression.</p>

<p>In essence, the update shows&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>running as they arguably always should have done, and hopefully, this will convince more folks to love the games like I do. That story really shouldn't be missed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=c3MI7LaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=aRApZD4J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>(pictured here on the original Switch) will look much nicer on the Switch 2, and they'll run better too.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>run smoother on the Switch 2, but they'll also look much sharper, if the Nintendo Today footage is anything to go by. If you haven't already checked the games out, it looks like Switch 2 will be the place to do it.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are just two of the games getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free Switch 2 performance patches</a> on the console's launch day (that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">this Thursday</a>). Others include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Arms</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em>.</p>

<p>These updates are distinct from Nintendo's Switch 2 Edition initiative, which will charge you a fee to upgrade your game to a Switch 2-native version with more substantial visual and performance improvements.</p>

<p>Games getting Switch 2 Edition versions include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">Level-5's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>.</p>

                <p>Roblox game Grow A Garden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">continuing to see massive numbers</a> of players, reaching a new high that's more than triple the Steam concurrent players record set by PUBG back in its heyday. The Roblox game is a farming-sim-meets-idle-game, but there's something about Grow A Garden that's seen it smashing records both on Roblox and off.</p><p>After a new update was released for the game--which are officially referred to as "experiences" on Roblox--the concurrent-player number shot to a new high of 11,694,315, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-game-grow-a-garden-suddenly-shatters-several-all-time-player-count-records-3196238/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reports</a>. The <a href="https://guinness-world-records.fandom.com/wiki/Roblox_records" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records Fandom wiki</a> has Grow A Garden breaking multiple Roblox platform records, including most visits in 10 minutes, most visits in 1 hour, most visits gained in a day, most visits gained in a week, and overall most concurrent players.</p><p>To put that in context, the record for most concurrent players on Steam belongs to PUBG, which saw an all-time high of 3,257,248 back when it started the trend for battle royale games. That's less than a third of what Grow A Garden is seeing on Roblox. To compare to another evergreen battle royale title, Fortnite's all-time concurrent record is over 14 million--a record Grow A Garden hasn't beaten yet, but it is surprisingly close to it.</p><p>Grow A Garden released in late March, and since then its popularity has eclipsed other popular Roblox games like Dress to Impress, Blox Fruits, and Adopt Me. The game was developed by an unknown teenage developer, but a studio called Splitting Point has now stepped in to manage it.</p><p>The farming genre has produced a number of surprise hits before--Farmville enjoyed similar viral success on Facebook over 15 years ago, while Stardew Valley remains popular almost 10 years after it was first released. Grow A Garden's idle gameplay likely adds to its popularity--players can plant seeds and let them grow while they're offline, making it an easy game to get into even with little time to play.</p>

            <p>Activision has claimed advertisements for microtransactions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> players were seeing on their loadouts were added by mistake, following intense community fallout.</p>
<p>This announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291">the official Call of Duty Twitter account</a>, which posted, "A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game."</p>
<p>Reactions to this post aren't exactly glowing in positivity. Twitter users expressed their disbelief in the statement, unconvinced that a feature like loadout ads were accidentally implemented, rather they were pulled down following negative feedback. <a href="https://x.com/ProRebornYT/status/1929756558348767663">One user wrote</a>, "this some soviet era level gaslighting".</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-shows-you-microtransaction-ads-when-you-swap-weapons">controversial addition at the weekend came alongside the game's fourth season</a>, and essentially meant that every time you swapped weapons you'd see a billboard-style poster shilling a premium skin. This, as you can imagine, went down like a lead balloon among the Call of Duty community, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/comment/muy8exa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with one player on Reddit writing</a>, "actively witnessing call of duty become the krusty krab".</p>
<p>The Season 4 update also brought with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">the returning Verdansk map to Warzone</a>, widely believed to be the best map the game has ever had, with a variety of new additions to mix things up for older players.</p>
<p>At the same time, Activision continues its years-long struggle against cheaters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">recently allowing players to turn off crossplay in order to help avoid cheaters</a>, a nasty group of ne'er-do-wells Activision admits are most prominently found on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most-requested features will be coming to the game at a later date, and that a new sales milestone has been reached as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780347576750367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, the two studios celebrate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>reaching 3.5 million sales across both its physical and digital versions, which means it's amassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">another 1.5m sales in the last few days</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, however, in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco confirm that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will be getting duo expeditions at some point in the future. At the moment, it's only possible to play as a solo adventurer or in a group of three, unless one of your squad leaves partway through a run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=vm578ufc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=VibhdlM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duos are finally on their way to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as duos, FromSoftware has also confirmed that future&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>updates will add "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month", although the studio doesn't explain exactly what that will entail.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be getting DLC "later this year", and although we're not sure what that will include either, I'd be surprised if it didn't add new minibosses, new map locations, and new Nightlords to take down at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">wildly successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The game takes the core combat of its bigger sibling and transposes it into a roguelike environment, where the goal is to gear up, level up, and fight bosses before taking down a bigger boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>Updates to improve&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay and infrastructure are already underway. Just yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival" rel="nofollow">released an update for the game</a> that included the ability to revive during solo play, among other improvements.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign-deluxe-edition/9NDVX8HSXGLR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-extend-day-2-almost-indefinitely-to-power-up-further-before-the-nightlord-boss-battle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> feels way more restrictive than your typical soulslike, and many of its central mechanics have been designed to urge Nightfarers to explore Limveld quickly to level up and obtain as many upgrades as possible to be able to stand a chance against the Nightlord waiting at the end of any Expedition. One of the most restrictive mechanics of the game is the Night Tide mechanics, which effectively impose a time limit during Day 1 and Day 2. Once the Night Tide starts moving, certain parts of the map will essentially become inaccessible, as staying outside the safe circle will deal constant damage to the Nightfarer.</p>
<p>The fact that the Night Nide constantly damages Nightfarers in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> also acts as a sort of secondary limitation for Day 2. After defeating the boss, the only thing you can do inside the safe circle is to head over to the Spirit Shelter to get ready to face the Nightlord, so most players do so to continue the Expedition. What many don't know, however, is that <strong>there's a way to extend Day 2 almost indefinitely to get more Runes and upgrades and get better chances to defeat the Nightlord in Day 3.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603131423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike Day 1, <strong>Day 2 doesn't end automatically shortly after defeating the boss, and only does so when players enter the Spirit Shelter</strong>. As such, with the exception of the bosses roaming the field outside of locations like Castles and Camps,<strong> the state of the map remains the same as before</strong>. Churches will still feature Flask upgrades if they haven't been picked, undefeated mobs will still be out in the field, and all location bosses will still be in their place, waiting for you. <strong>This means that you can still obtain Runes and every other type of upgrade as if you were playing the game normally during daytime</strong>, only that you will have to constantly heal with your Flask, and use Sites of Grace, which continue to function normally even when inside the Night Tide. <strong>If you plan your journey properly, have the maximum amount of Flask uses, and use the Sites of Grace to restore your healing charges, you can continue defeating bosses and improve your character until you can clear the entire map, </strong>if the situation allows. And even if, by chance, you are killed, you can try again as many times as you like, as the penalties for dying at the end of Day 2 will be the same as those when dying during daytime, so you will lose one level and all your runes.</p>
<p>Employing this strategy effectively at the end of Day 2 requires some planning, excellent knowledge of the Elden Ring Nightreign mechanics, and a bit of luck, but not only can it be a great help, it can also make the experience even more thrilling and fun. Give it a try while playing solo, and it won't take long for you to see how viable this actually is. Seeing as this is probably unintended, the ability to continue exploring without a time limit at the end of Day 2 may get patched out, so make sure to take advantage of it while you still can.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zynga-shuts-down-torchlight-3-developer-four-years-after-its-acquisition.1205313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/zynga-shuts-down-torchlight-3-echtra-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
        

        <p>The San Francisco studio and over 50 employees had been working on a new ARPG, still unannounced.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Echtra Games, the San Francisco-based studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/torchlight-iii">Torchlight 3</a>, will be shut down by its owner <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a> by the end of June.</p>
<p>The studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/torchlight-3-developer-bought-by-zynga">acquired by Zynga in 2021</a>, had been working alongside NaturalMotion on another RPG, one we'll never see. While no specific employee count is listed on the official website, the company's LinkedIn page lists it as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/echtra-inc.">having 61 employees as of writing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-publisher-shutters-studio-founded-by-torchlight-diablo-creator-before-it-could-announce-its-new-game">IGN received an official statement</a> confirming the news, which states, "Zynga has made the difficult decision to cease operations at its Echtra studio, ending development on future titles and reducing roles. This decision is part of a strategic realignment of the company's resources and priorities. We will work closely with impacted employees so they are treated with the utmost respect and consideration as we navigate this difficult process."</p>
<p>Echtra Games was founded in 2016 by Max Schaefer, but had a history that stretched long before that. While Echtra would make Torchlight 3 it was Runic Games, another studio founded in part by Max alongside his brother Erich, that created <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/torchlight-hands-on">Torchlight</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/torchlight-ii">Torchlight 2</a>.</p>
<p>Even earlier than that, both Schaefer brothers would team up with David Brevik to found Condor in 1993. Three years later, this team would become Blizzard North, and release the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo">Diablo</a> in 1997. The team would then go on to release the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> in 2000.</p>
<p>Many from this team, including both brothers and Brevik among others from Blizzard North, would then go on to found Flagship Studios, releasing the rad action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellgate-london">Hellgate London </a>in 2007. So there's a lot of history behind Echtra Games, a real legacy, tragically cut short today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/everything-we-learned-about-riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-at-pre-launch-summit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Week, Techraptor was among a group of Media, TCG Influencers, and Riot Games influencers that were lucky enough to be invited to LA to visit the Riot Games headquarters and not only play <em>Riftbound</em>, the <em>League of Legends TCG</em>, but also hear all about the game's roadmap. We got to hear about <em>Riftbound's </em>release plans, organized play strategy, and design principles as the "physical fandom expression of <em>League of Legends</em> for all fans out there."</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning what we thought about the game be sure to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a63f9b90-cea7-4679-9c53-8cdd7c0159bd" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow">check out our preview</a>, if you're interested in learning a bit more about Deckbuilding you can check out the rules and styles of decks that will be available as part of Set One, and if you're a collector wondering what cards you'll want to be looking for be sure to check out our guide on the rarity of cards and the incredibly exclusive Overnumbered cards.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning about the release of Set One, Origins, what it will take to make it to <em>Riftbound Worlds</em>, or what kinds of steps were taken during the development process then continue below.</p>

<p>Set one of <em>Riftbound </em>will be called <em>Origins</em>, this set is being designed as a warm welcome not only to fans of <em>League of Legends</em> and it's spin-off games and media, but also an introduction to TCG players, featuring Legends with a wide variety of mechanics.</p>

<p>Dave Guskin, Game Director for <em>Riftbound</em>, explained that while future Sets may have more theming that Origins is meant to be "good honest <em>Riftbound</em>… whatever that means."</p>

<p>While we at the event got our hands on the four Trial Decks there is a lot planned for the release including Booster Packs and Sets, a Proving Grounds 'board-game-like' experience for 2-4 players with everything you need to play, and three Champion Decks (<em>Riftbound's </em>version of a pre-con) featuring Jinx, Victor, and Lee Sin.</p>

<h2>The Road To Release</h2>

<p>Talking more about where <em>Riftbound </em>came from it was explained that while investigating ways to bring Legends of Runeterra to China they discovered that while bringing in a Video Game was difficult, that a physical TCG would be a completely different story.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-conference-room.jpg?itok=-lD1m7Ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-conference-room.jpg?itok=emEjnVTY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once the basics of the gameplay had been ironed out it became very apparent, internally and externally, that <em>Riftbound </em>was a fun game that there was a desire to bring to a global audience. From there Riot Games was able to continue to develop <em>Riftbound </em>at a rapid pace, what helped even further was that they were able to leverage all of the art from Legends of Runeterra to feature on cards, allowing them to find a release pace that would be impossible otherwise.</p>

<p>While the core mechanics had been nailed down through pre-release events the team at Riot had continued to hear feedback that the art wasn't looking enough like something that shows off the flair of <em>Riftbound</em>.</p>

<p>With this feedback changes were implemented including a new design to make all of the cards look more recognizable from a distance and also add things like a border filigree that represents the rarity of a card or have artwork that 'breaks' out of the frame as they get rarer.</p>

<p>There was also an aim to appease to both Western and Eastern players where by "for the west [Riot] wanted everything to be clear, for the East [Riot] wanted to have full art and the flash."</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">June 9th to July 18th - There will be a "spoiler season" where <em>Riftbound </em>cards will be getting slowly previewed</li>
	<li aria-level="1">June 27th to July 12th - <em>League of Legends Mid-Season Internationals</em>, taking place in Vancouver this year, will offer demos</li>
	<li aria-level="1">July 31st to August 3rd - GenGon</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Summer - China launch for <em>Riftbound</em></li>
	<li aria-level="1">October - English Release, including Organized Play</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><em>League of Legends World Championships</em> in China and the <em>TFT Paris Open</em> in France</li>
</ul><h2><em>Riftbound </em>Preview Season</h2>

<p>If you're wanting to learn more about the cards that will be accessible to you the Card Gallery will be getting updated with two to three cards every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday up until 2 weeks before the official Chinese launch of <em>Riftbound</em>. Once the card previews are over Riot Games will then start releasing Deckbuilding and Gameplay content to help you begin as a pro.</p>

<p>Each of these card groupings will have mechanics in common or be specifically shown off to get your TCG strategy brains working to try to come up with different strategies that you might want to implements in your own deck when <em>Riftbound </em>fully releases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-activating-a-card.jpg?itok=p_2nYSyZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-activating-a-card.jpg?itok=sZQApBq1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some cards won't just be released via the Card Gallery but will be revealed by Press, Influencers, and members of the community so be sure to also be following creators.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound: Origins</em> will release with an impressive 377 cards total.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound Set 2</em> and Beyond</h2>

<p><em>Riftbound </em>plans to support continued sets with plans for a total of four sets a year and localization into new languages being explored. That being said the team is also very aware of not wanting to overload players or the market.</p>

<p>With each new set there plans to be new Champion decks (whether it's two or three with each new set is currently in flux, but there was a reinforcement that they always wanted a Champion Deck with every new Set release) and potentially new iterations of the beginner friendly 2-4 player Proving Grounds box set.</p>

<p>While the current plans are for the Chinese and English release of <em>Riftbound </em>to reach release parity by Set 3 there's always global events that can shift those plans. Riot Games has stated that they want to meet that parity ASAP.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound </em>Organized Play</h2>

<p>There will be two levels of <em>Riftbound </em>Organized Play, the Local Play that occurs at your game shop, and Premier that starts with Regional Qualifiers and moves all the way up to the World Championship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-influencers.jpg?itok=88yR2s4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-influencers.jpg?itok=zN5I_AXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To support local playing there will be Release Events for each Set, Nexus Night (a weekly event) where participating players will get a three card booster pack, and Summoner Skirmish. Summoner Skirmish will take place at release, and then a month after and is focused at competitive play.</p>

<p>A unique approach to these Summoner Skirmishes is that you won't just be rewarded based on your final placing. But if you reach the Top 8, Top 4, etc you'll earn all of those rewards. That means if your deck is powerful enough to win you the Summoner Skirmish you'll walk away with a Participation Card, Top 8 Card, Top 4 Card, Finalist Card, Winner Card, and a Champion Playmat.</p>

<p>A key philosophy behind the Organized Play at the local level was also to give players a sense of momentum. Wins at the local level will offer you byes if you visit the Regional Qualifiers promoting your involvement in <em>Riftbound </em>at every level.</p>

<p>Regional Qualifiers are starting early in December. Based on how many participants attend a certain number of invites to Regional Championships will be distributed. An example given was that a Qualifier with 129 players might offer 4 players a spot in the Championship, but an event with 512 players might offer 16 invites.</p>

<p>This means that whether you're playing in a busy city with a bustling competitive scene or in a quieter area that there's a chance to earn that qualification.</p>

<p>There will be less Regional Championships for the first year; one in America and one in Europe. Past the first year they hope to reach two to three a year. You can attend the event as a participant, but for spectators they want to hold all kinds of other events.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-play-mats.jpg?itok=4jNqHjnZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-play-mats.jpg?itok=67kD3wM5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Prizes at the Regional Qualifiers include higher level promos, additional swap, cash prizing, and even 'Best of' prizing. This is intended to promote play that might be not the current optimal meta. If a player is using a Teemo deck, and is able to demonstrate skill at being the best Teemo and making it a long way even if they don't win, then there's opportunities for that player to be rewarded with swag themed for the Legend they're using.</p>

<h3>Organized Play Formats</h3>

<p>A number of Organized Play formats have been announced, those are:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Constructed - This is the standard tournament format for all solo Premier events, set rotation is only planned to begin in 2028</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Teams - A tournament format for Duo Premier events and side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sealed - A format for pre-release events and side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Multiplayer - For weekly events and will be a staple for side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Draft is currently still being worked on, but it will be intended for weekly events and side events</li>
</ul><p>While there's no timeline to any news on it at the Pre-Launch summit we also heard that there had been some testing internally about a PvE mode to allow players of different skill levels to participate together without fear of unfair competition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vtuber-usada-pekora-is-in-death-stranding-2-and-while-some-japanese-fans-hate-it-others-note-hideo-kojima-games-always-have-unexpected-crossovers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions recently announced that VTuber Usada Pekora will be making a guest appearance in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. However, this surprise cameo seems to have ruffled the feathers of some rather vocal Japanese Death Stranding fans on social media, some of whom are now proclaiming that they won’t buy the game anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usada Pekora is a Hololive VTuber whose carrot-loving avatar is an anime girl with rabbit ears. As well as singing, she often streams games and has recently been playing Elden Ring: Nightreign. Fitting with her hungry, mischievous rabbit girl avatar, she is known for frequently adding the made-up word “peko” into her sentences (which probably comes from the casual Japanese expression “pekopeko,” which means “very hungry”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in Kojima Productions’ video below, Pekora will appear as a hologram in Death Stranding 2, calling out greetings to Sam and thanking him for his hard work (she says “otsu<em>peko</em> deshita<em>”</em> instead of the actual Japanese phrase “otsukaresama deshita<em>”</em>).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">新たな繋がりを確認🐰<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeathStranding2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DeathStranding2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%882?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#デススト2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xy5lsFS2FK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xy5lsFS2FK</a></p>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (@KojiPro2015) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015/status/1928043652758036711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Japanese fans reacted strongly to the announcement of Usada Pekora’s cameo, with some commenters on X saying “I won’t buy Death Stranding 2 now.” Others elaborated on their reasons. “Death Stranding 2 is done for. When a game I planned to buy gets treated like this, I definitely won’t buy it,” said <a href="https://x.com/Usagi_chan_n/status/1928092742992941172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one user</u></a>. “Stop pandering to VTubers. I won’t buy it now,” added <a href="https://x.com/Matatab21859902/status/1928105131398287510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>. It could be that these users find the VTuber and her affected speech annoying, or feel that Pekora doesn’t match Death Stranding’s more serious tone. In response, defenders have been giving equally terse replies such as, “Then don’t buy it then!” and, “If you are not going to buy DS2 just because Pekora is in it, then don’t!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not the first time that Usada Pekora and Hideo Kojima have crossed paths. As reported by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/news/2505292o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a>, Pekora visited Kojima Productions back in August last year, posing with Kojima for the obligatory snap in front of Ludens.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">兎田ぺこらさんと🐇 <a href="https://t.co/S0JuGcBqVe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/S0JuGcBqVe</a></p>— 小島秀夫 (@Kojima_Hideo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1829421334730092634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Players familiar with Kojima’s work will know that his past games feature many unexpected crossovers, Easter eggs and bizarre elements. These include fourth wall-breaking mentions of other games, as well as the inclusion of real-life products and people (creepy developer “ghosts” in MGS2, anyone?). Metal Gear Solid 3 introduced the Kerotan frog character and featured the real-life Japanese snack Calorie Mate, both things that technically don’t match its 60s jungle setting — not to mention the Ape Escape monkeys that pop up in Snake Vs. Monkey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the first Death Stranding got Horizon: Zero Dawn-themed holograms, with the PC version getting even more crossover references to other games (Half Life, Portal, and Cyberpunk 2077) in the form of items. With Kojima’s penchant for putting all kinds of references and crossovers into his games, it seems likely that Usada Pekora will be one of many that players can discover in Death Stranding 2 when it releases on June 26.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, we reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a>'s ESRB rating, which suggests players will be able to use an unconventional melee weapon. Hideo Kojima is also working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions"><u>Death Stranding film with A24</u></a>, and we recently learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says"><u>Death Stranding anime is also in the works</u></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-how-to-unlock-the-dark-souls-skins.1205292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-unlock-the-dark-souls-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though deeply rooted in the Elden Ring universe and its Lands Between, the Elden Ring Nightreign setting allowed FromSoftware to make the game a celebration of its challenging Souls series, adding content lifted from games such as Dark Souls 3, among others. As you attempt to survive the Night and defeat the Nightlords, you will surely encounter some familiar faces from past games developed by the Japanese studio like the Nameless King and the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, but the content lifted from older games is not limited to bosses, as by achieving an extraordinary feat, you will be able to use skins inspired by the Dark Souls series, allowing you to turn Nightfarers into beloved characters like Solaire of Astoria and Sigmeyer of Catarina.</p>
<p><strong><em>WARNING: Light spoilers regarding Elden Ring Nightreign's content are ahead, so avoid reading if you don't want any potential surprises spoiled</em></strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603112654_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/">Unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign isn't really complicated</a>, but it's far from easy, as you will have to <strong>successfully defeat at least four Nightlords</strong> to be able to embark on the Night Aspect Expedition, where you will be able to fight the game's final boss, Heolstor the Nightlord. <strong>Defeat the true lord of the Night</strong>, and once you are back in Roundtable Hold, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/"><strong>access the mirror</strong></a><strong> to check the Dark Souls skins</strong> that are now available for purchase, and unlock them using Muck.</p>
<p>While unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign can be quite challenging, the effort is well worth it, especially if you are a fan of FromSoftware games. We may never get another entry in the Dark Souls series, but getting to play as some of its characters will make the pain of knowing that their stories are done a little more bearable.</p>

            <p>Last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got some behind the scenes updates, and as has become tradition, this little morsel of change has immediately raised hopes that maybe, just maybe, we will be getting some kind of release date news soon.</p>
<p>These SteamDB updates were spotted and subsequently shared on social media by Wario64, who noted that one of the updated packages had just received its first update in 15 months. So, what could this all mean? Well, of course it means that developer Team Cherry is gearing up for the game's imminent release. Right?</p>

<p>Since Wario64's post, there have been plenty of other social media users who have come to this conclusion. "SWITCH 2 SHADOW DROP," <a href="https://x.com/Papa_Kutz/status/1929773856367300618">one excited fan wrote</a> with an accompanying gif of The US Office's Michael Scott getting very hyped up about things finally happening. I mean, we do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Silksong is set for <em>both </em>Nintendo's consoles</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2 is set to release this week</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">a Silksong tease earlier this year</a>, so maybe…</p>
<p>That said, the game is also coming to other platforms as well, and <a href="https://x.com/Animator_Alex/status/1929770574777033112">others have suggested that either Summer Game Fest</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">during the Xbox showcase on Sunday</a> will be when Team Cherry finally releases Silksong out into the wild. <a href="https://x.com/reverie_mark/status/1929781696804934110">Others are less certain</a>, but "manifesting" a release this week all the same.</p> <div>

<p>It has now been six years and a bit since Hollow Knight: Silksong was first announced, and many have been eagerly waiting ever since. In January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">then finally assured us that Silksong was "real, progressing and will release"</a>.</p>
<p> So, do you think that release will be in just a few short days time?</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and co released a sizzle reel for Summer Game Fest, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">featured titles such as Death Stranding 2, Dune Awakening, Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name a handful. Silksong did not feature.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The battle for Super Earth that kicked off with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Heart of Democracy update concluded last week, with players managing to fend off an Illuminate invasion of their home planet. One of the two cities that ended up holding out against the hostile squids was Equality-On-Sea, located in the in-game map's version of China, and it's led <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">the shooter</a> to make a local news report in the country.</p>
<p>As spotted by players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1l1zad3/battle_for_super_earth_broadcasted_by_local_tv/">Helldivers 2 subreddit</a>, following the big victory for Super Earth, Chinese broadcaster Kanka News's Good Morning Shanghai anchors fronted <a href="https://www.kankanews.com/detail/dZ2e8qddBwR">a short segment</a> about these recent developments in the game. Based on a translation by a Reddit user with the handle AtypicalGameMaker (whose profile asserts that they're a Chinese game developer), the report discussed the defense of Equality-On-Sea, hailing both Chinese and non-Chinese players for working together to protect the city.</p>
<p>For some context, Equality-On-Sea and the Super Earth capital of Prosperity City were the only Super Earth cities left standing after the invasion. The defense of the former caused a bit of controversy, with a relatively small number of players <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-review-bombing-apparent-galactic-war-mixup">review bombing Helldivers 2</a> because they couldn't push the city's defense percentage gauge up to 100%, meaning it'd be fully under their control.</p>
<p>Members of the game's community suggested the root of this was that Equality-On-Sea was located in-game where Shanghai is in the real world, leading Chinese players to take its defense very seriously. An alleged translation mixup with the Chinese language version of the game seemingly also convinced these players that they could totally liberate the city while the battle for Super Earth was still in progress.</p>
<p>That last bit wasn't actually the case, with the constant flow of fresh Illuminate troops while the invasion was ongoing making it impossible to fully secure any mega cities at that stage of proceedings. Cue players getting frustrated as they believed their in-game efforts weren't having a dynamic effect on how the war was playing out, and some accusing developer Arrowhead of railroading them into certain outcomes.</p>
<p>The translation alludes to this apparent misunderstanding, citing the news anchors as having praised Helldivers 2 players for not following Arrowhead's Galactic War "script" and instead having "fought for their own story in an honorable way."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I quite like the way the report looks to have described the final stages of the big fight for Super Earth playing out: "Chinese players were battling the enemies during the daytime using their excellent shooting skills and strategic plans," the anchors allegedly said, "American players took over the nighttime operations, utilizing air drops and firepower to construct the defense line for Shanghai.</p>
<p>"This great unity of Chinese and American netizens came to a happy ending on the 30th." Nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has now had 3.5 million players, less than a week since its release.</p>
<p>FromSoftware shared the news in a social media post, which also confirmed duo expeditions will be added "at a later date".</p>
<p>The multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> is ostensibly a three-player game, though it's possible to play solo too. However, it's received plenty of criticism from players hoping to play as a duo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">FromSoftware stated it was considering adding a two-player mode post-launch</a>, with director Junya Ishizaki explaining it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>It seems, from this latest post, that the mode is on the way. It will follow the already announced DLC releasing later this year, as well as "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month".</p>
<p>The news suggests FromSoftware will be supporting the game with new content post-release.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">But the Night is far from over.<br>In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you can't wait that long, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-two-player-elden-ring-nightreign-pc-mod-is-already-available">PC players can already play the game with two players thanks to a fan-made mod</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign released last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">received two million players in its first day</a>. Initially, the game had a "Mixed" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash">reaction on Steam</a>, but it's now recovered to "Mostly Positive". Perhaps players just needed to give it time and appreciate the game for what it is, rather than what it supposedly lacks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">patched Elden Ring Nightreign to make it easier for solo players</a> - now there's a new automatic revive and an increase in runes gained. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">multiplayer remains the best way to experience the game</a>.</p>
