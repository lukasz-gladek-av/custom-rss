                <p>While everyone waits for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, Rockstar Games continues to grow and evolve GTA Online. The newest major expansion, Money Fronts, has now been announced, and it's coming very soon.</p><p>Due out June 17, Money Fronts has players taking control of a massive money laundering operation. The character <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Martin_Madrazo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Martin Madrazo</a> from the GTA 5 campaign shows up in the GTA Online DLC/</p><p>"With some creative bookkeeping and a little elbow grease, you'll end up further enriched and the taxman will be none the wiser," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511874" data-ratio="0.55482041587902" data-width="1058" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511874"></a><figcaption>The Money Fronts expansion is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg"></figure><p>Players will get started by taking over the Hands On Car Wash in Strawberry, turning it into a money laundering operation like something out of Breaking Bad. Players will use funds from the Car Wash to expand into other holdings like the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours.</p><p>As your empire grows, so does the challenge of avoiding the cops. If players attract too much attention, players have to focus more on the legitimate side of each business, Rockstar said.</p><p>The Money Fronts expansion also adds a bunch of new vehicles, including the Karin Everon RS and Woodlander SUVs, along with the Declasse Tampa GT.</p><p>Also coming to GTA Online with the Money Fronts update is a "collection of gameplay updates and changes," including the introduction of a missile lock-on jammer for 50 more vehicles. Additionally, the update will make "several" cutscenes skippable on replays, while arena points will be doubled.</p><p>The Money Fronts update launches June 17 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. As for GTA 6, following a delay, it's now set for release in May 2026.</p>

<p>"I had all these ideas," he said. "So I wrote them down and passed them to my PA, as if it were my will. I kind of understood why people commit suicide. It was the end of the world."</p><p>Kojima also developed serious eye pain that prevented him from going outside or watching movies or TV. He opted to have eye surgery, and this ended up damaging the optic muscles that allows a person to focus. "The doctor kept saying that the brain would adjust. I was not convinced," Kojima said.</p><p>Following his illness, Kojima said he now feels "nervous" and "rushed."</p><p>"I still have a lot of things I want to do--that I need to do. I thought I could do anything if I was independent, but the reality is that I can't," he said. "I always think of other, more weird stuff to make. But if I do that, and it doesn't sell, my studio will go bankrupt. I know all the staff. I know the families of the staff. I have this burden on my shoulders."</p><p>Kojima's next release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which releases this month on PS5. He said in the GQ interview that the game would have launched in 2023 were it not for COVID.</p><p>He's also working on multiple other upcoming games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, while he's involved with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-be-a-new-dimension-of-what-a-game-adaptation-can-be/1100-6528061/" data-ref-id="1100-6528061">A24 Death Stranding movie as well.</a></p>

The Hitman series is all about embodying a man of mystery who uses his cunning along with an array of weapons and gadgets to complete missions, so seeing the devs at IO Interactive apply their slick, open-ended balance of action and stealth to James Bond seems like we're in store of an evolution of the Hitman structure on a grander scale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to speak with IO Interactive Chief Technical Officer Ulas Karademir about the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In addition to giving some details on the upgraded engine that IO Interactive made for their dive into Bond, the CTO explained why he returned to the company following his departure to lead the upgrade of IO Interactive's Glacier engine, and why their Bond game offers a greater degree of freedom than the Hitman series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I left in 2014 [to work as the VP of engineering at Unity] during the development of Hitman 2016, but in the last year, I had come to the office to see what they were doing, and the first thing that Hakan B. Abrak—CEO of IO Interactive—showed me was the James Bond game," said Karademir. "He knew that I really wanted to work with this franchise, so he showed me the game, and then he asked me, "Do you want to come back?" and I was like, "Yeah, I think so." With everything we have planned [with the scope and increased agency], yeah, I think this is the right game for us."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on the origin story of James Bond, who appears as a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy into MI6. The pitch is heady: throughout his missions with the secret agency, he'll utilize a variety of gadgets, stealth tactics, weapon skills, and even social engineering to overcome the odds against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via IOI</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the most prolific Bond games have focused heavily on action-laden spectacle, and while the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> trailer certainly showcased shootouts and over-the-top sequences, the developers were firm in stating the game is about giving players options to engage in each mission. The core gameplay is very much in line with Hitman's immersive sim approach of exploring clockwork levels where players take advantage of NPC behavior to accomplish missions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers told us the title leans even further into the agent fantasy than Hitman, all with the intent to highlight Bond as a multifaceted secret agent who can adapt to different situations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-remedy-entertainment-built-fbc-firebreak-around-the-player-s-schedule-not-the-other-way-around" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why Remedy Entertainment built FBC Firebreak around the player's schedule, not the other way around</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a [lot] more options in this game compared to Hitman," Karademir said. "You can play the game with a stealth approach, or you can do social interactions with Bond trying to bluff his way out of situations, which creates situations with humor and interactions like that.

			<p><span>No other game developer dared to reveal their newest game at Summer Game Fest by teasing players three times with an anniversary message, followed by a sale announcement for previous titles in the series, and then ending the two-hour showcase with an actual world premiere look at their latest survival horror game. While Resident Evil Requiem’s initial reveal may have been cheapened by all the teasing beforehand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">the reveal</a> was worth it.</span></p>
<p><span>Following our&nbsp;</span><span>brief look</span>&nbsp;at <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, we were greeted behind closed doors with another look at the trailer, announced earlier in the week, along with the first sneak peek at gameplay for the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p><span>While Resident Evil VII: Biohazard’s connections to the Resident Evil universe were muted early on and left players wondering how it was connected to the legacy of S.T.A.R.S. and the Umbrella Corporation, Requiem starts by introducing the player character as Grace Ashcroft, a young FBI investigator and daughter of the late Alyssa Ashcroft, one of the varied protagonists from the Resident Evil Outbreak series (and eagle-eyed fans might recognize the byline as one of the reporters of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dulvey_Daily">The Dulvey Daily</a>, a newspaper for the local parish where the Baker family resides in Resident Evil VII Biohazard. Capcom aims for a “fresh, vulnerable perspective” on the Resident Evil series by introducing a character already haunted by a major family tragedy, yet not a fighter in the traditional sense, but rather a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span>The demo opened with Grace Ashcroft being suspended upside down on a hospital gurney with an IV in her right arm. The developers made a point to highlight Grace’s training in the FBI to try and stay cool under pressure through breathing techniques and self-talk to cool down. She then tries to tip the stretcher over to stop the blood from rushing down to her head, and uses the shards of a broken glass vial to cut her bindings free, all through an in-game cut scene before the gameplay transitions into a first-person perspective as Grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This section of Resident Evil Requiem takes place in an abandoned hospital, although it only appears to have been abandoned somewhat recently. There are still a bevvy of locked doors that mark a series’ long-running tradition, both ones with broken handles and others with elaborate door handles or stone carvings to indicate which key is needed. And it wouldn’t be a Resident Evil game without needing to replace fuses in a fuse box to turn on the lights or open an electronic shutter, so I’m proud to say that these puzzles are back once again. Grace isn’t one to have deep pockets on her, so she only has a modest eight-slot inventory to hold onto these key items, at least to start.</span></p>
<p><span>Grace Ashcroft doesn’t have the same combat training that Ethan Winters underwent between Resident Evil Biohazard and Village, so she instead will have to rely on more practical weapons, such as throwing empty bottles. A small UI tip showed both a power and radius for the bottle, so I would assume there would be a variety of these weapon types at her disposal. To navigate the darkened halls, Grace picked up a lighter with the same ornate emblems as one of the gates around the hospital, although we couldn’t make out what that symbol was.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of Resident Evil Requiem was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In a scene that will be all too familiar as players experience the horror for themselves, Grace is slain by this hulking monster as the screen fades away. The audience is reminded that this was merely the overture to their darkest symphony to date. Resident Evil Requiem's demo session ended with a quick continue back to moments before disaster and a cheeky peek at the options to turn on a third-person camera mode. Yes, while Capcom is leading with the first-person perspective of the past few titles, third-person gameplay will be available from the start, and you can even spin the camera around and see Grace’s face, unlike the enigmatic Ethan Winters for most of his adventures.</span></p>
<p><span>Resident Evil Requiem will be available on February 27th, 2026, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-miyamoto-musashi-mayhem.1215585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/onimusha-way-of-sword-preview-miyamoto-musashi-mayhem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just recently, I had the chance to review&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2</em>'s new remaster, and less than an hour in I was sold on this franchise. Since my passion for&nbsp;the series is so new, I am greatly anticipating the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, we had a chance to see a hands-off gameplay demonstration of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. It's bold and action-packed. It's the series you know and love, redefined for the modern age.</p>



<h2>The Legendary Swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi</h2>

<p>Producer Koichi Shibata was playing the live demo for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>. The setting appears to be largely in Kyoto. Our protagonist is one of Japan's most legendary historical figures: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>This is Musashi in his younger years, so he's more concerned with training with the blade, rather than the Oni Gauntlet attached to his arm.</p>

<p>Fans familiar with the series will recognize the Oni Gauntlet. It's the means by which our protagonist absorbs the souls of Genma, the enemies of the series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gauntlet appears to have a personality, so we see a bit of banter between Musashi and the feminine voice residing inside of it. This dynamic is intriguing, and Musashi seems like a silly fellow in this one.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>&nbsp;is already a quirky series, so there's great potential in the storytelling.</p>

<p>In this demo, the players works their way through the grounds of a shrine or temple, called Kiyomizudera Shockingly, Genma are attacking people and Musashi is ready to dive into the action.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Return of the Issen</h2>

<p>Returning players will find many familiar elements from the series return in this installment. Musashi can hack and slash away with his sword as a basic attack. Enemies, of course, drop colored souls which are absorbed in the gauntlet.</p>

<p>He's able to parry, and in one instance of combat, we see&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;leverage its next-gen capabilities. Musashi parries a blow from a Genma and redirects the enemy into a flaming torch. The enemy takes extra damage, so environmental damage adds a bit more depth to the combat.</p>

<p>In another instance of combat, an archer draws its bow and aims at Musashi. It's inside a small building, so Musashi grabs the tatami mat, blocks the arrows, then throws the mat at the Genma. This makes the Genma vulnerable to your attack and stuns them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the most iconic element of&nbsp;the series, the Issen counter, also makes a return. Attacking an enemy right as they are about to hit you allows for a cinematic attack that usually one-hit kills lesser enemies. The hands-on demo makes it look easy, but I imagine that's from many hours of practice.</p>

<p>We saw Musashi use an Issen on multiple enemies at once; essentially, you can chain together an Issen attack on foes in close proximity to one another. This allows for you to take out multiple foes in quick succession, like the badass that you are.</p>



<h2>Terrifyingly Good Graphics</h2>

<p>Flying Genma -- the annoying little buggers that they are -- make a return and absorb souls from fallen foes. The way Musashi attacks and defeats these enemies are especially cinematic.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;is a seriously gorgeous game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, this might just be Capcom's best looking game yet. The forest surrounding the temple is gorgeous. Capcom uses light fog and lighting to create an astonishing view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite enemy we saw were these crow-like humanoids. They're swift and can evade attacks. There's this doppleganger-like effect where you try to hit them, but the real one comes just out of reach. It's a tricky fight for Musashi!</p>

<p>We carry on through the shrine grounds, this time coming across a dark mass. Musashi can absorb these masses and get a glimpse into the past. It seems like absorbing these might be a main objective of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Absorbing the mass shows dark, shadowy figures on the shrine grounds. We reach a larger building in the shrine and see the Genma are throwing peasants over the edge of a railing, down a cliff.</p>

<p>This is actually inspired by real folklore of the area, something I was vaguely familiar with. But our trance is soon interrupted as Musashi's longtime rival, Ganryu Sasaki, appears. He has his own Oni Gauntlet and, apparently, fully embraces its power.</p>



<h2>Battle of the Oni</h2>

<p>An exhilarating sword fight ensues. This battle really seems to really capture the feeling of a duel, with the warriors trading blows, parrying and the like. We also noticed that Ganryu has a health and stamina gauge, giving me vague hints of&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>&nbsp;inspiration.</p>

<p>The battle is flashy. Ganryu's helmet breaks off from your fight. Depleting his stamina gauge also allows you to do a targeted strike; you can actually choose where on his body to attack. These are color-coded and give you orbs of a particular color.</p>

<p>So if you need health during a boss fight, targeting the corresponding color will give you orbs to heal. Stabbing Ganryu in the head or abdomen were choices here, adding a little strategic element to combat.</p>



<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>We also look at one final boss encounter after Ganryu. As if reality itself is shattering like glass, malice starts to ooze out of a fissure and out comes Byakue, a large, axe-wielding Genma boss.</p>

<p>This fight features more and more parries and clashes. The parrying of attacks really stands out hear, and there seem to be so many different animations. It's quite exciting to watch, so I can only imagine how fun it is to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;had an impressive showing, and is perhaps my favorite game of the show. It's a game that shows so much dedication to the craft and doesn't deviate from what&nbsp;made&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>such a coveted IP in the first place: some good ol' action-packed demon slaying.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the largest surprises of the Summer Game Fest Showcase was the announcement and debut of a <em>Resident Evil 9 Requiem</em> trailer. Shortly after the public trailer was released, we got a chance to visit the Capcom theater to see not only live Onimusha gameplay but also a segment of gameplay from <em>Resident Evil 9</em>.</p>

<p>The gameplay segment opened with Grace hanging upside down and strapped to a hospital gurney. This scene was&nbsp;<em>tense</em>. Lingering on Graces face, and the subject of her attention, while she didn't say anything there was a clear conveyance of everything that was going through Grace's mind as she planned her escape.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=oFgfXfsq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=r4bHeKtl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace waking up, strapped to a gurney upside down, and hooked up to an IV slowly taking her blood</figcaption></figure><p>This portion of the cutscene was so precise. By pulling on the line from the IV drip in her arm, she was able to tip over and break the glass that was collecting her blood. Using the line again, she gathered up shattered glass to cut her wrists loose. Another free hand and a quick topple of the gurney, and Grace was free.</p>

<p>At this point, the experience shifted into a first-person view. Turning around, Grace began to make her way through a series of corridors. They were filled with the stable <em>Resident Evil</em> fare, tight corners, a door with a sigil that needed a key of the matching design, and a 16-foot monstrous woman that stalked Grace through the halls.</p>

<p>For many in the room the introduction of this monster was quite the jumpscare. After opening a door, Grace had a dead body collapse onto her, inspecting it on the ground a large hand quietly reached out of the darkness and with no effort picked up the dead body before raising it to her mouth and biting the head clean off. Grace's non-reaction through this process is a mix of panic and awe (much like those watching) as she's just trying to take in the abomination in front of her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=dtT_Z7hg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=y2iYz97p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This section of the demo shown was structured in equal parts puzzle, as Grace tried to escape this portion of the building she was in, while also doubling down on the idea of wanting to escape from the daunting and monstroust figure that was stalking her.</p>

<p>Within the same diverting hallways, with 3-5 rooms adjacent we got to see Grace find a locked door, return with a key, locate a fuse trapped behind a locked case, obtained a screw driver, unlocked the fuse, and then made her way to a gate that is in need of a fuse.</p>

<p>While there was a lot of movement to and from the different rooms within this portion of the building, each time Grace made it to a key objective, she would be faced with a small challenge, or she would only reach the location while trying to steer clear of the monstrous woman.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=ApwAR4I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=MJj5u4bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Resident Evil 9's Mr X?</figcaption></figure><p>We didn't get to see Grace do much to mitigate the oncoming threat, but for this segment of the gameplay, it seemed the idea of Grace's character was to not be the most competent when it comes to combat, but to be able to nimbly escape.</p>

<p>There were a number of cuts between footage while viewing this <em>Resident Evil 9</em> gameplay, the key information that was missing from the footage was things like the location of the key for the locked door, or when there was some repetitive backtracking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=BYlBC4oJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=aPW7C7w2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A key was obtained, but it's location obscured</figcaption></figure><p>There were a few moments when it did seem that there were some selective cuts around some additional context. Grace entered a room filled with medical equipment and while she was standing still there were some additional squealching noises. They didn't seem like they were coming from here, but they also seemed too frequent and light, they weren't coming from the giant humanoid creature.</p>

<p>This section had unsettling moment, some of the darkest corridors I've seen in games, and a plethora of jump scares as your way would get blocked by the monster.</p>

<h2>Resident Evil Requiem has First Person Mode and Third Person Mode</h2>

<p>A very interesting aspect of the gameplay clip, and one that was heralded by applause in the small showing room, was that by entering the pause menu and going to options the gameplay was able to be shifted to third person mode.</p>

<p>Once in third person and running from the monstrous woman Grace found her way to the fuse box, placed it inside, and was able to escape as the demo came to a close. The last thing that remained on the screen was "This is merely the overture to our dark symphony".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=fTMXSXk2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=hFMZsGp6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace in the hallway with the locked door, just around the corner to the left is where the fusebox can be found</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay made me think of early Ethan Winters style gameplay for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a560db9-346a-4407-98cb-00ff8b36ed59" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a>. There was a lot of need to avoid combat, knowing that whatever it was you weren't going to want to take the face on. Grace, with her experience in the FBI, definitely has a lot of knowledge and skill under her belt, but a Resident Evil outbreak is definitely out of her comfort zone.</p>

<p>While we didn't see too much of the menus or additional mechanics when approaching the door without the key we got to see an empty inventory screen that looked like the ones being used in recent <em>Resident Evil</em> titles, and the one time that Grace was hit by the enemy a pulse meter in orange appeared in the lower left.</p>

<p>It looks like the UI will be aiming to be a light as possible, only showing relevant elements when necessary.</p>

The game has peaked at around 3,000 concurrent on Steam so far, which is where <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> was less than a month after launch. “I refuse to believe this game went through actual playtesting,” wrote another Steam user. “It’s not possible.”</p><p><em>MindsEye</em> follows ex-soldier Jacob Diaz, a man with a mysterious implant who’s losing his mind. He heads to the Vegas-inspired near-future city of Redrock to unravel what’s happening to him and engage in all sorts of intrigue, action, and open-world driving. Despite obvious comparisons to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, given the large map and third-person view, its more akin to a <em>Mafia</em> game in that if you go off the beaten path you will not actually encounter all that much. It’s a big world but an empty one, propelled by a cutscene-heavy story campaign that takes up to 15 hours. </p><p>Many were hoping <em>MindsEye</em> would end up being an AA shooter that punched above its weight.

Don’t let them cross the gate, commander!</p><p>Play as Dio, a young commander inspired by the old heroes from Greek mythos like Achilles, Hector, and Perseus. He uses spears, swords and shields to slay thousands of monsters attacking the city of Ithaca. Dio has yet to discover his true power with a wide selection of gear to be used, godlike powers to be summoned and entire new armies to be drafted for battle. This is a war for the fate of mankind.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The monsters that will try to breach your defense are many and varied. You’ll need to think carefully about combat tactics and power balance, especially when dealing with legendary bosses.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Slay Monsters And Defend The Gate</strong><ul><li>The most important goal is to not let the enemy pass through the gate. Fight against the beasts and legendary tribes from Greek mythology. They will use all their might to break through your ranks and shatter the line of defense.</li><li>In battles, you must lead your army and think of the right strategies to face different enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Get The Best Gear</strong><ul><li>The mundane weapons of the world are not enough to repel the attacks of the mighty monsters. Dio needs the weapons with deadly power, the artifacts blessed by the Gods themselves.</li><li>Besides strategically arranging the armies, you’ll need to upgrade them through battles to match the stronger and more unusual enemies. The classic skill tree upgrade system combined with the sets of war technique provide the required versatility. Changing them will open up tactical options and let your defenders vanquish the ever-changing monster waves.</li><li>Make your own build with a combination of skills and become a powerful adversary for your enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fight Your Foes</strong><ul><li>Your enemies are the beasts and legendary races from Greek mythology who conflicted with humans since the dawn of time and have long wanted to exterminate them. The legions of the dead started this war, gathered the army and attacked Ithaca in great numbers. The beasts and monsters from around the region took advantage of the opportunity to advance their forces.</li><li>Pay special attention to the bosses. They are creatures of legend that caused much suffering to mankind. Now, they will use their impetuous primordial strength to break through our defenses.</li><li>Stop them from destroying our homeland and killing our people at any cost.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Find Out The Truth</strong><ul><li>The Trojan War is over.</li><li>Odysseus, king of Ithaca, became a legend because of his trick with the Trojan horse. Having returned from Troy, Odysseus regained the throne of Ithaca, but peace did not last long…</li><li>An unexpected event led to Odysseus’s death at the hand of his illegitimate son.

			<p>CCP Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, its new space survival MMO, has now opened public access with 'Founder Access: New Era' following the previous Closed Alpha stage.</p>
<p>EVE Frontier is set in an enigmatic and hostile galaxy shaped by its players' activities. Players inhabit Riders: awakened clones flung into the Frontier without purpose or memory of the world around them. As they explore the darkness, they must construct shelters, form Tribes, and gather resources to increase their power and survive the ever-present danger of annihilation.</p>
<p>Founder Access: New Era also introduces a brand-new seasonal progression system for EVE Frontier called Cycles. The first cycle, Promised Lands, begins today. Players will earn Grace by completing in-game missions and activities and rise to the top of each Cycle Leaderboard alongside their Tribe. As the New Era progresses, new missions, objectives, and content will be introduced in subsequent Cycles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by sweeping layoffs affecting around a third of the company's staff, parent company Sony has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Sony says the layoffs are part of "strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success", a pretty standard corporate line. The company goes on to say that the "workforce reduction" was a decision that was "not made lightly", and that those being laid off made "meaningful contributions" to Bend Studio.</p>

<p>Sony did not, however, confirm the exact scope of the layoffs. That figure comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who said on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;that "around 40 people", i.e. 30% of Bend Studio's staff, had been laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=-bKvUQga 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=KZQIiDpL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come after Sony canceled two of its in-development live-service projects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>, one of which was in the works at Bend Studio. In the statement given to Kotaku, Sony said it made the decision not to proceed with Bend's game following "careful consideration".</p>

<p>According to Schreier, Bend Studio is currently working on a new project that it started following the live-service game's cancellation, and Sony says it remains "confident in [Bend Studio's] future and creative direction", so it sounds as though the studio is still working on a game of some sort.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Bend Studio come after a wider wave that has swept across the industry, affecting smaller studios like&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Night School</a>, as well as larger companies like EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>Bend Studio's game is also not the only live-service project Sony has canceled in recent months. As well as the other game shut down at the same time as Bend's, live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down mere days after its launch</a> last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sony-live-service-marathon-bend-studio.jpg?itok=l0ueWu41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sony-live-service-marathon-bend-studio.jpg?itok=Nn_XyPE2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's next upcoming live-service game is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these cancellations and shutdowns, Sony is still putting many of its eggs into the live-service basket. Its next live-service project is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>; as far as we know, that's still the case, despite lukewarm reception to previews and the recent revelation that an artist who previously worked on the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">stole artwork from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of game Bend Studio is working on next, but there will be a lot of folks hoping it's a&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>sequel. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo introduced a new hardware button to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the Switch 2</a> specifically for chatting with your friends, and it’s undoubtedly my favorite feature on the console. Instead of using a smartphone app like the original Switch, Switch 2 users can open up a communications channel at any time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the “C” button</a> and chat with friends, whether they’re playing the same game or something else.</p><p>That idea sounds a little outdated with the popularity of Discord, but Nintendo makes the process seamless enough that I can imagine a lot of people will end up using it. Last Friday, a few of my colleagues and I hopped into a GameChat session together and played <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> online — all of us communicating through the built-in microphone on our consoles and various USB webcams, with our likeness displayed on the bottom of the screen.</p><p>The noise reduction and compression processing on the Switch 2’s mic was surprisingly impressive: my audio was clear and easy to understand without any background noise, even when sitting 5-10 feet away from the console. The Switch 2’s face detection and background removal with its camera works well, too, and it was hilariously useful when a cutout of our faces showed up over our Mario Kart characters during a race. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Jay and Sean speeding past me in </em>Mario Kart World <em>while on GameChat. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>GameChat’s screensharing feature, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The frame rate for each user’s gameplay feed is very low and compressed, making it choppy and hard to follow. Nintendo seems to be limiting the video feeds for a steadier and more consistent experience, but this didn’t actually prevent dropouts. My colleague Cameron’s video feed was interrupted multiple times, and he had to rejoin the session for his camera stream or gameplay to display again. I later came across this problem myself. Nintendo also limits the amount of users who can share video to four per session; eight more can join the chat but only stream their audio.</p><p>The feature is free right now, but only for a limited time. After March 31st, 2026, Switch 2 users will need to pay for a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use GameChat. Console gamers are used to paying for online play, but having to pay to use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">a button on the controller</a> expands just how much of the console experience is locked behind a subscription. </p><p>Despite those limits, I can imagine a world where my best friend calls me on my Switch 2 to make dinner plans or to play a strategic round of Splatoon. This setup also becomes a perfect setup for a Twitch stream. The low-stakes, easy setup voice call is a delightful and useful addition to Nintendo’s updated console, and has the potential to be a central hub for a lot of new ways to play games like <em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Now, I just need to convince my manager to open up a GameChat for our weekly creative meeting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To kick things off, players <a href="https://shop.marvelsnap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can log into the Web Shop</a> and claim the following free items with the promo code <strong>WEBLAUNCH</strong>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB6daEk16kI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IB6daEk16kI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>1 x Premium Mystery Variant</li><li>1 x Premium Mystery Border</li><li>3 x high-value one-time purchase bundles</li><li>Daily Free Claim Boost: 200 Credits per day</li></ul><p>The freebies available here are pretty good, as these items normally cost quite a bit when using the in-game "Gold" currency. A Premium Mystery variant on its own costs 800 Gold, and that's a sum that typically takes around a month to earn in the game if you don't buy the monthly season pass. Also on the horizon is a weekly promotional event called Web Shop Wednesdays, and players will be able to claim a free Common Mystery Border for one of their cards. A $5 bundle will also be offered, and this includes a Common Mystery Border and 600 Gold.</p><p>Second Dinner has made several big changes to Marvel Snap since it first launched in 2022, with one of the biggest being a complete overhaul of how cards are acquired. Players can now earn Collector's Tokens that can be used to purchase cards, and regular play makes it easy enough to unlock at least one of the older cards every week. The newer cards require more grinding, but earning them is still much easier compared to the older system that was in place.</p><p>Marvel Snap's current season, Masters of the Arcane, also began earlier this month, and it focuses on several of Marvel's mystical characters like Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, and Nicholas Scratch.</p>

<p>"It should have been an OLED screen from the get-go"</p>

<figure><a title="Poll: Are You Happy With Switch 2's Screen? Because Some People Certainly Aren't 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc28822f1aab7/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Nintendo Switch 2</a> that has generated a <em>lot</em> of interest is its display. While Nintendo released an OLED model of the original Switch, which massively improved over the launch model's LCD screen, for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-switch-2s-screen-isnt-oled-but-it-will-support-1080p120fps-gameplay">it has opted to return to LCD technology</a>.</p>
<p>On the whole, it's fair to say that the decision has gone down fairly well; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">as we reported after our first hands-on sessions</a>, the panel used in the Switch 2 is <em>leagues</em> ahead of the one we got back in 2017, with superb brightness and bold colours.</p>
<p>However, due to the way LCD screens work, a little bit of blurriness is inevitable; OLED panels exhibit almost instant pixel response, which cuts down on blur (but, on the downside, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/psa-sensitive-to-pwm-flicker-youll-want-to-keep-the-switch-oleds-screen-nice-and-bright">generates a flicker which can actually give some people headaches</a>). In contrast, LCD screens have slower pixel response, and this can manifest itself as a blurred image when things move fast.</p>
<p>This issue has been flagged by more than one person since the console launched last week:</p>



<p>As noted by Cary Golomb, it is believed that Nintendo is utilising two different screen suppliers for Switch 2: Innolux and Sharp. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lpleplmndc2h">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, the quality gap between these two options isn't as large as many people would have you believe, but the fact that there are two versions has predictably led to some comparing this to the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-screen-lottery-its-a-thing-and-it-sucks.57152/">'screen lottery'</a> which occurred when both the Nintendo DS and 3DS were released.</p>
<p>You can see how the Switch 2's LCD panel compares with the Switch OLED in the video below:</p>

<p>As we've already established, there will be some blur on the Switch 2's screen when compared to an OLED panel—that's beyond debate—but is it enough to cause serious complaints?</p>
<p>I'm personally pretty happy with the Switch 2's display, but I have noticed that it's a little blurry when things are moving at high speed. It obviously depends heavily on the game you're playing; I could barely notice it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but it was more obvious when playing Switch 1 games with 2D artwork (the overworld map in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/unicorn_overlord">Unicorn Overlord</a> is especially bad, to my eyes).</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For context, Dune: Awakening is proving much more popular than Dune: Spice Wars, which is a strategy title. The latter topped out with 8,397 concurrent players on Valve's storefront, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1605220/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. As such, Dune: Awakening appears to be the biggest game ever for the Dune franchise--with four other games based on the sci-fi series coming out between 1992 and 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Funcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/">Dune: Awakening will arrive on home consoles in 2026</a>. That said, the studio hasn't stated exactly which systems will get the game, though PS5 and Xbox Series X|S would make the most sense. As for Switch 2, that seems more up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-multiplayer-guide-how-to-party-up-with-friends/1100-6532181/">Dune: Awakening guide for partying up with friends</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-is-now-nintendos-fastest-selling-console-worldwide.1215474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 has become the gaming giant's fastest-selling console worldwide, having reached a major milestone in just four days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1932620051955270127" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo says the Switch 2 sold 3.5 million copies within the first four days of its release, thus making it the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever" around the world.</p>

<p>The console has also set records for Nintendo in specific regions of the globe; earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling machine in the UK, although it hasn't pipped the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S to the post as the country's fastest-selling games console ever.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=WxQygTUk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=9C0bqQLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling Nintendo console around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on the Switch 2's launch, it's Nintendo's newest console. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th</a>, the console packs more powerful internals than its predecessor, as well as a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Cons, and various other improvements.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launched with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>as its main draw, but it also has a number of last-gen and current-gen ports under its belt, and a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">original Switch games</a> have received either free or paid upgrades to enhance their performance on the new console.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the console will go on to fulfil Nintendo's expectations. The company said last month that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell 15 million</a> Switch 2 units in its first year, and a Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested that Nintendo is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">preparing to manufacture 20 million units</a> for sale in the same time period.</p>

<p>This is a strong start for the Switch 2, though, and even if it hasn't beaten the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo will be happy that the new machine appears to have outsold the original Switch, at least in terms of the first four days.</p>




<p>You can grab a Switch 2 right now from any number of retailers (assuming the console is in stock at the time you're reading this, of course).</p>

Every expansion in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has changed how the game plays so much that very few cards from the base Genetic Apex set see use today. Still, some cards have held their ground despite the power creep, and you’ll undoubtedly sow fear into the eyes of your foes by bringing them into battle. Here are five monsters that are well worth bringing into your deck.</p><h2 id="h680829"><a id="1"></a>Rampardos</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown: Dialga</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Rampardos is so strong that you could be tricked into thinking it’s an ex card. Its damage potential is on par with Giratina, and you only need a <em>single energy </em>for it to attack. Additionally, it packs respectable survivability at 150 HP. 50 damage recoil <em>does </em>admittedly sting, but since this only triggers on a KO, Rampardos can still headbutt way above its weight class against bulky opponents.</p><figure id="" data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This monster was already good when it debuted in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, and the introduction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> has only made it better. Nearly every Fighting-type deck is built around this monster as of writing, and it’s easy to see why.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Cards that evolve from fossils are always risky, and Rampardos is no exception. You can’t use a Pokéball to get a fossil in your hand, and it’s vulnerable to a quick KO via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina</a></span> if you have nothing else on your bench.

Given the overwhelming prevalence of Supporter cards in the average <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>deck, boosting that 50 damage to 100 damage is remarkably easy. And since it only needs two colorless energy to attack, it can slot into any deck that needs a secondary attacker. Want to pair the overwhelming power of Rampardos with Sivally? You can, and many players do!</p><figure id="" data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all these perks, Silvally is only a Stage-1 evolution too. That is to say, it can get on the field relatively fast and won’t compete with any Rare Candy users. Even its pre-evolutionary form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type: Null</a></span> packs respectable bulk while outputting acceptable damage in the early game.

These two monsters are far from invincible together, especially if your opponent gets their strongest attackers on the front lines early on. But just putting Oricorio on the field will force your opponent to change their playstyle, which can net you wins if they don’t have an established gameplan for dealing with the bird.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Magnezone is the rare Stage-2 monster that does <em>not </em>want to use Rare Candy, so it’s slower to get up and running than other meta-dominant evolutions. Spending an extra turn to evolve might not seem like a big deal, but <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is so fast-paced now that you want to build momentum in your favor as soon as you can. Further, just placing Magneton on the field may compel your opponent to use cards that make you shuffle your deck, potentially tossing Magnezone out of your hand right as you were counting on playing it.</p><hr><h2 id="h680832"><a id="4"></a>Meowscarada</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Shining Revelry</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the best ex-counters in the game so far.

This is fine for picking off basic Pokémon before they can evolve into Stage-2 forms, and two-shotting Pokémon like Oricorio isn’t bad. However, this still leaves room for your opponent to chip away at Meowscarada before finally bringing in an ex Pokémon to blast it away.</p><p>Mewoscarada typically pairs with other grass-type attackers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decidueye ex</a></span> who can cover the cat’s weaknesses and greatly benefit from its strengths.

Of course, what you’re really bringing the ninja frog along for is its <strong>Water Shuriken </strong>ability. This lets Greninja attack <em>any </em>of your opponent’s Pokémon, even as it sits safely on the bench.

Its base form <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Froakie</a></span> is mostly a liability until it evolves, and 120 HP after evolution is low enough for most leading damage dealers to one-shot it. Greninja can pick off foes in a pinch in the active slot, but otherwise you’ll want this frog’s big tongue parked on a stacked bench where it’s safe from a surprise Sabrina switch-in.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over 5 million copies, Capcom has announced. That’s up from the 4 million reported in September 2024. The latest sales milestone was helped by the fighting game’s launch on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom said it aimed to “maximize the game’s userbase” by bringing Street Fighter 6, now two years old, to the Switch 2 at launch. The Switch 2 version has exclusive modes designed for the console, and new gameplay features that utilize the gyro functionality of the Joy-Con 2. It’s worth noting the Switch 2 version has crossplay, maximising the pool of players available for matchmaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These initiatives have contributed to Street Fighter 6’s wide appeal, expanded global sales and resulted in the title achieving the milestone of 5 million units sold,” Capcom said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold"><u>Street Fighter 6 hit 3 million copies sold back in January</u></a> 2024, seven months after launch. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is “generally progressing in line with our expectations,” but before launch it revealed it had aimed for the sequel to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, still has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 has sold 7.8 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1"><u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a>, which has also sold 5 million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. But Mortal Kombat 1 is seen as a sales disappointment, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">developer NetherRealm recently confirmed it had left it behind to work on its next project</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, meanhwile, continues to support Street Fighter 6 into its third year, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-year-3-roster-for-street-fighter-6">recently announced a set of four brand new DLC characters</a>: Sagat is out this summer; C. Viper this fall; Alex early spring 2026; and finally, Ingrid late spring 2026. The announcement was made in a trailer starring pro wrestler Kenny Omega, who dressed up as each DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
