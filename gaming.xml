            <p>Ubisoft's lawyers have responded to a legal action from players of defunct racing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> by insisting that those players never owned the game in the first place. The players made their lawsuit to complain about the game being made unplayable when servers were shut down last year, but Ubisoft have now responded to argue that the game was only "licensed" to those playing, and players should never have expected the game to be useable in perpetuity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft's legal team made the argument in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon">a motion to have the case dismissed</a>, as seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"The Crew's ordinary, intended purpose was to provide consumers with a revocable, limited license to access its content pursuant to the unmistakable warnings on the product packaging and Ubisoft's Terms of Use," reads part of the filing. "Plaintiffs received just that for years, and Ubisoft therefore provided The Crew consistent with and fit for its ordinary, advertised purpose."</p>
<p>Ubisoft go on to argue that the game being under a non-permanent licence was clearly stated on some of their packaging. They also say that the statute of limitations to make this sort of complaint is up, and that the shutdown of the game caused no "cognizable injury" and therefore the case should be dismissed by the California district court which is looking at it. The plaintiffs make a counter-argument that some vouchers for the game had an expiry date of "2099", which implies the statute of limitations is not up.</p>
<p>Ubisoft made The Crew unplayable when it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">took the servers offline</a> last year, ending 10 years of support for the open world racing game. It started disappearing from game libraries shortly afterwards, making any hopes of a fan preservation movement (as sometimes happens with defunct MMOs) more unlikely. Eventually, some players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-is-being-sued-over-the-crew-in-a-lawsuit-that-compares-the-server-shutdown-to-a-bumperless-pinball-machine">launched the class-action lawsuit</a> which Ubi are now trying to get dismissed. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p>
<p>It may be a significant legal case in the event it's brought to court proper (although these things are often settled or dismissed before it gets that far). Valve make similar "it's only a license" arguments about all those unplayed JRPGs clogging up your Steam library, and now show <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">a more prominent warning</a> that you're actually only buying a digital license when you buy a game on their store. This is also the reason why you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-leave-your-steam-backlog-to-someone-else-in-your-will">won't be able to legally pass on your Steam library</a> after you die in that terrible go-karting accident, at least according to Valve. </p>
<p>Our worries over whether or not you actually own anything you download can be traced back to time immemorial (or at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thought-do-we-own-our-steam-games">back to 2012</a>). And Ubisoft's latest comments are a further digging in of corporate heels on this legality. As for The Crew itself, it was an OK racing game - nothing very special in my book - but I do have fond memories of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-free-road-trip">a cross-country road trip</a> in the game with Adam (RPS in peace).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A port of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD on Nintendo Switch 2 is still a possibility, despite the original GameCube release being added to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/">Nintendo Switch Online library.</a></p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinda Funny Games</a> during last week's press event, which allowed media to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD could still be released on the new system, as all options are on the table. While the port hasn't been confirmed, it has been highlighted how games being available via the Nintendo Switch Online service hasn't prevented other versions of said games from being released on the original Switch, so there's still hope to see the remaster breaking free from the Wii U captivity it has been since its release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 Reviews Are In! - Kinda Funny Games Daily 04.08.25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=2477&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, we have been hearing rumors of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess HD getting ported to Nintendo Switch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">quite some time</a>, but neither game has ever materialized, leaving fans no other option than playing the Wii U releases. While both games feature plenty of improvements over the original releases, Zelda: Wind Waker HD definitely sports the most significant changes, with plenty of gameplay improvements that make it, together with the enhanced visuals, the definitive way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series to date.</p>

<p>The clip kicks off mid-quest. We're on what looks like a mining planet, all sandstone cliffs and crystalline bunches. Indulging in a little showcasey arsenal appreciation, we admire our knife, a slimy slime pistol, and a glowing Toys R Us does Art Deco Scythe. Art Deco's the theme, actually. We soon approach an open plaza overlooked by a mythologising mural that evokes similar art from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a>'s Talos I.</p>
<p>"Everything must become nothing, before it can become everything," blasts a tannoy. Distinctly meaningless middle management motivational slogan tier as far as proclamations of evil go, that, but I don't mind a "we must first punch the world to bits before making it good" villain, done well. We sneak up through the plaza, followed by our companion Aza. She's also a cultist, and she keeps calling the other cultists "traitors". We approach an enemy, select our knife, and Aza says "It's killing time!". That is my third least favourite thing a companion can say, Aza.</p>
<p>We stealth stab one cultist, but their body is immediately spotted by another. No matter! We have guns, grenades, and slo-mo - a combination that makes us too pathologically impatient to wait for grenades to create an honest god-fearing explosion on their own time, and so we shoot ours mid-air. Yep, that'll do it. A bit more shooting, and we're inside.</p>
<p>We follow bloody footprints inside the building until we meet a science lady named Exemplar Foxworth. We can immediately tell she's a science lady because she starts breathlessly babbling calculations, as all good pop culture scientists are contractually obligated to do. Whoa! Slow down there, braniac! Can you say that again….<em>in English!</em> She's been left bleeding out via slapdash exsanguination, but it looks like we either don't have high enough medical skills or a kit to patch her up. Conversational skill checks, check.</p>
<p>She fills you in on the situation. The cult has been going billy bear blood sausage nutso around the facility. "Is there any science around here we use to find and kill them?", asks your companion, quirkaciously. What a delightful whackadoodle whose shtick certainly was not worn out halfway through her very first sentence. Science lady points you to a scanner to locate the invisible cultists. She calls them "visibility impaired".</p>
<p>Sorry. Sorry. Just headbutted my keyboard six times in a row then blacked out for a moment. We pass over some electrified corridors and locate the scanner in another room. It's a mask that, indeed, reveals the cultists through infra-red bug vision. We find a few cultists and whack them with the Toys R Us scythe, which looks nicely chunky. "Homicide always cheers me up!", says Aza, evidently unsatisfied with only coming third on my shit list previously.</p>
<p>We return to science lady for some more advice on opening some doors, solve a lever puzzle, then it's off to locate and kill a cultist named Victor. Before that, we take a quick jaunt to show off killable NPCs by putting an end to science lady's calculations for good. Murderable everyone, check. Murderable everyone as a crowdpleasing feature without the branching quest design that would make that feature interesting to begin with? Unconfirmed!</p>
<p>And that's curtains, or hastily shut blinds anyway. Well! I like the art direction. The melee combat looks neat. But can I bank on these enough to buy me a fresh pair of unground teeth each time a character opens their mouths? Starting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">miss Avowed already, honestly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Content Warning: This article includes references to extreme sexual violence, please read on at your own discretion. </strong></p>
<p>Valve has removed a Steam game which contained explicit sexual violence from sale in various countries, including the UK, following media attention. </p>
<p>The Steam page for No Mercy described the game as "a 3D choice-driven adult visual novel with a huge focus on incest and male domination". Gameplay footage seen by Eurogamer included non-consensual sex.</p>
<p>When No Mercy first came to our attention, Eurogamer contacted Valve for comment regarding the game's themes and graphic content, and asked why it had been allowed onto the PC storefront, but we did not hear back. Now, Valve has quietly removed No Mercy from sale in the UK and other countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle berated Valve for allowing No Mercy to be sold. "We expect every one of those [tech] companies to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it," Kyle told <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/tech/steam-violent-misogyny-video-game-no-mercy/">LBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-minister-slams-valve-for-explicit-game-promoting-non-consensual-sexual-contact-and-sexual-violence">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). "That's what the law requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do."</p>
<p>While No Mercy's Steam page did warn that the game included violent, graphic imagery and themes, Valve's storefront allows anyone to view product pages by simply inputting a date of birth via a drop-down menu, with no further checks necessary. </p>
<p>The Game Ratings Authority, which administers the PEGI system in the UK, stated "games on Steam can optionally apply for a PEGI age rating via our classification process", however this is "not mandated by the platform" ahead of a game's release on the storefront.</p>
<p>It added the Games Rating Authority had "not classified this game" prior to its release and Steam, and nor had it been requested to do so since.</p>
<p>In an additional statement shared with GamesIndustry.biz, CEO of Women in Games Dr Marie-Claire Isaaman said the organisation was "appalled by recent reports surrounding a Steam game, which encourages players to 'become every woman's worst nightmare' and 'never take no for an answer'."</p>
<p>Isaaman said the availability of games such as No Mercy on Steam was "utterly unacceptable", as it "sends a clear and distressing message: that violence against women is not only tolerable, but playable".</p>
<p>"That message has no place in our industry, our communities, or our society," Isaaman said.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry.biz has also now reported that No Mercy is unavailable for sale in Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has again reached out to Valve for comment on No Mercy, asking why it was ever allowed on Steam, and about its subsequent removal from the platform.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Stellar Crown is back in stock (finally), and Amazon also has the Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection if you're feeling like a true Tera master. Meanwhile, Lenovo quietly dropped Xbox Wireless Controllers to $39.99, and I’m just over here trying to convince myself I <em>don’t</em> need one in every color.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Stellar Crown Boxes and $25 off Xbox Series X/S Controllers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s a new Humble Bundle that looks like someone dumped every neon-drenched game into one lineup, and somehow Fallout fans are getting a $200 Pip-Boy replica that actually works as a clock.

It’s overstuffed, overpriced, over the top and exactly what I want from a premium Pokémon box.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-stella"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stella">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218495"><div id="218495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the Stellar Crown ETB is one of the best recent Pokémon releases, and not just because it includes a full-art Noctowl.

You get six booster packs from the latest set, which is hard enough to find in stores, and I appreciate not having to overpay a reseller just to get in on the new pulls. For anyone trying to keep up with the expansion, this is as straightforward as it gets.</p></div><p id="iniu-140w-power-bank"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU 140W Power Bank">INIU 140W Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218399"><div id="218399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 140W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the <strong>INIU 140W 27,000mAh Power Bank</strong> is the backup battery I actually trust when I know I’ll be away from an outlet for more than a few hours.

The digital display is genuinely useful, and having three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) makes it easy to keep everything charged without doing the cable shuffle.</p></div><p id="fallout-lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack">Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218400"><div id="218400" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually get excited about merch, but the Fallout – Lucy’s Vault 33 Backpack from the IGN Store actually feels like something I’d use.

This isn’t a cheap cosplay throw-in, it’s got a full 20L capacity, a 16-inch laptop pocket, and more compartments than I know what to do with. Plus, it comes with that massive yellow fleece blanket for the full Fallout-core vibe. I’m not planning on trekking across a wasteland anytime soon, but it’s good to know the bag is ready just in case.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-20000mah-65w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W">INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218401"><div id="218401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use on-site coupon for full discount</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU 65W 20,000mAh Power Bank is the one I reach for when I need power without the bulk.

Unfortunately for the folks who made it, the answer is pretty likely to immediately be, “Pokemon with guns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because when the game first exploded into popularity, that’s the shorthand everyone on the internet used for it, likely contributing to its rise thanks to the odd combination of two unlike ideas. Heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-snaps-up-pokmon-with-guns-game-palworld-for-game-pass-release-date-confirmed"><u>we at IGN</u></a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-insists-that-its-pokmon-with-guns-survival-game-is-not-a-scam"><u>guilty of using the phrase</u></a> too, just like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1008US1008&amp;oq=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMgYIBRBFGEAyBggGEEUYQDIGCAcQRRhA0gEINDU1NGowajSoAgCwAgDxBSg3gEcuecCb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>everyone else</u></a>. It was convenient and easy for those who had never heard of the game to immediately understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But according to Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, “Pokemon with guns” was never intended to be the takeaway. In fact, he says that Pocketpair largely doesn’t <em>love</em> the moniker. He said this in a talk at the Game Developers Conference last month, when he discussed the initial rise to fame of Palworld in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We revealed the game to the world in June of 2021, so quite a few years ago. We posted a trailer at what's called Indie Live Expo, which is an indie gaming event in Japan. We showed this off to the Japanese audience initially, we had a really, really good reception. But very quickly, Western media got eyes on this little game, and we were very quickly branded, as early as 2021, as a ‘certain franchise’ plus guns. This would be something that has stuck with us to this very day, despite our best efforts to shake that off.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After his talk, I spoke with Buckley in an interview and asked him to elaborate on this. Buckley responded that Pokemon was never really part of the pitch to begin with. Sure, the development team is largely composed of fans of the game, and they clocked the monster-collecting similarities. But the goal was always to be more like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK,” he said. “So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things about ARK, is that everything’s about the dinosaurs. Some are cute, some are cool. But we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing. And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Buckley if he thinks the “Pokemon with guns” label helped Palworld become as successful as it was, and he acknowledges it did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I mean, that was big,” he said. “That was definitely a big thing. Dave [Oshry] from New Blood [Interactive, publisher of Dusk, Fallen Aces, and others] messaged us because he trademarked the website, ‘Pokemonwithguns.com’ and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But still today, 2025, if people want to say [“Pokemon with guns”], that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit, is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Buckley also doesn’t feel that Pokemon is even a meaningful source of market competition with Palworld. “I don’t think the audiences cross over that much,” he said, again pointing to ARK as a neater parallel. Even then, though, he doesn’t feel Palworld is fighting with anyone else in particular for an audience of players. Not even Helldivers 2, which he said a “very significant” portion of Palworld players also bought on release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1881483215208329464" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gotten in trouble for ranting about the ‘console wars’ before</u></a>, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it,” he said. “Almost like a meta-marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with the timing [of releases] more than anything, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if “Pokemon with guns” is out, what tagline would Buckley have had go viral, if he could have had his way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I probably would've called it, ‘Palworld: It's Kind of Like ARK if ARK Met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends’ or something like that. That’s how I might’ve said it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I told him it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the same, to which he agrees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough"><u>Buckley and I also spoke about the</u></a> possibility of Palworld coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>, and much more in our interview.

During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve already run a number of shorter stories on some of the highlights of our conversation with Buckley, but given the depth of insight he provided on Pocketpair’s community struggles and triumphs, we decided to publish the full extended interview here as well. If you’re looking for something a bit shorter and easier to follow, you can read at these links on Buckley’s comments about the possibility of Palworld <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the studio’s reaction to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-arent-fans-of-the-pokemon-with-guns-moniker">the game being called “Pokemon with guns”</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity:
<strong>IGN: I'm going to get the really annoying one that I know you can't really answer out of the way first. You talked so, so lightly about the lawsuit in your GDC talk. Has that lawsuit made it harder for Pocketpair to move forward and update the game, having that still pending?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Buckley:</strong> No, it hasn't made it harder to update the game or to move forward. It's just kind of something that weighs over you all the time. It's something that everyone's always thinking about, but it hasn't made the game harder to update. It hasn't affected development in that regard. It's just kind of affected the company's morale more than anything else. And obviously, lawyers have to be hired and stuff like that, of course, of course, but I'm not involved in any of that, and really no one else at the company is other than the top, right? It's just morale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, real conversation time. I was fascinated at the start of your talk when you talked about, sort of cheekily, the ‘Pokemon with guns’ moniker. I was surprised that you didn't seem to like that. Can I ask why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of people don't believe us when we say this, but I think a lot of people think that was written on a whiteboard before the game development started, like, “This is the goal," but it never was. We always wanted to make something that was kind of like ARK: Survival Evolved, but with a lot more automation and with a bit more personality to each of the creatures, because a lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK. So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things that ARK, everything's done with the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs, some of them are cute, but we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said in the talk that you didn't understand why Palworld took off the way it did, you couldn't explain it. And I'm not a market analyst, so I certainly couldn't tell you, but I do feel like I specifically remember when "Pokemon with guns" came into the conversation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. No, I mean, that was big. That was definitely a big thing. I mean, Dave [Oshry] Dave from New Blood messaged us because he trademarked the website, Pokemonwithguns.com and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough. But still today, 2025, if people want to say that, that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, how would you have phrased it? What would've been your "moniker" for this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I probably would've called it, “Palworld: It's kind of like ARK if ARK met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends, or something like that. That's how I might've said it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It doesn't quite roll off the tongue the same way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, it doesn't, does it? Maybe that's why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that you brought up in the talk were the criticisms people made saying the game was AI slop. How did that impact folks internally at Pocketpair?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Massively, massively, massively, massively. That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, "I hate this company. They use AI," and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting. It's something that upsets everyone, but at different levels. It's the artists especially who really, really take it the worst, especially our Pal concept artists. We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn. I talked about that. The easy idea is to put everyone in front of a camera and have them talk about it, but none of our people want to be on camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, when you gave your talk you mentioned people not wanting to be super visible online because the internet is bad.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, they don't want to be visible. And I'm not using it as an excuse, but the vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things. But like I said in my talk, we haven't really cracked how to properly refute this yet. We released an art book, and it definitely, definitely made a big impact, but not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We are having this industry-wide conversation about generative AI and generative AI art, and people think that they're really good at spotting it, and you can't always. If something has seven weird fingers, it's probably pretty obvious, but less so in other cases, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of the arguments for ours, I think, again, I'm obviously biased towards this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ai-palworld-accusations-are-currently-based-on-vibes-a-social-deduction-game-and-the-ceos-past-tweets-about-machine-generated-fakemon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I think they're pretty hollow</a>. I mean, it all comes from comments that our CEO made in 2020, 2021-ish. There was a very famous Kotaku post. Before GenAI really became a thing, Kotaku made an article about it, and our CEO commented, "Sugoi," the Japanese word for amazing. People see the word amazing, and they think his reaction's like, "Whoa, this is incredible. I love this." And I think his intention was more just like a, "Look at this thing." I don't think he was too gung-ho on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, I think the thing that really kind of tipped it for people is in 2022, 2023, two people... So Pocketpair is what we call an open development company. So you join Pocketpair, and then you work on the game you want to work on rather than we're hiring you to specifically work on this. We check that you can do the work. You join the company. And then, you want to work on Craftopia? Cool. You want to work on Palword? Cool. You want to just do your own thing? Okay, we'll let you do that for a period of time, and if that might become something, maybe we can help you make that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Never Grave, another game we're doing, actually came from that model of people having this idea, they pursued it, and we let them do it. Two or three members of Pocketpair made a game a few years ago called AI: Art Imposter, which is a party game. [<em>Author's note: AI Imposter does involve players generating AI images in a social deduction game format where the "imposter" isn't told the theme of the generation</em>.] Well, that didn't go down the way we thought it would go down. I think we all thought it would be a funny, ironic kind of a thing. Here's a party game where you're trying to catch out the person, but it didn't matter. People take that as our declaration of "We love GenAI." It'll be quite the opposite, but again, it is what it is. Art Imposter was popular in Japan, so like a lot of our games, we're happy that somewhere enjoyed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's your overall take on the state of, not your community specifically, but online gaming communities in general? You're talking about getting all that harassment and stuff, is social media broadly useful for you all anymore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Well, social media's big for us. Funny enough, I went to a publisher roundtable yesterday, and it was very split in the middle, actually. The same question came up. Some of us think, yes, that's the way to go. Some people think it's not the way to go anymore. It's big for us. It's big for us because we are primarily an Asian market game. All of our games have been big in Japan and China and stuff, and these are places where social media is like people live and breathe it. You can't ignore it. Whereas over here, I know there's a bit more pushback. Online gaming communities, yeah, they can be very intense sometimes. I think people get very emotional sometimes and they get very swept away in those emotions, and I understand that. I mean, I used to play a lot of MMOs, a lot of PvP MMOs. That used to be my big thing before I got a real job. The communities, but I understand that people get swept away in things and you kind of lash out, and I get that. And there's a lot of people that lash out at us that I just kind of take on the chin. I'm like, "That's fine."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's all this death-threat stuff. It's when it reaches that point where you're like, "How could you be this upset?" It's never that serious. And it's usually very illogical death threats. Maybe we release a patch that breaks something, and, "I'm going to kill you and put a knife in your neck." And I always just want to say, "Do you think we're not going to fix it? I mean, we'll obviously fix this, right? We didn't do this on purpose. We're not breaking your game on purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think the big thing that a lot of people don't sympathize with is you might play a game, you might play our game for three hours in a row, and then you experience a critical bug, and it crashes. That's a super frustrating experience. I 100% agree, I sympathize, I get it. But then you disconnect from it, and you go and do something else. We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen. So, I wish people would be a bit more sympathetic to these things, that we don't like it as much as they like it, and we're trying to fix these things. So, a bit of heat is fine. Spur of the moment insults is fine. I get it. We're all people, but it's the death threats that really get to us the most because it's so dumb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you feel like social media is trending worse lately?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think, especially these days, there's a lot more people on social media who just say the opposite thing because they know they'll get the reaction now. And it's trending a bit and there's a few big accounts that have become quite notorious for always seeming to be on the opposite side. A new game comes out and everyone's like, "This is great." There's always that crowd now that go, "Nope, this is not. It's bad," for all these reasons that have nothing to do with the game, basically, always. And I think that, I don't know, maybe social media is encouraging that recently. It gets the clicks, it gets the trends. Yeah, luckily, we don't get much of that. Palworld, weirdly enough, kind of has avoided a lot of these, I don't know, I don't know what you say, political and social stuff. We just get a lot of "The game's broken" kind of requests. That's what we get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I thought it was really interesting in your talk that you said that the majority of the heat came from the Western audience. I guess I just assumed it would be equal across the board. Do you have any insight as to why that was?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, no, no. We've tried to figure this out too. We are quite a divisive company in Japan. It's a 50/50 in Japan of whether people love us or whether people really hate us. I don't know. I think not a lot of game companies in Japan make games for the overseas market. They make a game for home, and then it blows up overseas, whereas we always try to strike overseas first with the kind of Japanese flair to it. And we call ourselves indie a lot, which a lot of Japanese gamers don't like, unfortunately. Even though we firmly believe we're indie, but yeah, that's always contested back home. I don't know why we get a lot of heat overseas. Maybe it was just easy pickings at that time. It's simmered down a lot. It's very manageable now. But a lot of that, especially the death threats and stuff, were very much in English. We didn't get a lot of that in Japan or China.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Palworld was extremely successful, and I get the sense, perhaps in a way that was maybe unexpected for you all based on your talk. Has that changed anything about how the studio runs or what your future plans are or anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: It's changed our future plans, yes. It has not changed the studio. For better or worse, we remain basically unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said the community team did not get bigger in response. Did the studio get bigger in other ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. I mean, our server team has grown. We're hiring more developers all the time. We're hiring more artists all the time. One of our sore points as a company is just making things quicker for the fans. So we're always trying to onboard as many developers as we can to kind of speed up development time. But the company culture hasn't changed that much. It's obviously bigger now, but we haven't reached that kind of tipping point yet. And our CEO really wants to avoid that because he's a very homebody kind of guy, so he wants to keep it small. I say small, it's 70 people now. That's a lot of people. He doesn't want to get into the hundreds, he says, anyway. But no, I mean, this level of success was unexpected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You knew it was a good game, but you didn't know that it was going to be </strong><em><strong>this </strong></em><strong>big.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, a million sales for anyone, I think you've made it. Well, sorry. I said anyone. I mean a million sales for an indie game. You've made it. Congratulations. You're a platinum standard. Two million? Unbelievable. You should be screaming that from the roof. When you get into the 10 millions is when it just gets very surreal, and you don't really know what's happening anymore. And Steam is sending you, "Here's your monthly sales reports, and here's your monthly impression reports," and it's just numbers that don't make sense. And then you get a bit, not reckless, but you get a bit free with how you spend it and nothing happens. Yeah, it all gets very weird and surreal, and it's still hard for us to kind of get a grasp on it, basically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you anticipate that Palworld is something that Pocketpair is going to support for a really, really long time to come?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea, but it's definitely going to be something that we're always sticking on. But we do want to kind of go back to making other stuff, too. We're still working on Craftopia. Even though everyone says we're not, we are still working on Craftopia. And there's people at the company who want to do their own thing as well, so we're trying to find ways to support all of that while also maintaining this machine that is Palworld. Because Palworld's kind of split into two things now, Palworld the game and Palworld the IP, and they're both kind of going on different trajectories right now.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. You talked about that partnership that everybody misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley:</strong> Yeah. No one understands. Someone, literally yesterday, said to me, "Why aren't you wearing a Sony jacket?" And I said, "Because we're not owned by Sony at all." No, that'll be forever misunderstood, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you think you guys ever would get acquired?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley: </strong>No. Our CEO would never allow it. He'd never allow it. He'd never allow it. He would never, never allow it. He likes doing his own thing and he likes being his own boss. He doesn't like people telling him what to do. So I would be shocked. Maybe when he's old, and he might just sell it off for money. And that would be sad, but in my lifetime, I probably won't see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, it'll be interesting to see where the two paths go. We, Pocketpair, are obviously only involved in where the game path is going. Palworld as an IP, we've given, not given, but we are involved, but very much in the hands of Aniplex and Sony Music who are steering that ship right now. We are just kind of offering our advice and thoughts as they take that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know we talked earlier about the Palworld comparisons to a Pokemon, and that you actually feel it's more like ARK. ARK is not actively releasing brand new games every one to two years and has an anime and merch like the way Pokemon does, but Pokemon is gearing up. They've got a release this year. They're constantly doing stuff. Do you see that being competitive in any way or meaningfully impacting you all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't think the audiences cross over that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Really?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: And the systems are totally different. I mean, the systems are completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sure, but you all released after Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which people including me were very critical of, and I remember seeing a lot of fans going, “Why can’t they just do what Pocketpair did?”</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't know. I think a lot of that's just people trying to stir the pot online. I see some of those comments all the time and I always think, "Come on, guys. Don't be silly now." I think they're just stirring the pot. I mean, we don't consider that as any kind of competition, or we don't want to be involved in that kind of dispute, basically. Ironically, we released alongside two other survival games, and we were more focused on them than we were anyone else, Nightingale and Enshrouded. And we very playfully back and forthed it together, because we are very similar games more than anything else. ARK. I mean, we don't see ARK as a competitor. We love the ARK guys. [Studio] Wildcard are sweethearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know. Competition in games is, I've gotten in trouble for ranting about the "console wars" before, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it. Almost like a meta marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with kind of the timing more than anything, I think. I mean, we pull a lot of telemetry and we work with a lot of data companies for these things. I don't know. The one that surprised me the most was a very significant portion of Palworld players bought Helldivers 2 on release. And that was a crossover that I was very surprised about…I think it's the co-op element, the kind of goofy element, having fun with your friends. I think Steam is really good at driving those big game releases as well. So, it's a perfect storm, really.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever release on the Switch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld's a beefy game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Switch 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buckley: Well, we haven't seen those specs yet, so we're like everyone else, we're waiting. I mean, I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them. If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we were very happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>My big takeaway from your talk is that outside of the existing Palworld community of people who have played and enjoyed the game, you feel that Palworld is extremely misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is your singular takeaway message for people who have not played it and you think misunderstand it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think a lot of people who only know of Palworld from the news and the drama and stuff, in just my opinion, probably completely misunderstand what the game even is. So I would say play it. I mean, I think we should do a demo at some point. Something that I campaign for a lot internally. At some point we should release a demo or some kind of free hour or something if we could figure it out to do it properly. But I think a lot of people who have never played it and only know it from the drama would be surprised if they played it for one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't think it's anything like what they imagine it is. We are nowhere near as seedy and scummy as people seem to think we are. I think it's the double-edged sword. We hid from the public to protect our developers, and at the same time, I think that made us look a bit inaccessible, which makes you look bad inherently. If we'd have been more public, maybe we wouldn't have got that reputation. It's two edges to that, but we have to protect our team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That’s also just the way the internet works. Whatever other things there are to do in Palworld, what’s funny is a meme video of what is effectively distilled down to Pokemon with guns. So that's what everyone's sharing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, I think we're a very nice little company. We've done very well for ourselves with every game we've ever made, and we'll continue, hopefully, to always do well. I think last year was just such a crazy year for games. I think people don't appreciate how crazy last year was. I think people will write about 2024 five years from now. There were just so many unbelievably successful games last year. [Black Myth:] Wukong, Helldivers [2], Palworld, games that just hit numbers that are not normal. So I think emotions were high last year and people got swept away in the fun, maybe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</u></a>. Now, Shawn Layden, who used to run PlayStation in the U.S., has offered his thoughts, pointing to the fear of missing out on Nintendo exclusives as justifying price hikes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/pSu0BQFTFPA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayerDriven YouTube channel and podcast</a>, Layden highlighted the contrasting strategies of Sony and Microsoft, and Nintendo, where Sony and Microsoft are downplaying exclusive games as they move to PC and rival consoles, but Nintendo is keeping its games on its own consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But right here you see, ‘wow, that’s kind of a hefty price hike from Switch 1 to Switch 2 and, wow, 80 bucks for a game?’ " Layden said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if it’s the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 pricing in the U.S.:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden also talked about the price of video games generally, which, he insisted, have actually gone down over the years when you take into account inflation. Layden said console manufacturers should have hiked the price of games by $5 with each new console generation so that they would cost around $90 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was in it at the time — probably every generation they should have baked in a $5 software price hike, and make that the typical, 'well every generation it's another five bucks.' And you would have been up to $90 already by now."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, Trinen insisted Mario Kart World justifies its $80 price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this"><u>some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</u></a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Log into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> at any point over the next week, and you'll unlock a free in-game loading screen showing the game's stock market crashing. 
</p>
<p>
The well-timed stunt comes as economies around the world react to the ever-changing impact of US tarrifs in real time - though the giveaway is primarily designed to highlight the current storyline in Epic Games' battle royale.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's giveaway of The Big Dillbits Crash loading screen is live now, and lasts until next Tuesday, 15th April. Maybe everything will be fine by then.
</p>
<p>
The image shows Fletcher Kane, the villain of Fortnite's current season, reacting in shock as his BitCoin-esque virtual currency suddenly collapses, ruining his financial hold over the Fortnite Island. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/a29d9e01-c7f3-4b0d-8406-cfcb59020faa.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
Fortnite had raised some fan eyebrows by introducing the concept of a planet-burning virtual currency, DillBits, to its storyline. In-game, players can obtain DillBits by robbing vaults, and spend them in nearby Black Market stores for exotic weaponary. 
</p>
<p>
At first, DillBits were presented as the source of enormous wealth, and were being championed by fan-favourite character Midas - someone able to create unlimited gold simply by touching something with his bare hands. Why would he need more money, though, players wondered?
</p>
<p>
Now, it turns out that DillBits was a deliberate hustle by Midas and company, designed to ruin Fletcher Kane and end his reign over the Island by suckering him into a BitCoin-like scam. Nice.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite seasons are planned months in advance, and Epic Games likely had this loading screen ready to  launch for some time. But the decision to release it to all players now, specifically, feels like a knowing nod about real-world events as well.
</p>
<p>
Back in the real world, the impact of US tarrifs on the global economy is still being felt, particularly by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">Nintendo fans in both the US and Canada</a> who are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">still waiting for news on when they will be able to pre-order a Switch 2</a> - and how much Nintendo will now charge.

The years pass and the animals perish and the oceans rise and the wealth gap widens and I repeatedly think to myself through a fug of nitrogen oxide, Steam discounts and microplastic sediment, “man, those Oddworld games were excellent, weren’t they”. If you've yet to have the pleasure, you can scoop up the entirety of the squalid anti-capitalist satire universe on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXjw3">Fanatical</a> right now for a pound or dollar.

Released in 1997 for Personable Computers and the PlayableStation, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-oddysee">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a> is the story of a Mudokon meat factory worker with his mouth sewn shut who overhears plans to convert the entire workforce into popsicles. It’s a single-screen 2D platformer in which your skills consist of jumping, pulling levers, communicating by means of a once-touted GameSpeak system, farting, and praying.</p>

<p>Oh, how you’ll pray, for you have all the offensive capacity and resilience of a McDonalds salad. Threats include gun-toting Sligs and their miniature T-Rex guard dogs, handsy herds of Paramites, and the viciously territorial Scrabs. The nearest you get to fighting back is possessing the bodies of other creatures and making use of their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Survival rests on manipulating the puzzle-game workings of each screen so as to bypass or isolate dangers, often by the skin of your teeth.  Death is frequent, and gruesomely funny. Abe might be gaming’s ultimate fallguy. Also funny: watching a crowd of Mudokons squeakily tip-toe past a sleeping sentry. Aside from getting the hell out of Rupture Farms, the game calls on you to play a mixture of local messiah and union organiser – commanding and guiding your fellow labourers to mystic portals formed by flocks of birds, while trying not to get them mulched, eaten, blown up, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-abes-exoddus">Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus</a> is in some ways a remake, fleshing out the Mudokon communication aspect and turning in a grander plot involving a ghastly new mind-altering soft drink. Mudokons now have emotional states - they'll get angry, wired, depressed or sick, which means you now have to worry about your allies running around giggling or getting into possibly-fatal slapfights. I think Exoddus is the better game than Oddysee, the one they really wanted to make, but they’re both excellent, with tumid, desolate industrial environments made up of pipes and chasms and LED displays.</p>
<p>The later Oddworld games are more of a mixture. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is the standout, a cult Wild Western shooter in which your bullets are squirming critters. Oddworld: Munch's Oddyssey is an imperfect departure into full 3D platforming. I never got round to playing the 2.5D series reboot <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddworld-soulstorm">Oddworld: Soulstorm</a>, but I hear it's a bit ropey.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I need a new Oddworld game right now, but I’d like to play more games that recall this particular blend of gallows humour, apocalyptic gloom and ingenuity. If you’d like to recommend an Oddworld spiritual successor, I’m all ears.

<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-news-on-kingdom-hearts-4-release-date">No News on Kingdom Hearts 4 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The epicness. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

<p>However, further confusion specifically arose around Switch 2 Edition games and whether the card would include both the original game and the upgrade package.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said: "Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (ie. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code)."</p>
<p>They added: "Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card."</p>
<p>This confirms the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will be complete on the game card. Third-party publishers may still opt for download codes, though.</p>
<p>These Switch 2 Edition games upgrade the originals with new features to make use of the new console's capabilities, be it improved frame rates or camera usage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">They will cost £65 here in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">Kirby and the Forgotten Land will include expanded worlds</a>, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have mouse control support.</p>
<p>No matter what's on the game card, though, don't lick them - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo has confirmed the cards still purposefully taste awful</a> to stop players eating them.</p>

<p>Upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games have been confusing because of their contents, but Nintendo has clarified that they don’t include download codes, and everything is on the game cartridge.</p>



<p>The physical and digital media conversation is louder than ever. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2’s increased game costs</a> have made physical media the costliest it’s ever been. But when players are paying for physical media and receiving digital media instead, it sends mixed signals.</p>



<p>There’s been unrest and understandable headscratching over the Switch 2’s games and what you get. There’s been talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 physical Nintendo Switch 2 games</a> giving you a code instead of a game cartridge. One thing we know for sure is that if you buy a Switch 2 Edition release, you don’t get a code.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-edition-games-have-everything-on-the-game-cartridge">Switch 2 Edition Games Have Everything on The Game Cartridge</h2>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, Nintendo addressed Switch 2 game cartridge concerns: “That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will <strong>include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card</strong> (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code).”</p>



<p>So, if you’re buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild</a> Switch 2 Edition, you get the game’s box and a cartridge inside with the full upgraded version of the RPG—<strong>no code required or included</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo did clarify that this applies to first-party exclusives: “Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.” We’ve seen this before with Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Rogue bundle featuring a physical case and a download-only code inside it.</p>

            <p>It's hard to imagine, but Mario Kart: Double Dash's two-player driving mechanic <em>almost </em>didn't happen!</p>
<p>As I am sure you know, in Mario Kart: Double Dash, rather than only choosing one character to plop into a kart of your choosing, players instead select two characters to ride in a kart together, with one at the back and one at the front.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo was anxious about introducing this mechanic into the Mario Kart series, so also worked on a "single-driver version" in tandem with the doubled-up driver version we all know today.</p>

<p>That's according to a 2003 interview with Mario Kart: Double Dash's developers, which first featured in Nintendo Dream magazine but has been freshly translated by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/doubledash/">Shmuplations</a>. Within this interview, producer Shinya Takahashi explained that "since Mario Kart has always been more of a party game", the team's "point-of-departure for the development was thinking about what new multiplayer gameplay mechanics we could add, and specifically what new mechanics we could add if the karts had two drivers".</p>
<p>However, the Double Dash team wanted to ensure it was innovating the series, "while not destroying what makes Mario Kart unique". The producer added this was "a monumental challenge" for those working on the game. Fellow producer Tadashi Sugiyama added Mario Kart had already turned into a "flagship title for Nintendo", and "each console has to have its own Mario Kart" title.</p>
<p>"Well, of course it's going to sell big, it's Mario Kart! - that pressure is huge," Sugiyama said, noting creating a game like this comes with "all these expectations" and the team had to "add something new" to the formula.</p>
<p>"The 'two drivers' concept, therefore, was something we came to at the end of a veryyy long process of brainstorming. We were a little worried about it though, so at first we were developing a single-driver version too, in parallel with the two-driver development," Sugiyama revealed, with Takahashi joking this was the Double Dash team's "emergency escape hatch" should all else fail.</p>
<p>"But in the end, owing I think to the majority of our staff who really wanted to do something new, we consolidated the development into just the two-driver concept," Sugiyama said</p>
<p>That isn't to say it wasn't still challenging to implement, and according to chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki, the best part of a year was spent working out that two-driver mechanic.  "We tried all sorts of stuff," Mizuki said.</p>
<p>One idea floated around for a while was to include sidecars, which immediately made me picture a Wallace and Gromit/Two Fat Ladies racer, which is perhaps making me show my age. Anyway, back to the interview in hand!</p>
<p>"Normally when one thinks of two people in a car, you think of a driver and passenger seat side-by-side. But for Mario Kart, that would end up making the karts too wide. Can you imagine eight massive karts lined up like that," Sugiyama quipped.</p>
<p>Takahashi added the developers "messed around with the positioning a lot", and eventually settled on "having them ride behind you" but this led to another issue - not being able to see both drivers. The solution? "To let you swap the drivers at any time," Sugiyama closed, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>The Mario Kart reign remains strong, and the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will also hail in the latest series entry: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Unlike Mario Kart games of old, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">World will include the ability to drive basically anywhere and a whopping 24 drivers can compete in a race</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>One of the clearest benefits of the modern world is the ability to dig into your interests and hobbies in a way that would never have been possible before. That said, game development remains something of a secret society, hushed tones and controlled PR encounters sometimes making it seem as though games blossom into being, ready to play. Common sense says that’s not the case, and 10 Chambers are providing us with the opportunity to see what game development is truly like, with ‘Do The Game’ charting the Stockholm-based studio’s path through their latest game’s development.</p>
<p><iframe title="DO THE GAME | Game Dev Docu-Reality TV Series | Official Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7tVu_YEEGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That game is Den of Wolves, the spiritual successor to their earlier work on GTFO, Payday 1 and Payday 2. We were lucky enough to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/">hands-on with it a couple of weeks ago</a>, and it already looks like it could be a big multiplayer hit for the team when it launches sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>10 Chambers, founded by Ulf Anderson, Oscar J-T Holm, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, are a team built on pragmatism, and a family feud that saw Ulf and his brother go their separate ways. That reality, that emotional grounding, sets the groundwork for Do The Game, and the team wanted the documentary to show the gritty reality of game development, through turmoil, struggles and successes rather than sugarcoat that process as many pre-release showcases would.</p>


<p>“With our previous success of GTFO and now working on a major title like Den of Wolves, it might seem glamorous,” says Oscar J-T Holm, Co-Founder at 10 Chambers. “However, growing a company while building a game can be incredibly stressful and create tension even between long-time friends. Through this Docu-Reality series, we aim to provide a brutally honest look behind the scenes of all this.”</p>
<p>With Do The Game, 10 Chambers is inviting the world to witness the untold reality of game development—the chaos, passion, and pressure of trying to make history. Ulf Anderson’s contribution? “I hate making this documentary”, he says.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Do The Game, and Den of Wolves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> has received a new trailer for the Horde Assault mode ahead of the game's launch set for April 25. Kevin McAllister, Creative &amp; Product Lead at developer Bend Studio, also shared new information on Horde Assault in a dedicated <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/days-gone-remastered-a-closer-look-at-the-horde-assault-modes-survival-arcade-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The 'survival arcade' mode was designed to challenge the players' skills as they attempt to beat their high score while surviving as long as possible against increasing horde sizes and various enemies such as Breakers, Reachers, and Raging Bears. In Horde Assault, players start with only a sidearm and must fight their way through the initial Freaker onslaught to reach Deacon St. John's Drifter Bike, an invaluable tool for traversing the open region.</p>
<p>Raiding the supply crates scattered across the map is crucial to increasing your chances of survival. There are more than 20 weapons available, including a new flamethrower not available in Story mode. The weapons that drop from each crate are random and reset each time you start a new game.</p>
<p>You may also replenish your supplies and earn extra XP by completing side quests. Also, if you manage to survive 30 minutes on any map, you will be treated to the Ultimate Horde, a never-ending horde battle that will relentlessly hunt you down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Days Gone Remastered - Horde Assault Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BJ5L-TIK1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As players level up Deacon St. John, they can earn in-mode rewards with never-before-playable characters, new patch cosmetics, and unique Injectors. Speaking of those, Days Gone players will already be familiar with the benefits of Injectors from the main story. This idea carries over to Horde Assault, but now with a big boost to drastically change gameplay in the form of modifiers. Throughout your journey to Legendary Survivor, you can earn a total of 24 unique Injectors - 12 positive and 12 negative. Positive Injectors provide a positive boost to your score but increase the challenge. Negative Injectors will penalize your score but increase your chance of survival with gameplay benefits.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploding Freakers – Upon death, Freakers will explode. You need any advantage you can get when facing increased horde sizes, and this Injector is a unique way to trim its numbers.</li>
<li>Wanted – Start at maximum heat level. In Horde Assault, the longer you survive, the more difficult your chances of survival become. With this Injector, that escalation difficulty system begins immediately, proving to be a real challenge that only the strongest will survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Days Gone Remastered, as players go through Horde Assault mode, they'll progress through a Reward path of 35 levels. Each level earns them a reward, such as Injectors, character skins, and patch cosmetics, and six never-before-playable additional characters from Days Gone: O’Brian, Lisa, fan-favorite Skizzo, and more.</p>
<p>On PlayStation 5, this new edition of the game also comes with graphical enhancements, full DualSense support, new accessibility features and enhanced Photo Mode. PlayStation 4 and PC owners of the base game can purchase the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3238470/Days_Gone__Broken_Road_DLC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Road DLC</a> for $10, accessing Horde Assault as well as Permadeath mode and Speedrun mode.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/days-gone-drifting-through-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loved</a> Days Gone at launch. Unfortunately, a pitch for a sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected</a>. In theory, a movie should be in production, although there haven't been any official updates on that front <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-film-adaptation-on-the-way-game-creators-arent-happy-with-cast-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since August 2022</a>. Meanwhile, Bend Studio had its next project, an open world multiplayer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> a couple of months ago.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a lawsuit over the shutdown of its racing game The Crew, stating players purchased a "limited license to access the game" as opposed to "unfettered ownership".</p>
<p>The game was taken offline in March last year, becoming unplayable due to its online requirements. Despite being 10 years old and essentially replaced by a successor, the decision sparked concern over both consumer rights and game preservation.</p>
<p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sued-over-controversial-the-crew-shutdown">fans filed a lawsuit in California against Ubisoft</a>, stating players were unaware they owned only a licence to the game. Ubisoft responded in February, in a filing seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The filing, from Ubisoft's lawyers, states the company "allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game".</p>
<p>"But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license," it reads.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's lawyers claim plaintiffs have applied a "kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers" and alleged eight causes of action including false advertising and unfair competition. In response, they believe there has been no real "cognisable injury".</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then responded in March with an amended complaint and an additional accusation around gift certificates. Sales of the game's currency, they argued, could be considered a gift certificate and in California, gift certificates can't expire - yet with the game shut down, the in-game currency has expired.</p>
<p>Further, photos of the packaging from the plaintiffs reveal the activation code for the game doesn't expire until 2099, which they claim is how Ubisoft "implied that [The Crew] would remain playable during this time and long thereafter". As such, they believe the statute of limitations has not expired.</p>
<p>Ubisoft now has until 29th April to respond once again.</p>
<p>After shutting down the game's servers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft retroactively added offline modes to other games in the series</a>.</p>
<p>One group of modders, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">recreated the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a securities analyst that Nintendo could be shaping up to sell every Switch 2 console ‘at a loss’ based on the estimated costs of the bill of materials. This is because of the recent tariffs imposed by the United States government, and it’s assuming that they stay at 10%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uneven-ground">Uneven Ground</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, the scope of the financial situation surrounding Nintendo and Trump’s tariffs came into question.</p>



<p>Hideki Yasuda of Toyo Securities in Japan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe the Switch 2’s bill of materials is around $400, meaning Nintendo would still be selling consoles at a loss in the US with the 10% tariff — but the loss would be something Nintendo would be able to absorb.</p>



<p>Sony is in a tougher situation as most of its PlayStation production is in China, and it may be forced to hike PS5 prices in the US in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s price point is much higher than that of the first console, released in 2017, but Nintendo recently went on record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/">explaining why that is</a>. It’s all to do with the quality of the offering and the upgrades over the first console – and inflation also weighs into the debate.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Bernstein’s Robin Zhu explained how Nintendo could raise prices if the tariffs escalate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo probably keeps pricing at $450 and just takes the hit on margin.</p>



<p>At 46% Vietnam tariffs, I expected them to raise by $50 to $100.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These tariffs are wreaking havoc on the pre-order situation in the United States and Canada. Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been put on hold as manufacturers and retailers across the region contend with what might happen next.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight is a special game, for any number of reasons. Arresting art direction, a strong black female lead, a South American folklore-inspired tale, it also stands amongst the quite suddenly reinvigorated first-party line-up from Microsoft and Xbox. Here it’s the turn of Compulsion Games to weave a fantastical and mesmerizing adventure, joining Avowed and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle at the newfound pinnacle of Xbox gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEZg6TYJTl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our central character is Hazel, a track star who lives with her mama in Prospero, a fictional town in the American South. They’re surrounded by nature, their house sitting on concrete stilts next to a river, but when a downpour causes the river to swell, the house is swept away with Hazel’s mama inside, forcing Hazel to set off on a magical journey of self-discovery.</p>


<p>It turns out that track star Hazel is a Weaver. These mystical female icons have previously served as leaders and protectors, drawing on the powers of weaving to restore the natural order and release spirits back to where they belong. Through South of Midnight’s 12-hour runtime, you’ll unravel various mysteries centred around Hazel’s family, as well as the personal tales of the people living in the area.</p>
<p>Hazel is led through the discovery of her powers via visions of the past, watching Mahalia, the last Weaver of Prospero, lead former slaves out of bondage. Their ghostly forms, a husband, wife and small boy, are being hunted, and their fear is palpable.</p>

<p>It’s one of the best narrative framings for a tutorial I’ve come across, adding tension and emotion, despite it being a reenactment of the past. When other games make these sections frictionless and rote, Compulsion make it clear that storytelling is at the heart of South of Midnight, and that they’ll make use of every possible moment they have with a player.</p>

<p>As Hazel’s skills grow, you learn and understand more about the people of this fictional bayou, and their pain. South of Midnight wants you to empathise, to understand, and to inhabit the culturally and emotionally disparate group of characters, and it does a fantastic job of making every moment feel personal.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is a modern fairytale. There are magical trappings, a journey of self-discovery, and the knowing sting of multiple tails waiting to surprise you. Hazel is strong, opinionated and believable, and you want to take this journey through folklore and history with her.</p>
<p>That’s helped by South of Midnight’s striking visual style, mixing stop-motion techniques with traditional digital animation. It looks phenomenal, and my only wish is that they leaned even harder into the off-kilter hand-made look. At times, it feels too smooth during the moment-to-moment gameplay, but I imagine they settled on this for easier locomotion, and probably not giving players too much to deal with visually.</p>
<p>The creature design, in particular, is stunning, giving life and character to some truly incredible monsters. Early on, you’ll love meeting the Creole Catfish, his low frame rate animation and Southern drawl setting the tone for the rest of your journey. It’s not all about the scene-stealing giant creations though, and the little stop-motion turtles, foxes and possums that populate the world also help to make it feel as though you’re playing through an animated movie.</p>

<p>South of Midnight isn’t shy about flinging powers and abilities at you, and your toolkit of ways to deal with knotted strands, giant briars and malevolent creatures soon fills up. Mechanically, South of Midnight isn’t quite as ground-breaking as its visuals and storytelling might have you expect, but this is a solid and enjoyable third-person adventure, with Hazel leaping, gliding and fighting her way through a series of visually arresting areas.</p>
<p>If anything, the combat here reminds me of Hellblade, in that there’s a limited number of enemies, and they often just serve as gates to the next area you’re going to explore. Still, I found it enjoyable perfectly timing dodges and flinging enemies around the small combat arenas, but it’s solid, rather than spectacular. There’s more than enough challenge to it to keep you on the edge of your seat, and it limits the unfair moments where you might feel that you were beaten by the camera rather than your skill set.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Hazel borrows from Lara Croft’s toolkit, ably climbing across painted sections of wood, or a handily aligned row of fungi growing from a tree. She can glide like Link, or wall run like the Prince of Persia, but there are few moments where your interaction with Hazel feels wholly new.</p>
<p>You’re here for the lore, the visuals and the storytelling. The audio is also fantastic, with energetic, emotional voice acting – all delivered with some wonderfully authentic-sounding Southern accents – and music that lilts between dark, unsettling tones before turning to hopeful acoustic moments and surprising vocal interludes. I loved it, and you should absolutely check out Olivier Deriviere’s full soundtrack as soon as you can, though it might give a few things away narratively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-from-nintendo-wont-require-any-download/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When buying Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games at retail, customers won't need any further downloads, at least if the games have been published by Nintendo. The same may not necessarily be true for third-party publishers, though. The lingering question was finally answered by a company spokesperson in a statement <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Vooks.net</a>:</p>
<p><em>The physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e., they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</em></p>
<p>So far, the following games will allow customers to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (currently unknown price)</li>
<li>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 + Star-Crossed World ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma (third-party; $69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A (currently unknown price)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as many had assumed, Nintendo also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will not include that game's Expansion Pass. Following the launch, Nintendo released two DLCs: The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. It is presently unclear, although likely, if players will be able to purchase them separately on the new console.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of fantastic sights and sounds to take in on Hazel's journey to the small town of Prospero. But there's also plenty to read as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> shines brightest with its storytelling, and that includes all the little notes you can find along your journey. Each of them adds a bit of context to the events you're experiencing and learning about.</p>
<p>They can also add a welcomed dose of historical context at times, digging into some of the tragedies that people in this fictional town faced that pull from real-life horrors. That's why it's well worth your time to seek out all 103 notes you can read in South of Midnight.</p>
<p>Starting with Chapter 1, we'll take you through where to find every single note.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 1</h2>
<p>There are only 3 notes to find in the first chapter of the game, and they're all in Bunny's house. So don't worry about looking around for anything until Hazel wakes up in Bunny's house after the night of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's note to Lily on tea</strong> - You can find this note in the room where Hazel wakes up. Look to your right, where you'll see a desk and a mirror. On that desk is the first note and the first layer of Bunny's character beginning to unravel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Notes-Guides-Chapter-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1982&nbsp;</strong>- This note and the next are both in the same room, Bunny's office. You'll climb into this room by climbing the ledges around the house, and you'll find this note on the desk to your left when you enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1989 &amp; 2003</strong> - You'll find these two journal entries as one note on the red chair, immediately in front of you when you enter Bunny's office.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>And that's all the notes for Chapter 1 in South of Midnight. Only 100 more to go!</p>

<p>Star Citizen, from Cloud Imperium, is one of the most bizarre projects you’ll ever lay your eyes on. In 2012, Cloud Imperium kickstarted a crowdfunded project to bring Star Citizen to life, and within a couple of months, millions of dollars had been raised to support the development of this space-faring epic.</p>



<p>Today, the game still hasn’t been ‘released,’ and it still sits in alpha. Recently, the team at Cloud Imperium passed the <strong>$800 million mark </strong>on the crowdfunding (and sales) scale, moving ever closer to the almighty and ludicrous $1 billion mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-burning-money">Burning Money</h2>



<p>In October 2024, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a monumental exclusive report</a> from within Cloud Imperium, diving deep into the company’s culture and the decade-long development cycle of Star Citizen.</p>



<p>It came off the back of a new working mandate that forced employees to grind their asses off to hit deadlines for a time. The report delved into financial updates that suggested the hundreds of millions of dollars the company had raised had been poured into developing the title and that the financial outlook for the firm was ‘bleak’ at best.</p>



<p>Then came the layoffs.</p>



<p>We heard from those inside CIG that the creative processes internal to the company weren’t working and that even the minutest of details were taking <strong>days </strong>to be decided on because of poor creative control and micromanagement.</p>



<p>In January, CIG’s founder, Chris Roberts, stated that the team is ‘closer than ever’ to hitting that 1.0 release mark, but there are still no timelines or indicators to suggest when that will happen. Until then, players will keep pouring in their pledges, donations, subscriptions, and purchases, some of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-legatus-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can sell for as much as $48,000</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible to track the trajectory of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Citizen’s financials</a> through the official site, where it’s revealed that, at the time of writing, $802,335,704 has been raised or earned by the project.</p>



<p>Have you ever invested any cash in Star Citizen, and are you jonesing for the 1.0 release to hit? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the first battle pass in the Tarkov universe – Season 0. It’s available exclusively in Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the multiplayer, session-based spin-off that was released in December 2023. It’s a solid staging ground to gauge the responses of players before something similar could be introduced for the core extraction shooter, though.</p>



<p>The Season 0 Battle Pass has more than 100 unique rewards, ranging from custom tactical clothing to masks and from GP coins to supply crates for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-free">Is the Tarkov Arena Battle Pass Free?</h2>



<p>That’s the question on the minds of Tarkov players worldwide, and <strong>yes</strong>, the Season 0 Battle Pass is completely free to access and grind.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that the 100+ tier battle pass will be progressable entirely through Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but there will be rewards that apply to both that game and the foundational extraction shooter title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - 0.3.0 BattlePass Season 0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQAYSNYVAvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As soon as you start your path with the Season 0 Battle Pass, you’ll unlock exclusive tactical outfits available in <strong>both </strong>Escape from Tarkov: Arena <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov, and even PvE players can take advantage of the new loot.</p>



<p>BSG <a href="https://arena.tarkov.com/news/patch-0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has advised</a> that not <strong>everything </strong>will be available in PvE, as the synchronisation mechanics between EFT: Arena and PvE mode aren’t yet complete – Ref doesn’t exist in that vertical, for instance.</p>



<p>Players will have two months to grind through the Season 0 Battle Pass, but it has been suggested that the timeline might be extended, depending on feedback.</p>



<p>Also, everything you unlock in the battle pass, including ‘Battle Pass Currency’, will be persistent through Tarkov and Tarkov Arena’s regular wipes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to grinding the Season 0 Battle Pass? Let me know in the comments.</p>

That’s significantly cheaper than other Switch 2 games, but IGN has already reported to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-would-you-make-people-pay-for-that-nintendos-decision-to-charge-for-switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-sparks-backlash"><u>the complaints from some Nintendo fans that Welcome Tour costs money at all</u></a>, with many saying it should be a Switch 2 pack-in, as DualSense tech demo game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Astro's Playroom</u></a> was for PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Fils-Aimé has tweeted three clips from IGN’s two-year-old interview with the former Nintendo executive in which he discussed the internal battle he had with legendary developer Shigeru Miyamoto to get Wii Sports as a free pack-in for the hugely successful Wii console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first clip, Fils-Aimé says "it is an understatement to say that Mr. Miyamoto pushed back” on the call to make Wii Sports a Wii console pack-in. As we know, this is a battle Fils-Aimé won to a degree, with Wii Sports bundled with the Wii everywhere except Japan.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The story of Wii Sports pack in ...<a href="https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The second interview clip Fils-Aimé tweeted pointed to a similar battle to bundle Wii Play with the Wii Remote. In the clip from our interview, Fils-Aimé revealed he “pissed off” Miyamoto once again with the suggestion. “He was not happy about that either.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, tweeting “and the results,” Fils-Aimé clipped out the section from our interview in which he reveals that all this was, ultimately, the right call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the Americas and in Europe Wii Sports was packed in with the Wii proposition. It was not in Japan, which created a bit of a test market. It was obvious that in the markets where Wii Sports was packed in that we became much more of a phenomenon. Wii Sports itself became much more of a phenomenon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We did pack the Remote with Wii Play. And it became the fifth best-selling piece of software in the history of the Wii.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">And the results.<a href="https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052943690150239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear to see what Fils-Aimé is doing here. Although he’s not directly commenting on Nintendo’s Switch 2 strategy, he is making the point that free pack-ins have worked in the past for Nintendo consoles,so it stands to reason that it would do so again for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans know what’s up, too. “Hahaha, guys I think Reggie is watching our comments about the Switch 2,” said one X / Twitter user. “We know you would have packed in Welcome Tour,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen said there’s more to Welcome Tour than it appears based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to. Based on what’s actually in the game, Nintendo decided $9.99 “is not an exorbitant price,” he continued.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/10/reggie-1744265519979.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie fought for Wii Sports as a Wii pack in.

That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Doubles Down on Players Not Owning Digital Games in The Crew Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-players-not-owning-digital-games-in-the-crew-lawsuit.1160100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft’s lawyers started contending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a class-action lawsuit</a> raised following the shutting down of The Crew, an MMO-based, live-service racing game, taking it offline for one and all. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ubisoft had ‘duped’ players into believing they were buying a game with permanent ownership. Ubisoft retorted that they were only ever buying a ‘license to play’ the game. In the latest update in the case, Ubisoft’s legal team has doubled down on that concept, and the plaintiffs have fired back with amendments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-unfettered-ownership">It’s Not ‘Unfettered Ownership’</h2>



<p>In a document dug up by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6qVUri3YEl-Rm1i2hUkopLGiFMB0vcfSJN_2XvFyiSWDUJc6EDhA_0kDCXkw_aem_vnLG_QctHg-dUb7i1mTNHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> (and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helpfully transcribed</a>), it was revealed that Ubisoft’s tenacious legal team filed to have the case thrown out of the California court. The team claimed – or rather, reiterated – that <em>‘customers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license.’</em></p>



<p>Per the original claim from the plaintiffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Ubisoft Inc. allegedly misled&nbsp;purchasers of its video&nbsp;game <em>The Crew</em> into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownershiprights in the game, rather than a&nbsp;limited license to access the game.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The recent amendments to the class-action suit saw the claimants leaning on the law surrounding gift certification sales in California. The hope is that they can stress that they were ‘robbed’ of digital currency, as in California, gift cards aren’t allowed to expire – but any in-game credits players had when The Crew was shut down did just that: they disappeared.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Ubisoft’s Director of Subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, went on record speaking about the transformation of gaming from a physical to a digital world. He suggested that players should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-not-owning-games-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘get comfortable’ with not owning their games</a> and instead acquiring limited licenses to play them.</p>



<p>Gamers have never forgotten these comments, and even today, folks on social media platforms worldwide will jibe Ubisoft fans with comments about them ‘renting their games.’</p>



<p>With the latest amendments having been made to the class-action lawsuit, Ubisoft has been given a new window in which to respond. We’ll have the latest on this case by April 29, which is the deadline.</p>



<p>Do you think Ubisoft is right, or are you on the side of the plaintiffs in complaining that digital ownership should also be <strong>permanent </strong>ownership? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As in previous years, it will be a double feature with a presentation dedicated to The Outer Worlds 2 airing immediately afterward.</p>

<p>The Xbox Showcase occurs during the week of Summer Game Fest and begins at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Like previous years, the event is a digital-only showcase, meaning it's pre-taped instead of being a live event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with the Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Directs the last two years, The Outer Worlds 2 Direct promises to reveal new gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG with an inside look at Obsidian Games and insights from its developers. The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-announcement-trailer-left-us-smiling">announced</a> in 2021, but got its first gameplay reveal during The Game Awards last December.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2</p>

</article><p>The 2024 Xbox Showcase revealed new titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-is-a-prequel-set-14-years-before-the-first-game">Gears of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/mixtape-is-a-sharp-looking-coming-of-age-story-with-music-from-devo">Mixtape</a>, provided updates and gameplay reveals for long-in-development titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-gets-first-impressive-gameplay-trailer">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-trailer-revealed-coming-to-game-pass-day-one">State of Decay 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/playground-games-fable-gets-2025-release-window-in-first-gameplay-trailer">Fable</a> (which was recently delayed to 2026), and showcased third-party titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/latest-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trailer-shows-all-gameplay">Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-a-fantastical-souls-like-action-rpg-set-during">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a good chance we could see some, if not most, of these titles make another appearance. Other titles that could appear include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QALOtq_13go">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> (which is being published by Xbox Game Studios), the noir action stealth deck-builder <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2024/03/06/sleight-of-hand-is-a-noir-stealth-action-sim-and-deckbuilder">Sleight of Hand</a> (an Xbox console exclusive), or the cozy survival game <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/winter-burrow">Winter Burrow</a>. We’ll have to tune in on June 8 to find out.</p>
