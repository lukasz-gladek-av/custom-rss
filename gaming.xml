            <p>
Of all the changes made in the transition from Overwatch 1 to 2, the move from 6v6 battles to 5v5 was undoubtedly one of its most controversial. And now developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has confirmed its's revisiting that decision, exploring if and how 6v6 matches could be re-introduced to Overwatch 2 in a series of upcoming tests.
</p>
<p>
All this is detailed in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog</a> from Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, who begins by explaining exactly why the move to 5v5 was made in the first place. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs," he writes, "but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."
</p>
<p>
As such, 5v5 was chosen to increase individual agency, to better balance the impact each class can have in a match, to make the experience more "cognitively manageable, and - perhaps most significantly of all - to alleviate extremely long queue times. "Players generally queue Tank less," continues Keller, "leading to longer wait times for all while we wait for a Tank to free up to find a proper match." And with Overwatch 2 requiring one rather than two tanks in competitive play, average wait times for damage and support characters are now "much shorter".

<p>
Despite these improvements, Keller acknowledges that some of the changes made to Overwatch over the years have come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom", and that the team gets feedback from players saying the experience can feel "the same" from game to game. Which brings us to Blizzard's future plans. Keller says that, based on player feedback, the studio is now looking to run a series of events that'll enable it to "try out different core team composition formats".
</p>
<p>
"Because we operate as a service to our players," he continues, "we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we'd prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration."

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
One reason for this cautiousness is technical performance. Keller says Blizzard has taken advantage of the reduced technical overheads in 5v5 matches to introduce upgrades and additions - ranging from allied outlines to more technically demanding hero kits - that will likely result in lower performance on older machines if 6v6 is re-introduced. Remedying this is expected to take "at least several seasons". Additionally, the studio needs to be "openly mindful not to frustrate" those players who've only ever experienced - and like - 5v5, and that's even before considering the queue issues that might resurface if 6v6 proves popular.
</p>
<p>
"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run," Keller adds, "and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that's a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."
</p>
<p>
Keller also believes at least some of Overwatch's perceived sameyness isn't actually to do with team sizes, but rather the composition of those teams - and so it'll also be re-examining "the ways we tried solving previous problems... We think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren't quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue." To that end, Season 13 will feature "at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea".
</p>
<p>
"This isn't the last time we’re going to be getting into 5v5 or 6v6, and we can't wait to share more about our plans in the future," Keller concludes. "In closing, we appreciate you so much, and we love seeing your passion and dedication."
</p>
<p>
Overwatch 2's 13th season is expected to get underway in October, but first there's Season 12, which'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-new-hero-is-space-ranger-juno-and-shes-available-to-play-today">introduce new space ranger hero Juno</a> when it arrives on 20th August.

In defense of the former, it <em>does</em> feature some of the tougher boss fights I’ve ever encountered. On the other hand, I’ve always felt like <em>Elden Ring </em>was a pretty malleable experience, and that it provided <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539">a lot of tools</a></span> to allow you to power through the game and ultimately come out the other side. To that end, I’ve maintained that this game isn’t <em>that </em>selective about who can enjoy it, and the years since have often proven me right.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You see, plenty of people who play FromSoftware’s famously difficult games love to make things even harder for themselves. Soulslike players froth at the mouth for a good challenge run, and that’s why you’ll often see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watch-a-guy-beat-sekiro-in-under-two-hours-blindfolded-1848372079&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watch-a-guy-beat-sekiro-in-under-two-hours-blindfolded-1848372079">blindfolded showcases</a></span> or hitless boss gauntlets at events like Summer Games Done Quick. With <em>Elden Ring</em>’s immense popularity, that scene kind of exploded and moved beyond straightforward challenges like level-1 runs, where the player isn’t allowed to level up for the entirety of the game. Instead, these challenges got exponentially weirder.</p><p>I’m talking about completely alternative ways of playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of playing the game with a controller or mouse and keyboard, some have taken to modding the game to support input from musical instruments. Others have used dance pads, and some have even used their brain to just look at the game and communicate inputs via brain waves. The <em>Elden Ring </em>community has proven how consistently inventive it is, and has managed to rise to utterly ridiculous challenges in bizarre and even byzantine ways, so I thought it might be fun to rattle off some of the most impressive methods players have used to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>bosses over the years. </p><h2 id="h204"><a id=""></a>Dance pad</h2><p>Arguably the most popular of the alternatives, dance pads have been a staple of Soulslike challenge runs for a long while, but they’ve never been bigger. That’s largely due to MissMikkaa, a streamer who’s taken it upon herself to try and beat <em>Elden Ring </em>via too many alternate methods. Her most famous runs have been ones where she’s aided (or hampered, depending on how you see it) by a dance pad. In the years since the release of <em>Elden Ring</em>, her runs have only grown increasingly more unhinged. At one point, she even took on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182">hardest boss fight twice simultaneously</a></span>, controlling one character with her dance pad and another with a standard PS5 controller. I could hardly beat Malenia <em>once</em> on a controller, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat spent more than 24 hours</a></span> trying to defeat her without summons, but sure, show off.</p><h2 id="h205"><a id=""></a><em>Donkey Kong </em>bongos</h2><p>Little known fact: the <em>Donkey Konga </em>rhythm series are some of the finest games of our lifetimes. I hold this to be true, even though I’ve never played them. Why then, would I make such an assertive statement? Because they gave us the best controllers ever: the <em>Donkey Kong </em>bongos.<br></p><p>I love a good rhythm game, and playing them inspired me to pick up the guitar at an early age, but <em>Rock Band</em>’s plastic drums don’t have shit on the <em>DK </em>Bongos. These utterly ridiculous controllers have been around for damn near 20 years at this point, and in that time, they’ve become a beloved bit of memorabilia <em>and </em>another popular alternative for challenge runs. If you don’t believe me, check out the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_accessories#DK_Bongos:~:text=They%20are%20commonly%20used%20in%20challenge%20runs%20as%20a%20non%2Dstandard%20control%20method%2C%20such%20as%20being%20used%20in%202020%20to%20beat%20Sekiro%3A%20Shadows%20Die%20Twice.%5B6%5D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_accessories#DK_Bongos:~:text=They%20are%20commonly%20used%20in%20challenge%20runs%20as%20a%20non%2Dstandard%20control%20method%2C%20such%20as%20being%20used%20in%202020%20to%20beat%20Sekiro%3A%20Shadows%20Die%20Twice.%5B6%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bongos’ Wikipedia page</a></span>, or take a look at this video.</p><p>If you’re going to make a hard game even more difficult for yourself, you may as well have some fun and look ridiculous while you’re at it, and nothing captures that quite like wailing on a bongo to do a jumping heavy attack, y’know?<br></p><h2 id="h206"><a id=""></a>An actual musical instrument</h2><p>Now if you’re a pretty well-rounded person, you may have picked up an <em>actual </em>instrument at some point in your life, rather than some plastic bongos. If that’s the case, congratulations, you’re skilled in ways that some people never get around to. Now, just imagine if you could harness that ability and channel it back into games. That’s what some people have managed over the years as they turned their favorite instruments into controllers and triumphed over <em>Elden Ring</em>’s numerous challenges.</p><p>That’s what Anna Ellsworth did a few years ago when she beat Margit the Fell Omen by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-anna-ellsworth-harp-margit-fell-omen-tree-se-1849071184&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-anna-ellsworth-harp-margit-fell-omen-tree-se-1849071184">plucking the strings of her harp</a></span>.

Another streamer who relishes unorthodox challenge runs, Perri most recently beat a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span>’s bosses with her mind. Utilizing an electroencephalogram that basically reads her brain activity, as well as some eye-tracking technology, she has been able to decimate <em>Elden Ring</em>’s gallery of godly rogues with little more than her thoughts and the blink of an eye. Talk about putting those bosses in their place.</p><h2 id="h208"><a id=""></a>Morse code</h2><p>Though I’d heard of most of the other challenge runs featured here, this is the most surprising one I hadn’t heard about until I started doing research for this piece. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">Spanish streamer Silithur</a></span> managed to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>a few months ago with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morse code</a></span>! That’s right, a single button and way too many dashes and dots to count, but the guy fucking did it. He even snuck in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">dunk on Elon Musk</a></span> in the process. How do you tap out, “Holy shit, you’re a legend” in Morse?</p><h2 id="h209"><a id=""></a>A fish</h2><p>I’m not sure what I could write that properly captures what a feat this is. This goldfish is just built different. Better than most of us, even. We could all stand to learn a thing or two from them.</p><h2 id="h210"><a id=""></a>Full-body motion controller</h2><p>Sometimes you play a game so good you just want to live in it, perils and all. Well that’s what the streamer Luality kind of accomplished by turning her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole body into her <em>Elden Ring </em>controller</a></span>. With the help of some motion controls, the streamer turned <em>Elden Ring </em>into a full-body experience. If she wanted to dodge, she would bob in that direction and if she wanted to attack she would make a swiping motion with her hand, as if she was actually armed. She even bound the healing flask to her making a drinking motion with one of her hands. The results are as chaotic, frustrating, and funny as you might expect.</p><h2 id="h211"><a id=""></a>Ring Fit Wheel (and all the other wild ways this guy modded the game)</h2><p>While doing some research for this list, I came across one YouTube channel that has, over the years, put a lot of effort into playing <em>Elden Ring </em>with increasingly bizarre controllers. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Louis 64</a></span>’s whole thing is actually that he seems to love gimmicky controls and makes a bunch of unique ones from scratch. Boy, has he found a lot of different ways in which to play <em>Elden Ring</em>, folks.</p><p>I am most familiar with his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>set up</a></span>, where he uses that game’s unique wheel-like controller to exercise while also dodge-rolling and plugging away at bosses in <em>Elden Ring</em>. His contraptions don’t end there, though. Just a month ago, the guy figured out how to make a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully functional bow and arrow controller</a></span> from a kids’ toy. Before that, he literally built a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatsword from <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and turned it into a controller. He’s also famously played the game with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617">controller fashioned from bananas</a></span>.

A tetraplegic player—meaning they’re paralyzed from the neck down— shared a video of themselves overcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s motherfucker of a final boss <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a mouth controller</a></span>. I don’t know about you, but it’s maybe one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I’ve yet to get to the end of the expansion, but I’m sure that fight’s going to take me hundreds of tries to beat unless I use a very busted build. Some of the most seasoned <em>Elden Ring </em>players are fully abled and struggle against it. It literally either takes grit, complete mastery of the game, or an intense exploitation to do this fight with both hands, but here’s someone who can clear it without the use of any. That’s a goddamn hero right there. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ll be hitting the picket line a year after Hollywood actors and writers wrapped up their own historic strikes in an escalation that could have big consequences for the development and marketing of some of the industry’s biggest games.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) voted last fall to authorize a strike citing an unwillingness of big game companies to budge on guaranteeing performers rights over how their work is used in training AI or creating AI-generated copies. Roughly 2,600 voice actors and motion capture artists, including talents like Troy Baker from <em>The Last of Us</em>, Jennifer Hale from <em>Mass Effect</em>, and Matt Mercer from<em> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, have been working without an Interactive Media Agreement since November 2022. The strike starts on July 26 at 12:01 a.m.</p><p> “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games,” chief negotiator  Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement. “That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.”</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117">Video Game Voice Actors Are Ready To Strike Over AI.

Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”<br></p><p> While games set to come out this fall like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, who’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently revealed voice cast</a></span> includes several guild members, likely already have their voice and motion-capture work completed, the strike means SAG-AFTRA members would be unavailable for projects that are years out, and wouldn’t be around to record for any potential last-minute re-writes for things that are closer to coming out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-6v6-is-returning-in-new-tests/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>After nearly two years of the community voicing frustrations, Blizzard has announced that Overwatch 2 6v6 will be coming back. This return comes in the form of new tests to decide if the game will permanently go back to 6v6 or stick with 5v5.</p>



<p>“The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,” game director Aaron Keller said in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on the Overwatch website</a>. “Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-overwatch-2-returned-to-6v6-gameplay">Why Hasn’t Overwatch 2 Returned To 6v6 Gameplay?</h2>



<p>As far as why they will run tests of the mode instead of a full scale return, Keller says there are a few reasons for the decision. The first, he says, is to make sure the game can be optimized for 12-player matches.</p>



<p>“There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game,” he said. “These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps.”</p>



<p>He added that in 6v6 play, the updates can cause performance issues on older systems.</p>



<p>The second big reason, which he says gives him “anxiety about opening this Pandora’s Box”, involves match queue times if 6v6 becomes a permanent addition to the game.</p>



<p>“The team was not able to solve this issue previously,” he said. “While we have some ideas now, there’s no guarantee that they will work. Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that’s a pretty risky move to make.”</p>



<p>He closed by saying that the Overwatch team’s goal is to continue to build a game “that you want to play season after season”, even if that means the return of 6v6.</p>

<p>What do you think of Overwatch 2 bringing back 6v6, at least with test matches for now?

                <p>CPU manufacturer AMD has announced it's delaying the release of its new Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs after discovering that some of the first chips to come off the assembly line were lacking in quality. Previously scheduled to arrive in late July, the processors will now become available for purchase in August.</p><p dir="ltr">"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processor," AMD senior VP and GM of computing and graphics Jack Huynh <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1816210711254639031" rel="nofollow ">said on Twitter</a>. "During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units. As a result, there will be a short delay in retail availability."</p><p dir="ltr">The delay affects four Ryzen 9000 series processors, all of which were initially scheduled for a July 31 launch. The four products affected by the delay--and their new release dates--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 5 9600X:</strong> Thursday, August 8</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 9700X:</strong> Thursday, August 8</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 9900X:</strong> Thursday, August 15</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X:</strong> Thursday, August 15</li></ul><p dir="ltr">"Apologies for the delay," Huynh added. "We pride ourselves in providing a high quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series."</p><p>AMD has yet to reveal how much each processor will cost, but it appears that French tech retailer PC21 has accidentally leaked some of the processors' prices (via <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9000-processors-prices-listed-by-french-retailer-european-ryzen-9-9900x-price-converts-to-nearly-dollar750" rel="nofollow ">Tom's Hardware</a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/matteo-menapace-co-designer-of-daybreak-has-been-banned-from-spiel-des-jahres<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Germany held its annual Spiel des Jahres event. It is one of the biggest award shows in the tabletop industry, rewarding sharp game design and excellent quality. And one of its winners, Matteo Menapace, has been permanently banned from all future events. This was due to a sticker he chose to wear, and the message it sent.</p>

<p>The banning of Matteo Menapace from Spiel des Jahres was announced via post on their <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/preisverleihung-kennerspiel-des-jahres-2024/">official website</a>. The post explains the reason for Menapace's ban. While attending the event, Menapace wore a sticker on stage in the Palestinian national colors represented as a watermelon.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=iScPIyM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=Bd8z8PR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The small sticker was attached to Menapace's t-shirt during the event. During the event, the sticker was not noticed. However, shortly after, chairman Harald Schrapers and deputy chairman Christoph Schlewinski asked Menapace to hand over the sticker, forbade him to show it during photographs, and said he would no longer be welcome at future award events.</p>
<p>According to the Spiel des Jahres association, the intended message of this sticker, that of a "Great Palestine" denies the existence of the State of Israel. In context, this is an expression of antisemitism, which exceeded the limits of legitimate political expression at the event.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it goes against the organization's "Playing For Tolerance" initiative, which is against any form of racism and antisemitism. This initiative has been in place for years.</p>
<p>Matteo Menapace and Matt Leacock won this year's Kennerspiel des Jahres award for complex games at Spiel des Jahres. The award was for their climate action-focused board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334986/daybreak"><em>Daybreak</em></a> (aka <em>e-mission</em> in Germany).</p>
<p>It is a co-op experience where you and your friends control a global power. Your goal is to dismantle the causes of climate change and reduce global emissions to net zero. In addition, you must help reform and rebuild world societies that protect people from life-threatening crises. If global temps get too high or if too many people are in crisis, you all lose.</p>

Today’s <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog post from the developers</a> at Blizzard says that, finally, “we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.” </p><p>Game director Aaron Keller also notes that issues like hero balancing, game performance, and what might happen to queue times if players have a choice between the two formats are questions the team needs to answer but is at least ready to start considering.</p><p>Other than making a full-priced game free to play and laying out promises about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725808/overwatch-2-hero-mode-canceled-2023-roadmap">player-vs-environment content</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/19/23730369/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-cancellation">weren’t exactly fulfilled</a>, the shift to <em>Overwatch 2</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes">removed one tank player</a> from each team. Removing one of the largest characters who dealt and received the most punishment made things much simpler but also made it seem like the outcome of the game depended a little too much on that one role. </p><p>If your tank is getting countered or outplayed — there’s often not a lot left to do.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Activision Blizzard</cite></p></div><p>So, should they bring the old style back? It’s not really that simple. I’ve played the game in all roles throughout all of these iterations, and I see arguments on both sides of the issue. There’s no question that the new game has better queue times, which the post attributes to the fact that the actual number of players queueing for each role has always more closely fit a ratio of one tank per team.</p><p>But even in the old system, I agree that the games were chaotic, and now there’s a playerbase full of people who’ve never experienced it. Good luck explaining ultimate combos to someone who might have never heard most of the voice lines from tank teammates talking to each other.</p><p>While it’s unclear when the 6v6 playtests will happen, Keller says that at least one “Hacked” event this season will try out “other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue,” to see how the developers can address some issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>If you can't betray your friends in the middle of an arcade or party game, are you even having fun?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'll always have a soft spot for the games I'd play with my friends for hours at a time while we jostled each other on the couch and screamed at each other for any perceived betrayal. You know the ones: your Mario Karts and Mario Parties. Games where forging flimsy alliances against the one player who is perceived as the greatest threat, or being a filthy scumbag of a traitor who delights in chaos, are things that are not actually a part of the core gameplay loop in these games, but we as a society have decided that they should be. They are the video game Unos of the world. Racing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deathsprint-66/" data-ref-id="5000-623102">DeathSprint 66</a> is shaping up to be that kind of experience. I've played DeathSprint 66 twice now--once at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a> and again recently at a preview event--and both times, the game tickled the lizard part of my brain that enjoys snatching away a victory from a friend at the last minute and offering up nothing more than a coy smile.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 sees you and seven other players (or bots!) race around tracks at breakneck speeds, utilizing augmented suits to sprint at high speeds, drift around corners, grind along rails, wall-run, and make incredible acrobatic leaps. All the while, the track and the other players pose as constant dangers--shifting laser grids and massive buzzsaws dot each track and items like heat-seeking drones and landmines can be picked up and used by you and your competitors. It's a dangerous competition, but thankfully you're only racing as your character's clone--and you bring a handful of backups with you to each race, so every blood splatter or eviscerated limb is only a few seconds of delay in your day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527" data-ratio="0.546875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527"></a><figcaption>Don't worry about losing your legs--your character has several backup clones who can jump into the race.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nearly every aspect of DeathSprint 66 is geared around the mayhem and the process of taking advantage of others to improve your own chances of success (running directly behind a competitor and in the draft they create, for example, grants you a quick burst of speed to pass them by). DeathSprint 66 is ripe for friendly betrayal, and I felt nostalgic for Sonic Riders while playing it (the first one, obviously; not its weird sequels). It's also very approachable--though the tougher tracks are trickier to get around, DeathSprint 66 is a mechanically simple game, and a few runs around each track will give you a pretty good idea of where you can go. Once you grasp that understanding, it's just a question of practice. If you've played an arcade racer like Mario Kart or Sonic Riders, you already have an understanding of the type of game DeathSprint 66 is.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are a few ways in which DeathSprint 66 falls short of what's come before. The most blatant is the aesthetic variety of the tracks, which is to say there isn't any. Though each track offers a unique challenge in terms of its layout--you've got your traditional figure-eight, for instance, and then your more dastardly setups like one track that sees you needing to regularly get over huge pits of saw blades--they all take place in the same city and largely look the same. That's not a dealbreaker for me when it comes to wanting to grab DeathSprint 66, but it does interfere with any of the tracks developing any sort of personality.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528"></a><figcaption>I'd like to see a little bit more variety when it comes to character customization.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This issue extends to character creation, too. You can customize your character somewhat, fitting them with different racing suits and picking from a collection of different color schemes, but it's not enough--you can't easily distinguish between different racers once everyone is in motion. If someone is going to throw a buzzsaw at me, I want to know exactly who to blame before they have a chance to fake how they don't know what I'm talking about. And if I see someone wallrunning behind me, I want to be able to know exactly which of my friends I should be making a deal with before betraying said sucker.</p><p dir="ltr">These aspects of competitive arcade racers--knowing the track and being able to identify your competitors at a glance--aren't crucial to the genre, but they do make them more fun, and it's disappointing to see DeathSprint 66 not running out of the gate with that already locked down. As a live-service game, it's entirely possible new tracks will be added post-launch that are aesthetically distinct from what the game starts with, and that additional character customization options could be implemented that are more wacky and visually clear-cut than the generic choices the game is starting with. But the structure of the game is already a great time, and I can't wait to trick my friends into picking it up on the promise that it will be a chill time for all.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 is set to launch on PC in 2024.</p>

<p>NYXL – the parent company of the New York Subliners – has just revealed that the NYSL brand is closing down. This news comes mere weeks after the announcement that the Subliners and Cloud9 had partnered ahead of the Esports World Cup. It wasn’t made clear how this new partnership would impact the CDL team’s branding, but now the epic change has been unveiled – the New York Subliners (by brand, at least) are no more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line">End of the Line</h2>



<p>The New York Subliners have been a hugely impactful force in the Call of Duty League for years. From being an underdog squad in the Cold War season to dominating an entire year of gameplay and winning COD Champs in 2023, the squad has come up <strong>fast</strong>. For the longest time, fans have followed the ins and outs of this team, learning transparently what goes on behind the doors of the Subliners.</p>



<p>It was announced today that the New York Subliners is being shut down from a branding perspective. Here’s the message (and the emotional montage) that was posted online:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>1 💍, 6 🥇, 3 🥈 , the first New York homestand, and countless other memories. To all our fans, thank you for your love and support over the past 5 years. It has been an incredible journey, and we’re grateful to have experienced it with all of you.</p><p>Signing out. </p><p>-NYXL… <a href="https://t.co/57z1fdnTFB">pic.twitter.com/57z1fdnTFB</a></p></div>— Subliners (@Subliners) <a href="https://twitter.com/Subliners/status/1816519252137881962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Cloud9 responded to this post by stressing: ‘This isn’t the end, just a new beginning’. It’s a direct indication that C9 will make a grand re-entry to the Call of Duty scene next season. It was always a guaranteed thing that the Subliners squad would represent C9’s brand at the Esports World Cup, but nobody thought that the CDL-focused brand would dissipate.</p>



<p>Days ago, the New York Subliners came in second place at COD Champs, with OpTic Texas securing a massive win – the organisation’s first world championship victory since 2017.</p>



<p>I’ve since reached out to sources close to the Subliners to see if there’s more information about what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see the back of the Subliners, or excited about what might come from C9 during the 2025 CDL season?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard Entertainment has laid out plans to begin testing for the potential return of 6v6 matchups in Overwatch 2…eventually.</p><p>The update on the controversy plaguing the Overwatch community comes from game director Aaron Keller, who posted a 3600-word <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director’s Take blog post</a> on the subject today. It’s a lengthy statement on the history of 6v6, why <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pvp-will-now-be-5v5-not-6v6"><u>it was removed with the launch of Overwatch 2</u></a>, and how Blizzard plans to experiment with the mode once again. That’s right – the team is interested in bringing back the 12-player option nearly two years after it was swapped out for the faster-paced 5v5 mode.</p><p>“The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,” Keller says. “Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/ow2-f2p-trailerthumbnail-1920x1080-1721888065622.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is re-examining the possibility of 6v6 in Overwatch 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller says that while the team remains focused on ironing out 5v5, it is also “looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2.” Even the smallest sign of 6v6 is enough to reignite interest in players who have begged for its return, but implementing these tests is not as simple as just flipping a switch. Technological challenges presented by 12-player lobbies is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome. The game director explains that, while the team is investigating a permanent performance increase across all platforms, it’s a “large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish.” There’s also the issue of queue times, which could be potentially inflated across the entire Overwatch 2 experience should something like 6v6 stick around.</p><p>No matter how badly some players want 6v6 back, alterations to the Overwatch 2 formula present new challenges to overcome. Though Keller says a new iteration of Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team assembly at some point during Season 13, it’s not exactly clear when official testing will begin. He cautions that this proposed reintroduction of 6v6 will be a long process and that today’s post is only the “start of this conversation.”</p><p>“We’d run the test for a few weeks and gauge interest from the community,” Keller explains when speaking on the benefit of the tests. “Then we’d measure the impact it had on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, Arcade, etc. We’d take the lessons from this playtest to see what we can learn about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of Overwatch. We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that’s a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out.”</p><h2>Let’s break it down</h2><p>Overwatch launched in 2016 and has since slowly evolved into an entirely different beast. As Blizzard has worked to establish fair and fun game environments, it has added, gutted, and altered a wide variety of game modes. As noted by Keller, these changes include stricter Hero limits in Quick Play, the addition of the more rigid mode known as Role Queue, and of course, the switch to 5v5.</p><p>The original Overwatch used the 6v6 format as its go-to structure until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-will-replace-the-original-game-at-launch">the entire experience was replaced with Overwatch 2 in 2022</a>. This free-to-play sequel swapped in 5v5 matches, with Blizzard’s reasoning at the time being that it would reduce battlefield clutter and lead to a cleaner, more enjoyable experience for all three roles – Tank, Damage, and Support. Keller stands by the decision, saying that 5v5 is “more cognitively manageable” than the 6v6 matchups. It also led to drastically shorter queue times in Role Queue, especially for those who queued up to play Damage Heroes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/overwatch-2-queue-time-chart-1721931042820.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A chart shared by Aaron Keller highlighting 5v5 and 6v6 Ranked Play queue times per role.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller acknowledges that 6v6 still has its upsides, and the decision to remove it was not made lightly. Still, there are those who prefer the original format to this day and have even campaigned for its return. Calls for Blizzard to include a 6v6 option reached a boiling point the last few months, with many players complaining that 5v5 is more punishing on an individual level, especially when queueing up to play Tank. With tensions in the Overwatch community rising, Blizzard has finally stepped in.</p><p>Keller has been <a href="https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teasing plans to offer more insight into Blizzard's point of view for several weeks</u></a>, and today’s post likely goes into more detail than many were expecting. However, as the director mentioned, the studio has a lot of work and listening to do before team composition tests begin, and even then, it’s unclear if these experiments will yield the results its community desires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Overwatch 2 Season 11 Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Overwatch 2 is barreling toward the end of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-teases-transformers-collab-in-season-11-trailer">Season 11</a> of its post-launch roadmap. While details on how Season 12 will up the ante mostly remain a mystery, the studio did just wrap up a weekend playtest for its new Support Hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">Juno</a>, an agile space-themed competitor with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-voice-line-debunks-long-running-fan-theory-in-the-funniest-way-possible">interesting ties to the Overwatch universe</a>.

                <p>Less than two years after the release of Overwatch 2, game director Aaron Keller has announced that Blizzard is now open to reversing one of the series' biggest--and most contentious--decisions: its shift to 5v5 gameplay.</p><p>Keller shared the news in his latest <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Director's Take</a>, a regular blog he publishes to help keep fans up to date on key decisions. In it, Keller explained the reasons why the studio pivoted away from Overwatch's 6v6 gameplay, as well as laid out a rough plan to implement 6v6 battles back into the game through a "series of events" most likely taking place "several seasons" down the road.</p><p>"The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. 'Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results?' We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results," Keller wrote.</p><p>If all these plans sounds a bit loose, it's because they are. As for why we don't have concrete dates or event names yet, Keller was quick to explain that the transition back to 6v6 is somewhat of a logistical nightmare for "reasons that may not be readily apparent." To attempt to explain these reasons, he offered up a "Historical Overview" of Overwatch as well as several paragraphs outlining why he believes 5v5 best suits Overwatch 2.</p><p>According to Keller, the introduction of Hero Limits--and subsequently Role Queues--in the original Overwatch played a large role in the team's decision to make Overwatch 2 5v5. Data collected by the team revealed that queue times were dramatically shorter when only ten players were needed to start a game--particularly for those playing the game's most popular role, Damage. Keller also explained that the switch was made to offer "greater individual agency" to players.</p><p>"Many times, fights in 6v6 couldn’t resolve until ultimate abilities came online. Correct that, until ultimate combos could be executed to break through two tanks worth of mitigation supported by high, uncontested healing output," Keller wrote. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."</p><p>Keller went on to explain that "tank synergy wasn't always fun," and that the inclusion of two tanks on a team could "absolutely grind [a game] to a halt." Seeing as Overwatch 2 is more focused on being a fast-paced FPS now, 5v5--and the elimination of one of the game's two tank roles--felt vital to executing that idea. He also noted that it was simply harder to follow 6v6 combat, as "tracking nine other players is easier than 11." Keller called the switch to 5v5 "a bit more cognitively manageable."</p><p>Despite all of this, however, Keller admits there were plenty of things he enjoyed about 6v6, such as its charmingly chaotic energy. He also stated that the stakes perhaps felt a bit lower in 6v6, as an extra player mitigated the damage caused by someone "performing poorly." Naturally, lower stakes can lead to players experiencing more fun.</p><p>And yet, pivoting back to 6v6 doesn't seem entirely simple. The largest reason for this, Keller wrote, is that they need to implement the 6v6 tests in a way that "allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I'm referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match."</p><p>"There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game. These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps," Keller explained. "In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player’s experience. While a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game. This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish."</p><p>Keller also noted that another issue "that still gives [him] anxiety about opening this Pandora's Box" is queue times. Keller concluded that gathering data from these tests--particularly data regarding queue times, overall performance, and player feedback--will be incredibly valuable.</p><p>"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for," Keller said. "Whether that’s a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."</p>

            <p>
Maybe you've heard of Kamala Harris; she's the current US vice president and very likely the Democratic party's official presidential nominee for November's US election. But now she's firmly back in the spotlight, the mildly curious case of her secret life in developer Remedy's 2019 action-adventure Control has resurfaced online.
</p>
<p>
You see, pinned to a whiteboard in an unassuming corner of The Oldest House - the transdimensional Brutalist office block at the heart of Control's story - is a picture of a missing 40-year-old Bureau employee, Jane Farland, lost during one of the House's shifts. Only, Photoshopped eyes aside, Jane Farland is the spitting image of Vice President Harris.
</p>
<p>
Harris' surprise secret life as a fictitious video game character has been noted before - in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/d0rhzv/kamala_harris_apparently_exists_as_a_different/">five-year-old Reddit thread</a>, for instance - but the picture has started gaining traction again as Harris once again makes headlines thanks to her likely US presidential bid.

<p>
Unfortunately, the story behind the image is a little harder to uncover. Journalist Stephen Totilo tried to get to the bottom of it as part of his latest <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, first pinpointing the image's location to a whiteboard near an elevator in Control's Central Executive hub.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Totilo's attempts to get a comment from Remedy on Harris' appearance in Control have so far been met with silence (I've reached out to the developer, just in case it's feeling chattier today), but the real answer is likely to be a fairly boring one.
</p>
<p>
The image appears to be an only lightly doctored official photo from Harris' time as a US Senator. And given US government materials are generally in the public domain, Remedy would be free to use Harris' headshot if it was Googling "US federal employee in a business suit" for its missing person whiteboard (notably, Harris isn't the only real-life US senator who appears there). One eye-tweak later and - ta da! - another in-game asset is complete.

			<p>One of the biggest changes made by Blizzard to Overwatch 2 is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-pvp-5v5-maps-hero-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch</a> from 6v6 matches to 5v5. However, a sizable amount of fans of the original game remained vocal about reintroducing 6v6 in some form, and the developers are taking that feedback seriously.</p>
<p>Today, Game Director Aaron Keller explained the hurdles it'll have to overcome first. The first and biggest reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance with 12 players in a match: a number of upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 impact the game's performance. In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can significantly impact players using older systems.</p>
<p>While a time-limited Overwatch 2 test could come sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently improve performance across the entire game. This endeavor will likely take at least several seasons, said Blizzard.</p>
<p>Another issue is what to do with queue times, which was the main reason for switching from 6v6 to 5v5 in the first place. They have some ideas, but there's no guarantee they'll work. Moreover, Blizzard understandably wishes to make sure that those who enjoy the game as it is today are not frustrated by these attempts to reintroduce 6v6.</p>
<p>The current objective is to run a test for a few weeks and gauge the community's interest. Then, the developers would measure its impact on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, arcade, etc. They'd use the lessons from that playtest to see what could be learned about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of the franchise. They would carefully ponder on the learnings from each test and how they can best give players what they want. Whether that's a 5v5 world, a 6v6 world, or both will be figured out in the future.</p>
<p>In other Overwatch 2 news, the first Mythic weapon skin was <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this week, giving Reinhardt fans a cool new cosmetic to purchase.</p>

All of those changes have led to where we are today, a spot that many feel is stagnant and unenjoyable.<br></p><p>Role Queue ensures you’re not playing competitive matches with no healers (which was incredibly frustrating in the original game), but Keller acknowledges that this consistency made <em>Overwatch </em>“start to feel samey.” I’ve played hundreds of hours of competitive <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and so many of my matches have blurred together into a streak of sameness. “Could there be an in-between version that softens the original problems without completely solving them and also isn’t quite as reactive as our current Role Queue system?” Keller wonders.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, the shift to 5v5 also somewhat flattened <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s gameplay. “The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs but reaaaaally low, lows,” Keller wrote. “One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of those high moments.” The 5v5 change removed the secondary tank role, which helps prevent matches from getting stunlocked and drastically reduces queue times, but also fundamentally alters the way every single role is played.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support players, no longer tasked with keeping two massive tanks afloat, have to be more aggressive, adding their damage to an already high-damage pool thanks to the dual DPS characters. And the tank, rather than having a secondary, or off-tank, to support them, is now the biggest hero on the field and the most likely to bear the brunt of every enemy player’s damage and utilities. Tanks now play to exist, to stay alive, rather than playmake.<br></p><p>“Having two [tanks] allowed one to focus on protecting their backline while the other held ground or pushed into the enemy team,” Keller writes about 6v6. “The tank role had a lot of depth in understanding how to work with the other tank on the team.” And as <em>Overwatch</em> players have pointed out, so many of the tanks’ existing kits are tailored for 6v6 play, which too-often renders off-tank choices like Wrecking Ball completely unviable, especially in competitive matches.<br></p><p>The struggle to balance tanks for 5v5 play has persisted for nearly two years. In June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261">Blizzard admitted that</a></span> tanks were miserable to play after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">damage hero passive</a></span> weakened healing and made them feel like they were made of glass, and a subsequent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869">tank-focused patch wildly overcorrected</a></span>, making them far too powerful.<br></p><p>“The past year and a half has shown us that there are issues with balancing tanks for 5v5, as well [as 6v6],” the blog post reads. No shit.<br></p><h2 id="h46"><a id=""></a><strong>Five versus six</strong></h2><p>The crux of what many players believe is the issue with the 5v5 swap is that the majority of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s characters, maps, and modes were built for 6v6 play. Some suggest that Blizzard, rather than making major changes like nerfing shields (which would render problematic <em>Overwatch 1</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metas like pirate ship</a></span> useless), the team just pulled the second tank. Pulling that second tank removes freedom of choice for tank players and robs us of the variety of gameplay styles and approaches that comes from finding the perfect balance between two tanks.<br></p><p>It also puts more pressure on the supports to keep that singular tank afloat, while ensuring that DPS players have to choose specific heroes to counter the singular, beefed-up enemy tank. Not to mention the burden the singular tank player has to bear—if they can’t keep up with the enemy tank, matches are wildly unfun for them and their squad.<br></p><p>Warring team composition factions within the <em>Overwatch </em>community are nearly split right down the middle, as evidenced by a March poll from former OWL esports player Jake Lyon, in which 51.9% of players said they preferred 5v5 to the original 6v6 supporters’ 48.1%. That almost-even split tells me one thing: this is more about personal preference than what is objectively better, as there are downsides to both formats. As Keller writes in the blog, “Our players have different opinions and preferences about the ideal number of players in an <em>Overwatch</em> match, and so does our team.”</p><p>For more flexible, top-down players, 5v5 is a perfectly fine experience, as they can easily swap between any character in their role’s roster to ensure the match is a success. For people like myself, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060">former Moira one-trick</a></span> who expanded her support roster to five or so solid picks, 5v5 can feel incredibly limiting—and therefore frustrating. As Keller and others have made clear, there are pros and cons to both versions of <em>Overwatch</em>’s core multiplayer mode. There’s no singular, simplistic solution to this problem that Blizzard has inadvertently created.</p><figure id="" data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h47"><a id=""></a><strong>Now what?</strong></h2><p>Keller’s blog post is clear: Blizzard is “focused on making 5v5 the best experience that it can be.” But, the team is also “open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback.” As we’ve seen in the last year or so, Blizzard has experimented with gameplay changes in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812">Quick Play: Hacked mode</a></span>, including increasing the speed of objective captures and payload movement (a change it ultimately kept in the game). An upcoming Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team comps in ways “that aren’t quite as rigid as set composition but not as loose as Open Queue.” But what about 6v6?<br></p><p>“We’re looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in <em>Overwatch 2</em>,” Keller promises. He doesn’t outline what those events will be or what they’ll entail, but I don’t envy the work Blizzard will have to do if it plans on implementing 6v6 in any form. As much as myself and other disgruntled <em>Overwatch</em> players would like to think it’s as simple as offering both 6v6 and 5v5 Quickplay and Competitive modes, there is a lot going on under the hood that could break.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>’s updated UI and improved graphics could creak and strain with the addition of two more heroes in each match, and changes made to hero’s kits could feel either perfectly balanced or wildly off depending on whether you’re in a 5v5 or 6v6 match. And Keller voices concerns with “opening Pandora’s box” when it comes to queue times, which will likely increase with the inclusion of an extra player on your squad. “The team was not able to solve this problem previously,” he admits. But would 6v6 loyalists even care that they have to wait longer to get their preferred game mode back?<br></p><p>This latest Director’s Take promises that “this isn’t the last time [Blizzard will] be getting into 5v5 or 6v6,” so I’m sure the debate will continue on for many more months. I just want to get out of gold in support, please. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Want to find a career in the world of esports? With competitive video games constantly on the rise, more and more career options within the field are opening up. But is esports a good career? And what type of career options are there in competitive video games? In this guide, we’re breaking down everything that you need to know about getting a job in esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-find-a-good-career-in-esports">Can You Find a Good Career In Esports?</h2>



<p>New career options in esports are popping up every day. As the industry continues to grow, people are beginning to find new roles that need to be accompanied. Let’s not forget that a career in competitive video games is relatively new, meaning there is still so much for us to learn about it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is working in esports a good career move? Or is it just a failure waiting to happen? Well, it depends on what section of esports you are looking to create a career in.</p>







<h2 id="h-esport-career-options">Esport Career Options</h2>



<p>There are plenty of career options in esports. Many do not require a college degree – most personalities and experts working in esports got there without any formal qualification <strong>in an esports capacity</strong>. It can be tough to make a living in some roles though, and salaries are typically a little lower than in closely competing career paths.</p>



<p>For instance, holding a career as a professional player is incredibly difficult. It’s the same as being a professional athlete. You have to take care of yourself while also devoting your life to whatever game you play. And still, you are not guaranteed a spot at the top. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, many other career options in competitive gaming could be considered suitable for those without top-tier gaming skills. It’s not all about the players, after all – an esports career can be quite diverse. Finding the best career in esports, though, is subjective, as it just matters what type of skillsets you can bring to the table.</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of different esports careers:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Esports Journalist</li>



<li>Esports Caster</li>



<li>Tournament Coordinator</li>



<li>Player Manager</li>



<li>Team Manager</li>



<li>PR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>HR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>Broadcast Director</li>



<li>Broadcast Worker</li>



<li>Event Worker</li>



<li>Esports Marketing</li>



<li>Content Creator</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is a broad list of esports careers, there are still many other options out there that may not even seem plausible. Over the last ten years or so, the industry has blossomed, and around the world, there are <strong>thousands </strong>of esports job opportunities.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-an-esports-career">How To Get An Esports Career</h2>



<p>Figuring out how to find a job in esports can be quite difficult. There are very few colleges offering esports-related degrees at the moment, meaning many people will have to get their foot in the door elsewhere.</p>



<p>Luckily, many degrees such as PR, Marketing, Business Management and more can easily help you find a job in the world of esports. The only issue, though, is many jobs are hoping you have some sort of experience relating to competitive video games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So, how do you get that experience? How does someone get a career in esports? Well, making connections is a great place to start. Go to events, meet people, create a presence online, and start creating your own esports-related content or blogs. Hiring managers want to see dedication towards the industry when they sit down to interview you.</p>



<p>Sure, you may get lucky and get hired in the world of esports after being fresh out of college with just a basic marketing degree, but if you can show a future employer that you have already begun to make a name for yourself in the industry, then you will have a much better chance at receiving a job.</p>



<h2 id="h-ultimately-is-esports-a-good-career">Ultimately, Is Esports a Good Career?</h2>



<p>This is one of those verticals that’s getting more popular all the time, so it’s of course becoming more competitive. Trends are emerging, requiring jobseekers to seek higher qualifications for jobs in esports, and many roles want multifaceted employees who have transferable skills in several areas. For instance, you could be a Social Media Manager for an esports organisation, but they’d want you to have photo and video editing experience, community management experience, and even qualifications or experience in journalism – or <strong>psychology</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, esports is a good career choice because it’s so dynamic, and you’ll be working at the forefront of one of the most exciting industries in the technical world. Everyone working in esports is spearheading the growth of the industry, and hundreds of millions of fans have their eyes fixed firmly on everything that happens within it.</p>



<p>If you’re happy accepting a lower-than-average salary and working a little harder to stay innovative and dynamic, then yes, esports is a good career – it also helps if you <strong>love </strong>competitive gaming.</p>

Additionally, there will be a native version of the game on Steam, and players won't have to use the EA App (the successor to Origin) to play it on PC.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>This is a stark contrast to EA's previous games, which required players to have the EA app to play on PC. However, the game will still need players to agree to a third-party EULA, as noted by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. This year, there was particular blowback with other publishers requiring third-party accounts to play Steam games, most notably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p>BioWare also said that it will be providing more details about the game's launch later this summer. It's due out sometime this fall for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. So far, there's been quite a bit info out there about the game, including it having a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-no-death-setting/1100-6524662/" data-ref-id="1100-6524662">no-death option</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-explains-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-not-open-world/1100-6524197/" data-ref-id="1100-6524197">being mission-based rather than open-world</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/" data-ref-id="1100-6524909">apparently a lot of nudity</a>.</p>

If inventory completely runs out, check back in a few days for restocks.</p><p>With that out of the way, here's a look at all the Hello Kitty Razer gear up for grabs.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2522" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525297 - Razer Hello Kitty 50th Anniversary" data-collection="" title="6525297 - Razer Hello Kitty 50th Anniversary">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset/dp/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset\/dp\/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset/dp/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kraken Kitten V2 Wireless Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset/dp/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset\/dp\/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Kitty-Wireless-Headset/dp/B0D7YMGSDX?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$140</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Along with premium 40mm drivers and integrated noise-canceling microphones, the Kraken Kitten V2 is built with an adorable set of cat ears and a bowtie on its headband.
