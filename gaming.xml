            <p>Pragmata - Capcom's long in the pipeline astronaut and small girl-starring game - has had its release window narrowed down once again.</p>
<p>Pragmata will arrive on PS5 at some point in 2026, the developer announced during this evening's State of Play. The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-next-gen-project-pragamata-wont-launch-until-2022">once planned for a 2022 release</a>, having been originally revealed in 2020.</p>
<p>The news was shared with a new trailer, which you can check out below. "A Science Fiction adventure with a unique two-in-one twist of action and strategy," reads the description.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/romeo-is-a-dead-man-is-the-next-game-from-suda-51-and-grasshopper/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Romeo is a Dead Man has been revealed as the next game from Grasshopper Manufacture, Suda51 and Ben Yamazaki.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romeo is a Dead Man - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game starts out weird, and just continues to get weirder. Answering the door and getting absolutely blasted in the face, Romeo’s life is saved by his pal shoving the Dead Gear Life Support System into his eye… and turning him all cyborg-y.</p>
<p>What happens next is Romeo Stargazer going on a journey across spacetime, tracking down wanted criminals and turning them into a bloody mess using a mixture of swords and guns.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PS5, and we’ll note other platforms as and when they are confirmed.</p>

<p>Suda51’s last game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a>, of which Nick said, “No More Heroes 3 shines with its fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, zany characters and stunningly slick combat. It’s not afraid to be what it is, Suda 51 and his team delivering a great instalment to the franchise that welcomes us to the Garden of Insanity.”</p>

The game was first meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. Anyway, here is a brand new trailer featuring the little girl who we now know is an android called DI02367 or Diana for short, who wields a big gun.</p><div>
<p>We’re still pretty much none-the-wiser what Pragmata is really all about, but that naturally adds to its allure. We do know it will be an action adventure game that mixes in some strategy too. We will have to wait until later to really know what Pragmata is all about.</p>

			<p>After a few years of silence and over five years since its original reveal, CAPCOM's Pragmata was shown in action today with a brand new trailer, which also confirmed its release window.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdDVyBtYrUI">The new trailer</a>, captured on PlayStation 5 Pro and shown during today's State of Play presentation, provided a new look at the gameplay, which seems to seamlessly combine traversal challenges, puzzles,&nbsp;and intense third-person shooter combat. The trailer also provided a new look at the mysterious powers Diana will be able to use during the adventure to help players overcome the many challenges ahead of them. At the end of the trailer, it's also confirmed that Pragmata will finally launch sometime next year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata - First Contact Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, Pragmata was announced back in 2020, and the long silence made many suspect the game's development had ceased at some point. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/">2023</a>, CAPCOM confirmed that the game was still in the works, but a release date couldn't be confirmed as the developer needed more time to make the best game they could. Now that the release window has been set, it won't take much longer to learn more about the game.</p>
<p>Pragmata launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X , and Xbox Series S.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simple Yet Deep</strong> – <em>Lumines Arise</em> is easy to pick up and play, but has incredible depth that’s harder to master. Players manipulate 2×2 blocks of two colors that fall from the top of the screen, aiming to create Squares of a single color / type. A Timeline sweeps across the playfield to the beat of the music, clearing completed Squares and generating points.</li><li><strong>Embark on a Journey</strong> – Every stop on the over 30-stage single-player journey evokes a different and complex emotional response. From lush jungles, oceans teeming with life and snakes preparing to strike, to more electronic frontiers like the bustling streets of Tokyo and the endless expanse of outer space.</li><li><strong>Ready to Burst</strong> – Trigger the new Burst mechanic to stop a matched Square from clearing. Build it as large as you can until time runs out. When the Timeline starts clearing again, enjoy the show as screen-clearing combos rack up massive points.</li><li><strong>Express Yourself</strong> – Customize your player avatar from the largest selection of options the series has ever offered. It’s a great way to express yourself and your personality when setting off on your in-game journey.</li><li><strong>Plug In, Vibe Out</strong> – Let the electrifying soundtrack by Hydelic, acclaimed composer of <em>Tetris Effect: Connected</em> and <em><a title="Games > Rez Infinite [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez Infinite</a></em>‘s Area X, take you to new depths of immersion. You’ll want to throw on a pair of your favorite headphones for maximum effectiveness. Use the Playlist feature to create a mix of stages with your favorite tracks or to set a specific mood.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And here is more, via director Takashi Ishihara on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/lumines-arise-bursts-onto-playstation-5-this-fall/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Embark on a Journey Paved With Sound and Light</strong></p><p>Lumines Arise on PlayStation 5 with optional <a title="Platforms > PS VR [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr">PS VR</a>2 compatibility is more than just an ordinary puzzle game—our aim is to hit you right in the feels. You emerge from the darkness in the first stage (a glimpse of which you saw in today’s announcement trailer), and every stop on the over 30-stage journey evokes a different and complex emotional response. From lush jungles, oceans teeming with life, and snakes preparing to strike, to more electronic frontiers like the bustling streets of Tokyo and the endless expanse of outer space. All with visual flourishes to incite synesthesia.</p><p><strong>Simple Mechanic, Surprising Depth</strong></p><p>It all starts with a seemingly simple puzzle mechanic. If you’ve never played a Lumines game before, here’s how it works: rotate and place a variety of 2×2 blocks made up of one or two colors, forming squares of a single color/pattern. The Timeline sweeps across the playfield to the beat of the thumping soundtrack, erasing completed squares in its path. That gives you a light time pressure to form squares and build on them, making bigger and bigger squares to clear combos and score even more points.</p><p>You race to create combos, ever mindful of the constant movement of the Timeline, feeling the vibration of the DualSense controller while the music radiates between your ears and the vibrant, lively background draws you in. That’s when you enter a flow state, and the world around you vanishes. Your pulse quickens as your breath holds still.</p><p><strong>Introducing Burst</strong></p><p>Now, to amp things up! We’re introducing a brand-new feature to Lumines’ core gameplay: Burst. As you play, you charge up a gauge, shown at the top of the Timeline. When ready, tap a trigger button to activate Burst and lock a formed square to the playfield. Build it as large as you can before time runs out. Watch screen-clearing combos rack up massive points when Burst is complete and the Timeline starts clearing that color again. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r enough squares to meet the stage’s quota, and you’ll zoom to the next environment.</p><p>Avatars are making a comeback, too. Customize your own from the largest catalog of designs in the series ever, and we’re adding more as we go, so stay tuned for updates. It’s the perfect way to express yourself and your personality when setting off on your in-game journey.</p><p><strong>Music to Your Ears… and Eyes</strong></p><p>In the announcement trailer, you got a taste of Lumines Arise’s phenomenal new soundtrack. If you like that, check out the single of “Only Human” on Bandcamp (coming to other streaming services soon) for a closer listen. Arise features brand-new music composed by Hydelic, who was also responsible for Tetris Effect: Connected’s award-winning score. And just as with Connected, everything you do in-game impacts the soundscape.</p><p><strong>More to Come in the Future</strong></p><p>Stay tuned for information about a demo coming later this Summer that you might even want to play with friends. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Lumines Arise Announce Trailer | PS5, Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHUWdasJYrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>MindsEye isn't out today; it's out in less than a week on June 10, 2025. But, as has always happened since the dawn of any physical media release, some stores have sold physical copies of the game to customers <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930246058543612186">ahead of the release date</a>.</p>
<p>Which means that MindsEye is already out there, and those lucky enough to get their hands on it, like X user <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930233857762103726">MrHazel88</a>, will be able to see what Build a Rocket Boy has been cooking this whole time, and post about what he sees, likely share some gameplay, unencumbered by any embargo agreements or NDA's. They claim they'll only post about <a href="https://x.com/MrHazel88/status/1930246377193251217">how the game runs and avoid spoilers</a>, but they're <a href="https://x.com/gflaxko/status/1930323742363648213">not the only ones who seem to have an early copy</a>.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy is aware that physical copies have been sold early and <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1930332247225225473">has released a statement warning players that copies are already out there.</a> The studio asked players not to post any narrative spoilers, and also pointed out that the game will be without its day-one patch, almost like it was warning them about what they'd be playing sans that patch.</p>
<p>"<em>We want to highlight that a major update for physical copies will be coming at release, bringing key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-positive previews</a> and the news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two of Build a Rocket Boy's chief executives left the studio</a> a week before MindsEye is due to launch, there's an odd air around the game. Copies getting out early, ahead of how Build a Rocket Boy intended them to be experienced, is the latest odd and unfortunate event in the game's journey.</p>
<p>We'll hear and see more about it in just a couple of days with <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-has-announced-its-first-ioi-showcase-for-this-friday-will-feature-007-first-light-mindseye-and-hitman/">Friday's IOI Showcase</a>, and a few days after that, it'll be out, so who knows how it'll register with players once it is properly out the door, day-one patch installed. It could be the next-best game of 2025, for all we know at this point. Or not.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for being part of this journey with us, truly. We can't wait for you to experience MindsEye at launch and explore the main campaign and game creation system we've crafted for you, which delivers an endless stream of engaging new content monthly,</em>" the studio wrote at the end of its statement.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite - Galactic Battle Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>An AI-powered version of Darth Vader was added to Fortnite and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-star-wars-event-start-time-and-how-to-play-death-star-sabotage/1100-6532002/" data-ref-id="1100-6532002">Star Wars-themed season</a> late last month. The NPC, complete with a Google-developed AI model trained on voice clips recorded by James Earl Jones, could actively respond to player comments and commands. This involved the character recounting its history in the Star Wars universe, commenting on in-game mechanics, and making some of the most inappropriate and offensive comments you could imagine.</p><p>Online compilations of this version of Darth Vader cussing and making sexual comments spread across the internet quickly before Epic Games patched the NPC, limiting what sort of comments it could make. Vader will be live within Fortnite until the end of the current season on June 7.</p><p>AI is one of the hottest topics in the games and tech industries currently. Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-makes-a-bold-claim-about-ai-in-video-games/1100-6532073/" data-ref-id="1100-6532073">CEO Tim Sweeney said</a> that AI will be able to build games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild within the next few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-switch-2s-finally-fixed-its-predecessors-painfully-sluggish-eshop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is finally getting into the public's hands, meaning answers for all sorts of previously unanswered questions are beginning to emerge as the system gets a thorough go-over. And, if you were wondering, it looks like one of the original Switch's most exasperating features - its horribly sluggish eShop experience - has now been resolved with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Switch's eShop was, of course, a notoriously exhausting experience; it was terribly organised, overflowing with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-game-furry-hentai-tangram-raises-eyebrows-and-questions-over-whats-allowed-on-switch">boobily provocative shovelware</a>, and above all else, <em>slow</em>. Switching between store sections could cause the eShop to hang, while scrolling though the 2,000+ titles perpetually on sale would inevitably prove so traumatic for the system it would squeal and force a full page reload. In fact, the experience was so poor on-machine, it was almost always easier to shop via Nintendo's website version.
</p>
<p>
With Switch 2, however, it looks like significant performance improvements have arrived. We already had some inkling this would be the case, of course; a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-1/">recent interview</a> with Nintendo's Switch 2 development team highlighted a variety of promised eShop upgrades, including assurance it now "runs smoothly". And footage now circulating following today's Switch 2 release in certain timezones suggests that's very much the case.
</p>
<p>
VGC, for instance, has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/get-your-first-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-eshop/">uploaded four and a half minutes of red-hot Switch 2 eShop action</a>. That's 270 seconds of pure, unadulterated storefront browsing, so you might want to steel yourself before clicking 'play'. The main takeaway, though, is that this thing flies on Switch 2, with barely a hiccup or hitch to be seen. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry also brought encouraging word based on his own (admittedly fairly unscientific) eShop explorations. "It's almost instant," he declared when asked about loading times.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Five paragraphs on Switch 2's digital storefront running faster! And if it's more of that you want, you'll be able to smoothly scroll yourself into an erotic frenzy when Nintendo's latest console arrives tomorrow, 5th June. We'll be taking a bit of time before we deliver our final verdict on the machine, but until then, why not check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">review of Nintendo's <em>other</em> controversial, expensive handheld</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/its-here-unboxing-and-setting-up-our-switch-2-review-unit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Once I brought the original Switch close by to start the transfer process, I was warned that save files for games including <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu</em> would be removed from the original system during transfer, presumably as an anti-cheating measure. This made the whole process a bit nerve-wracking, though in the end my save files made it through with flying colors.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>Switch 2 cartridges look remarkably similar to original Switch cartridges (and seem to fit just fine in the original Switch, but throws up an error if you try to play).</span>

<p>Surprisingly, the wireless system transfer process also wouldn't move screenshots and gameplay videos stored on the original Switch. To move those over, I had to remove the physical microSD card from the Switch and temporarily insert it into the Switch 2. This was particularly perplexing since the Switch 2 seems to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">only officially support MicroSD Express cards</a> for everything but this one setup feature.</p>

<h2>Bigger than a breadbox</h2>


<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">talked before</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">the relative size of the Switch 2</a> compared to other portable game consoles like the original Switch and the Steam Deck. Still, there's something about seeing the hardware next to an original Game Boy or even a PlayStation Portable that really highlights how far handheld gaming hardware design has come in the last few decades.</p>
<p>Holding a retail Switch 2 unit in our hands also reconfirms <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">what we said during our April preview of the hardware</a>; namely, the unit feels a bit more substantial in the hand than the original Switch, but still a good deal less bulky than portable PCs like the Steam Deck, both in terms of weight and overall thickness. While it's still early, we'd expect long-term portable play to be plenty comfortable here.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>From top: Switch 2, Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go S. It's hard to tell from here, but the Switch 2 is a lot lighter and thinner.</span>
                    <span>
                      Kyle Orland
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>On the control side, while the buttons and sticks on the Switch 2 are a little better suited to adult hands than those on the original Switch, they still feel a little on the small side when held right next to standard console controllers from Sony and Microsoft. That's not true of the Pro Controller 2, though, which will feel immediately familiar in size and shape to anyone who's played on a PlayStation or Xbox console in recent years.</p>
<p>We'll have much more to say about our experience with the Switch 2 in the coming days and weeks. For now, leave us a comment if you have any specific questions that we might be able to answer as we put the console through its paces.</p>

While one might assume Switch 2 preorders to arrive on launch day, June 5, one look at social media shows that is far from the case. There is frustration from those with Switch 2 preorders who have had their preorders canceled last minute. Others are dealing with vague arrival times that makes it unclear if it will arrive on launch day or some time later. Some have preorders that are set to arrive almost a week later, adding to the confusion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Among those of us here at GameSpot, there are at least two people who preordered at Target who apparently won't get their Switch 2 orders until June 11. Another who ordered from Walmart is set to have theirs delivered by launch day, but the exact timing is unclear, with Walmart stating it will arrive before 10 PM despite previous guarantees of delivery by 9 AM. </p><p dir="ltr">People who preordered from Walmart seem to have it especially bad, with reports on <a href="https://x.com/Havoc_C/status/1930286834833125404" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> of canceled preorders at the last minute related to payment issues, despite many users <a href="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claiming</a> to have double checked their payment info and confirmed with customer service representatives that their order was secure.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">walmart you have failed me for canceling my switch 2 preorder when my payment method is valid and has funds available, give it back <a href="https://t.co/cmUFUL56TA" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cmUFUL56TA</a></p>  — Bumbles (@Bumbles1593) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Even those who preordered directly from Nintendo aren't safe, as Nintendo makes clear on its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> that those who signed up to preorder directly from the My Nintendo Store might not receive the chance to purchase a Switch 2 ahead of launch day. Those who did secure preorders may receive their Switch 2 on June 5, but Nintendo makes clear there's no guarantee.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a familiar feeling to that of April 24, when Switch 2 preorders first went live and would-be Switch 2 owners had to endure disappearing orders, overloaded websites, and virtual queues that went nowhere. The entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">Switch 2 preorder process was a chaotic mess</a>, with potential buyers waiting for close to two hours, all the while unclear if waiting in a digital line was doing them any good or if their preorders would suddenly vanish into thin air.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all the technical difficulties and confusion, it's clear demand for Nintendo's new console is extremely high. It is, after all, not every day a new Nintendo console arrives, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">Switch 2-exclusive games</a> like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> will be the kind of game players keep coming back to for years to come. Some retailers will have limited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 stock to sell on launch day</a>, and people are already lining up outside stores for a chance to secure one.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the Switch 2 is more widely available this will all be a distant memory (or nightmare), but for now, it's mostly just disappointing how frustrating and confusing the entire process has been. For those waiting to see if their preorder arrives on time (or at all), good luck. We're all going to need it.</p>

                <p>June is full of celebrations, including Pride Month, Men's Health Month, ALS Awareness Month, and Black Music Month, and now one more can be added to the list: Video Game Month. Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow officially proclaimed June as Video Game Month in Toronto earlier this week, celebrating video games, but also the proud Canadian studios and developers.</p><p>Starting June 7, the city will hold <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/video-game-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 40 events</a>, ranging from high-profile esports competitions and professional summits to indie game spotlights and showcases. Many events are free and open to the public, where citizens can explore, play, and connect with Toronto's gaming and digital landscape.</p><p>"Toronto's gaming industry reflects the best of our city. It is creative, diverse, and forward-thinking," Chow said in a <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/news/mayor-olivia-chow-proclaims-june-as-video-game-month-launches-month-long-celebration-of-gaming-innovation-and-creativity/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Video Game Month is an invitation to celebrate this growing sector and the talented people behind it and to discover how gaming connects with art, innovation, and our local communities."</p><p>Taking a quick look at the events across the city, you'll find Riot Games hosting a Valorant Masters event from June 7-22. According to the city, the event will have art activations and charity drives that are expected to attract more than 20,000 attendees and create $40 million in economic impact.</p><p>There's also Toronto Games Week (June 12 to June 18), which will be a citywide indie games celebration with live action role-playing games, workshops, talks, and exhibits.</p><p>Video Game Month was founded in part to align with two other of the city's economic initiatives to "promote innovation and quality jobs, and celebrate Toronto's diverse creative industrial environment." </p><p>June is already a big month for gaming generally, with the launch of Switch 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> (and its adjacent events) happening. This is the first month-long celebration for video games, with March 10 being Mario Day and February 2 also called Hedgehog Day for all things Sonic.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> XDefiant - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey," executive producer Mark Rubin wrote in the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1864092633561481249" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>. "Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It's a long journey that Ubisoft and the team's working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue."</p><p>XDefiant attempted to buck a trend that many other online multiplayer games followed by ditching SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) in favor of what Rubin called the "old school arcade shooter" experience. The experiment, which launched in May 2024, was not successful as the shooter barely lasted six months before its publisher began the process of shutting it down.</p><p>Half the XDefiant team has been transitioning to "other roles within Ubisoft" since that original announcement in December. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, a "skeleton crew" was kept on to run XDefiant until its servers shut down this week. 300 people at Ubisoft were impacted by layoffs following the decision by Ubisoft to shutter XDefiant.</p>

Pieces stand up to 4 inches tall and feature the same blocky proportions as found in the game, with each piece constructed to look like marbled stone or obsidian. The board can be separated into four pieces for easy storage, so it won’t take up much space in your treasure chest when not in use.</span></p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506880-f63b84ec-f47f-4aa4-aa84-50cba3db%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506880" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506880-f63b84ec-f47f-4aa4-aa84-50cba3db%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506880"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Chess Set</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506880-f63b84ec-f47f-4aa4-aa84-50cba3db%281%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506881-71rd9exflul._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506882-61amylqpoel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506883-71w4-ifnkal._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506881,1300-4506882,1300-4506883" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4506881-71rd9exflul._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4506882-61amylqpoel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4506883-71w4-ifnkal._ac_sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506881-71rd9exflul._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506882-61amylqpoel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4506883-71w4-ifnkal._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>A Minecraft Movie is heading to home theaters this month, with an assortment of Blu-rays releasing on June 24.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is almost upon us (and in some territories, <em>actually</em> upon us), and with its arrival comes Nintendo's much-touted day one update. We already knew it was an important one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">unlocking a significant amount of the console's basic functionality</a>, but Nintendo's patch notes make it clear you won't be doing much of anything right out of the box on launch day without it.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/system-update-information-for-nintendo-switch-2/">20.1.1 patch</a> is available to download now (not especially useful in the UK at the moment, of course), and opens up a whole raft of fairly fundamental features you otherwise won't have access to, including the ability to play a substantial number of games.
</p>
<p>
Once installed, your inert electronic Nintendo lump will be positively transformed, now capable of running Switch software, accessing Switch Online features including Game Chat, opening Nintendo's eShop, and more. Notably, the update is also required to use MicroSD Express cards and to run <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Switch 2 software shipped on game-key cards</a> - which seems to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">vast majority of third-party physical releases</a> right now.
</p>
<p>
You'll be prompted to install the update as part of Switch 2's set-up process, otherwise you'll later see the prompt when trying to access any of the features it's used for. Nintendo hasn't explicitly revealed its download size, but early word suggests it's pretty svelt - you might just be able to fit in a cuppa while you wait, though, if you turn the kettle on quick. Patch notes!
</p>
<p><em><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Version 20.1.1</h3>
<p>The following features have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of compatible Nintendo Switch software</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Online</li>
<li>GameChat</li>
<li>GameShare</li>
<li>System transfer from Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Virtual game cards</li>
<li>Nintendo eShop</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Upload of screenshots and videos to the server - Nintendo Switch App on a smart device is needed to view and download screenshots and videos uploaded to the server</li>
<li>Link with the smart device apps Nintendo Switch Parental Controls and Nintendo Switch App</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch App on a smart device is needed to view and download screenshots and videos uploaded to the server</li>
<li>Linking to a Nintendo Account is required for network features, with some exceptions.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use Nintendo Switch 2 game-key cards.</li>
<li>Updating to version 20.1.1 is required to use a microSD Express card.</li>
</ul></em></p><p>

Will Switch 2's 20.1.1 update turn Nintendo's latest console into a must-have machine? It'll be a little while before Eurogamer's ready to share our final verdict, but you can at least read our review of Nintendo's <em>other</em> controversial, expensive handheld until then. As for the machine's launch day games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">Mario Kart World left Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wondering if there might be more to see</a> after some underwhelming first impressions, while Welcome Tour, conversely, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">proven to be an unexpectedly welcome surprise</a>. Even if it does cost £8.

		<p>Developer METROPOLICE has announced a brand new city builder called The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, where you become the Governor of Hell. You are in charge of putting together your own version of the punishment focused underworld, sorting out the souls that find themselves there while also trying to work out all of the secrets of Hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="new trailer 6" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQdvpF1xjbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Our goal with The HELL: City Builder of the Dead is to bring a fresh perspective to the city-builder genre—by exploring a theme that’s rarely touched,”</em> said Mike Chong, Founder of METROPOLICE. <em>“This is our imagination at play. Players step into the role of a Hell Governor, managing a dark, chaotic vision of the afterlife that also has a giant Titan lurking around the map that the player needs to defeat to advance.”</em></p>
<p>In The Hell: City Builder of the Dead, you will need to manage a delicate balance by managing the arrivals. Fail to do so and these sinners may attempt to cause chaos to destroy everything. In addition to the sinners, there are the Titans that rule each of the realms of Hell. Each of the Titans is inspired by various mythologies and to fully uncover the secrets of Hell you will need to defeat the Titans.</p>

<p>The Hell: City Builder of the Dead will enter Steam Early Access on Friday, October 24, 2025.</p>
