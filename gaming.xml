			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch is now live on PC, addressing some crashing issues and a few other issues.</p>
<p>The 1.1.3 patch, which has been confirmed to be the last patch of the year for the game, is considerably smaller than the previous patch in both size and scope. Weighting around 7.4 GB, the patch focuses on fixing a small selection of issues, introducing a temporary solution to avoid crashes on shader compilation by skipping shaders warm up, as well as addressing a few access violation error crashes, an issue when invert axis options could not be saved after restarting the game and another issue where controls could be lost after shooting, reloading and then examing the artifact. The detailed patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525330030617690996?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new STALKER 2 patch is much smaller in scope than the previous one, which addressed over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/">1800 issues</a>, improved the A-Life system, and improved optimization, among other things. Performance was also improved on RTX 3000 series cards with AMD frame generation, although the minor improvements show how there's still plenty of work to be done in this regard.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC World by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

Check out the patch notes, below, for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feybreak arrives as developer Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. However, without explanation, Pocketpair recently tweaked how players summon Pals, with observers speculating the change had to do with the patent infringement lawsuit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5, albeit after a short delay in Japan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on the lawsuit to see who will emerge victorious, if it isn't settled first. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, however, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Pocketpair has continued to release major updates for Palworld and Feybreak is just the latest example of that. The developer is even moving forward with crossovers with other huge video games, including the start of a Terraria collaboration with today's release of Feybreak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld Feybreak update 0.4.11 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>▼New Content<br>・Meowmere from Terraria!<br>⤷ Meowmere, the first "bullet-firing melee weapon" in Palworld, has been added.

            <p>
Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s female V are both set to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
The crossover is expected to go live tonight, with the characters and various accessories available to buy in the game's shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games confirmed the crossover and showed off the appearance of the characters within Fortnite yesterday, in a post on social media that teased: "We're expecting some guests from Night City."

<p>
It's perhaps not surprising to see Cyberpunk 2077 turn up in Fortnite - its developer CD Projekt Red has forged close ties with Epic Games through its switch to Unreal Engine for future development (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">first trailer for The Witcher 4</a>, and our first look at The Witcher's world in Unreal, debuted this month at The Game Awards). And the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-4-starts-tomorrow-with-geralt-and-doomslayer">Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri all joined Fortnite previously</a>.
</p><p>
Fun fact: this will be Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite, after his previous addition as John Wick. But he's not the first actor to get into the game twice. Zendaya (in her Spider-Man and Dune guises) and Harrison Ford (as both Han Solo and Indiana Jones) have also previously found their way into Fortnite more than once.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest additions come amidst a typically-busy end of year season for the game. Its Winterfest event is now on offering daily free cosmetic rewards (leading up to a Santa Snoop Dogg skin on Christmas day), heralded by the in-game arrival of Mariah Carey from a giant block of ice. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-and-plungerman-plop-into-fortnite">Skibidi Toilet is now in the game too</a>.

        <p>Key members of original dev team say they were ready and willing to make a sequel.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA reportedly rejected proposals to create a brand new Dead Space game.</p>
<p>Glen Schofield - who directed the original game and went on to co-found both Sledgehammer Games and Callisto Protocol studio, Striking Distance - said that EA shut down a proposal for "Dead Space 4", saying it wasn't "interested right now".</p>
<p>The news follows EA's launch of the critically-acclaimed Dead Space Remake in January 2023, but uncertainty over the franchise's future.</p>

<p>"We tried actually, you know, the three of us. We tried Dead Space 4," Schofield said in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/cU5PrEr1HjM?t=5480">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, alongside his former colleagues, creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. "We're talking this year."</p><p>"We didn't go too deep.

They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so..."</p>
<p>"All three of us sat down and wanted to do it," Stone added. "The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you've got to take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've got some ideas," Schofield teased.</p>
<p>When asked by Allen if they'd really return to the horror series, Stone said: "I'd make a Dead Space 4," and Schofield simply said: "Yes."</p>
<p>When Bret Robbins didn't say anything, Schofield pointed out that Robbins had "a good game going" given he was "having a great time" working with Dan Houser at Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, rumours swirled that despite the Dead Space Remake's critical acclaim, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-series-reportedly-on-ice-following-sequel-remake-rumours">whole series was reportedly "on ice"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Dead Space 4 game is something fans have been yearning for ever since the third mainline installment was released over ten years ago. Of course, the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017 while they were making the Star Wars project codenamed Ragtag threw a big wrench into those plans, but the remake of the first game released by Motive Studios in early 2023 certainly rekindled hopes - at least until the sales, despite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid critical reception</a>, turned out to be too low, and publisher EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to put the IP back on the shelf.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming</a>, three of the original franchise creators (Bret Robbins, Glen Schofield, and Christopher Stone) revealed that they actually pitched Dead Space 4 to Electronic Arts in 2024. Needless to say, they weren't successful.</p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> We tried, actually, you know, the three of us, for Dead Space 4. I mean, we're talking this year. We didn't go too deep; they just said we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah. We know who to talk to, so we didn't go and take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so yeah.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Christopher Stone:</strong> The industry is in a weird place right now, and people are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you got to, you know, take it with a grain of salt. Who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do Dead Space 4.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Glen Schofield:</strong> Yeah. We got some ideas.</em></p>
<p>It is likely that they pitched it too soon to Electronic Arts following the unsuccessful release of the remake. The trio tried anyway because they were all free at the time, following their own games that didn't go as well as planned. Bret Robbins was the founder of Ascendant Studios and Game Director on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, which flopped hard, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive layoffs at the studio</a>. Glen Schofield and Christopher Stone were Game Director and Chief Creative Officer at Striking Distance Studios on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Callisto Protocol</a>, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly unsuccessful compared to its budget</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all three have new jobs. This September, Bret Robbins joined Absurd Ventures, the new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created</a> in 2021 by Rockstar's Dan Houser, as Game Director on an unannounced project. Christopher Stone became Studio General Manager of VOID Interactive, the developer behind the tactical FPS game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready or Not</a>, in August. And Schofield? Here's what he said in the video interview:</p>
<p><em>I have been working on a smaller project. We're trying to get funding right now. It's a pretty exciting project. It's smaller, and I'm not directing; I'm going to be executive producing it.&nbsp;When you hear what it's about, if we get the funding, you'll understand. It's something kind of special for me.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like it will be some time before the trio are ready to pitch Dead Space 4 again. Fans might want to prepare for a long wait, but at least they still intend to make it at some point - EA willing, of course.</p>

<p>VALORANT coach Christine “potter” Chi has signed a three-year contract extension with Evil Geniuses. With the deal signed, potter will be under contract with Evil Geniuses through at least the 2027 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses has officially completed its roster in the final days of 2024, gearing up for the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season in the Americas league.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evil-geniuses-seek-return-to-championship-glory">Evil Geniuses Seek Return to Championship Glory</h2>



<p>Potter signed a three-year, “max-length” contract with Evil Geniuses through 2027. The only other coach in VCT Americas with a contract through 2027, per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRmmWiBmMMD43m5VtZq54nKlmj0ZtythsA1qCpegwx-iRptx2HEsG0T3cQlG1r2AIiKxBWnaurJZQ9Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Global Contract Database</a>, is 100 Thieves’ Anthony “Zikz” Gray. Zikz, a long-time coach in League of Legends who switched to VALORANT, was potter’s assistant coach during EG’s unexpected world championship run in 2023. The assistant coach for EG last year, Mike “pho” Panza, has also returned for the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses CEO Chris DeAppolonio, in a press release today, called potter the “lynchpin” of EG’s VALORANT program, . “There’s no one else I’d want at the helm. With Potter’s leadership and passion, EG will always contend for the VALORANT World Championship.”</p>



<p>The re-signing of potter completes EG’s offseason ahead of the start of the 2025 season. The team opted to re-sign returning players Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/">Two new additions in Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange</a> were announced Friday. Excluding icy, who was on the team’s reserve roster at the time, potter is the only remaining name from the 2023 Champions roster.</p>



<p>The full field of 12 teams in VCT Americas all made changes to their starting rosters during this offseason period.</p>



<p>How do you think potter and Evil Geniuses stack up against other VALORANT teams heading into VCT 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The game has already picked up over 20 million players and shows no signs of stopping. Which is cool but also very surprising!</p><p>I think I speak for many of us when I ask: Weren’t we done with hero shooters? After the market was saturated with them and <em>Overwatch 2</em> turned out to be a slow-moving train wreck, it felt like the trend of having a colorful roster of heroes shoot each other over moving a payload was done. <em>Concord</em>, Sony’s failed hero shooter, seemed to really cement that when it launched and died in just about 4 weeks earlier this year. And yet, here we all are playing and loving <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, a free-to-play hero shooter with a big roster and plenty of payloads to move. Life is funny sometimes, huh?</p><p>Because <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is such a big hit, with many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> playing it, we’ve also been thinking about it a lot and writing up guides, stories, and other posts about it. So here’s everything we’ve written about <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2024 in one handy-dandy location.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is the hottest new thing in the realm of hero shooters. And, it has launched with over 30 popular characters from the Marvel universe.

So, if you’re new to the game (or even hero shooters in general), here are three characters that are easy to pick up and play. — Billy Givens</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is out now and free to play on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5.

            <p>Just 15 percent of Steam players spent time with new releases - defined as games released in 2024 - this year.</p>
<p>That's according to Steam itself, which gave us a little insight into the broader playing habits of its players as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/641297020996289523">Steam Replay 2024</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the recap not only shows you how many games you played and when, but also your favourite genres, the achievements you unlocked (the median was 13), the number of games played (for most, this is four), and your longest streak (the average was six days, apparently).</p>
<p>"How many games did you play, and how does that compare to last year? Did you unlock a bunch of achievements? What about your longest streak? These fun numbers and more are in your Replay," Valve teases.</p>
<p>You also get the chance to be humbled by the amount of time you spent with your most-played games of 2024, as well as a quick recap of any playtests you participated in, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-antitrust-lawsuit-expands-to-include-anyone-who-has-paid-a-commission-to-valve-since-2017">A 2021 antitrust dispute brought against Steam has now been expanded into a class action lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the case concerned just two companies - Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios - but a court document recently showed the motion for class certification has been approved. This means the lawsuit now applies to "any developers, publishers, or individuals" who have honoured Steam's 30 percent cut on any and all purchases on or after 28th January 2017.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
