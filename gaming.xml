<p>Star Wars: Hunters developers have officially confirmed that the game is being shut down this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Star Wars Hunters’ online servers will be shut down on October 1, 2025, which is the last day the game will be playable. The final content update will arrive on April 15, 2025. The developers have also stated that the decision to shut down the game “was not made lightly” and that they are “committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about sunsetting Star Wars: Hunters reveals additional information about upcoming updates. On March 25, players will observe that Season 5 will receive a 3-week extension. The developers will “re-run events and shop bundles from the Season” during this time. The ranked season will also receive an extension, providing players more time to hit Kyber 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final content update for Star Wars Hunters will arrive on April 15. The free update will also disable in-game purchases across all platforms. The April update also adds a new Support Hunter, Tuya. The character will be playable immediately when it arrives and at no cost. Additional in-game content will be released during this update, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, on October 1, 2025, the online servers for Star Wars Hunters will be officially shut down, and the game will no longer be accessible.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced that it's making a game for Sony Interactive Entertainment based on an IP that Sony owns, though it remains to be seen what the game is.</p><p>In a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, People Can Fly said the new game is in the works under the codename Project Delta. As part of the agreement between People Can Fly and Sony, <span>there will be a milestone process. Details weren't provided, but this is a common practice where development progress is reviewed at certain intervals.</span></p><p>People Can Fly did not divulge the specific scope and terms of its milestone agreement with Sony but said it does not differ much from standard work-for-hire projects of this nature. The Polish studio has a lot of experience in this department, as it has worked with big game companies on projects before, including Gears of War: Judgment with Microsoft, Fortnite: Saves the World with Epic, and Outriders with Square Enix. People Can Fly is also working with PUBG company Krafton on a new game codenamed <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">collaborating with The Coalition on Gears of War: E-Day. </a></p><p>The official word is that People Can Fly's game with Sony is "based on the intellectual property rights owned by" Sony, but there is no word on what it is. It sounds like it could be an existing Sony franchise, but that is never stated outright in the document. Another document from People Can Fly describes the agreement as<a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-3-2025-commencement-of-negotiations-with-sony-disclosure-of-delayed-inside-information-final.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> covering work to create a prototype</a>.</p><p>Founded in 2002, People Can Fly released the first-person shooter Painkiller in 2004 as its first game. Epic Games took a majority ownership of the company in 2007 following the cancellation of People Can Fly's game Come Midnight with now-defunct publisher THQ. In 2012, Epic bought People Can Fly and re-named it Epic Games Poland, but in 2015, People Can Fly became independent again.</p>

However, the Starfield Creation Kit hub <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not allow players to choose "PlayStation" as a platform in the filter</a>, despite the logo appearing on one of the mod's pages.</p><p>It's possible to<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=PS&amp;sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> tweak the URL</a> to force the filter to show mods listed for PlayStation. For a period of time today, March 14, this displayed one result for the mod listed for PlayStation. However, it has since been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675" data-ratio="0.52787663107948" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675"></a><figcaption>A PlayStation listing sits alongside Xbox and PC platforms for a Starfield mod.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png"></figure><p>It's possible this whole thing was an error and that it doesn't signal any kind of forthcoming announcement from Bethesda.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm that Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console. He said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">"No,"</a> going on to state that he sees no reason to ever "put a ring fence around any game" and say it could never come to a platform where it could find an audience and bring in money for Microsoft. </p><p>Starfield coming to PS5 would fit within Xbox's strategy of bringing more games to PlayStation. However, the wait for Starfield to come to PS5 has been lengthier compared to some of the other Xbox games that eventually came to PS5.</p><p>Starfield launched in September 2023 and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-passes-15-million-players-as-game-adds-new-vehicle-and-quest/1100-6527873/#:~:text=Starfield%20has%20crossed%20a%20new,quest%2C%20fixes%2C%20and%20more." data-ref-id="1100-6527873">reached more than 15 million players.</a> Bethesda recently acknowledged that fans are eager for updates, adding that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"hard at work" on new content</a>, but it's too soon to reveal anything. "We have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right," Bethesda said.</p>

            <p>I don't much enjoy sports sims, but sometimes an imaginative spin on a sport will sneak past my guard. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/electro-bop-boxing-league">Electro Bop Boxing League</a> has spins aplenty. You probably could have stopped at robot boxers, Developer Dob. You didn't have to give it a swaggering electro swing soundtrack as well. Special moves depicted as old-timey computer punched cards? Soldering limbs back on between rounds with a Repair-o-Gun? Little eggheads in lab coats clinging to the back of my gymrat C3PO as he pounds some would-be Megatron to shrapnel? Referee counts presented as a rebooting sequence? Developer Dob, you are spoiling us!</p><!--more-->

<p>There's a demo you can play and I suggest you play it, rather than endure my attempts to riff on boxing terminology. I'll keep this write-up brief. Electro Bop Boxing League is a musical autobattler with a decent dollop of micromanagement and some joyful atompunk presentation. </p>
<p>The opening hurdle that might turn away a few players is that the majority of commands have to be entered on the beat. This includes: completing the button combos for those punchcards; massaging your various gauges to keep your robot mobile, dukes up, and running at an optimal temperature; and button-bashing your way out of a clutch (here represented as a tug-of-war over which robot gets zapped by the other side's accumulated static electricity).</p>
<p>The whole world and HUD twitches and jiggles to the score, helping you nail the prompts, but still, I found this exasperating in the demo - until I realised that you don't have to match the tempo exactly and continuously. Just hitting the odd beat will do.</p>
<p>The robots are beautiful vintage creations - all Rock 'Em Sock 'Em elbows, caterpillar treads and lightbulb eyes. It feels like there's some decent depth of customisation here, too, though I wouldn't put this in the same league as Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon. The career mode sees you unlocking new parts, abilities and passive crew skills from daily manager events. You can also have tourists come view your budding George Forebot to earn some extra dosh, at the risk of them breaking something.</p>
<p>It's out... soon! April 18th, which is barely a month away. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3211280/Electro_Bop_Boxing_League/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/severance-ep-9-season-2-burt-irving-relationship-gay-1851770084<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we head into next week’s season finale, I’m starting to better understand the frustration some viewers feel with <em>Severance</em>’s pacing in its second season. We’re nine episodes in and not a lot has happened. There have been several character-driven episodes in a row and not much movement on the main mystery, and we’re one episode away from the show going on hiatus once more. Given the three-year gap between seasons one and two, I can understand the worry that we’re going to reach the end of this season without having learned that much. But the season’s penultimate episode, “The After Hours,” felt like a necessary bit of housecleaning so the show would be free to focus almost exclusively on its overarching mystery and how protagonists Mark (Adam Scott) and Helly (Britt Lower) are faring. That means we spent a lot of time with the rest of the ensemble, wrapping up numerous storylines with a series of devastating conclusions. I’m a bit bummed we didn’t get full episodes dedicated to these characters like the one Patricia Arquette’s Harmony Cobel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452">got last week</a></span>, but god, the conclusion of <em>Severance</em>’s slow burn old man love story between Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) has sent me on an ongoing emotional spiral I haven’t recovered from.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>How do the makers of <em>Severance </em>expect me to function after watching these two men get to the precipice of running away together and escaping Lumon’s clutches, just for Burt to emphatically and repeatedly tell Irving that they <em>can’t</em>? I’m getting ahead of myself. But the image of Irving and Burt’s outies standing forehead to forehead in a train station is burned into my brain. As for how we got here, it turns out that yes, fans’ theories that Burt’s outie was actually an undercover agent working for Lumon were correct. As he explains to Irving, he has been working with the corporation for many years, helping to disappear enemies of its interests. Now that both Irving’s innie and outie have been investigating the company’s corruption, the man who his innie fell in love with is in Burt’s crosshairs. He’s been given orders to deliver Irving somewhere to be discreetly dealt with, as he’s done to many of Lumon’s enemies over the years.</p><p>While I sympathize with those who feel that <em>Severance</em>’s greater mysteries have been moving a bit too slowly, I do wonder if some viewers have gotten so fixated on the question of what the main cast is doing on the severed floor that they’re losing sight of these micro mysteries which help build out the world through the lens of the people in it. In Episode 6, “Attila,” Burt, Irving, and Burt’s outie husband Fields all pontificated about whether or not innies and outies had distinct souls that could ascend to Heaven independent of what the other personality had done. People rightfully assumed Burt was working with Lumon, but what could he have done that would make him so sure he wouldn’t see the pearly gates that he’d bisect his brain in the hope that some part of him would reach Heaven while the other burned for eternity? It turns out that helping Lumon whisk away anyone who slighted it weighs on a person.</p><p>But now, he’s met with the person this innocent version of himself fell in love with, and he’s been ordered to drop him off somewhere for the company’s nefarious purposes. After years of following Lumon’s orders, he finally hesitates, and instead of dropping Irving off where he was told to, he takes him and his dog Radar to a train station, gives him a one-way ticket, and tells him not to say where he’s going. Burt can’t know where Irving’s stop is, because as long as he doesn’t, the man his innie fell in love with will be safe.</p><p>If that weren’t devastating enough on its own, Irving’s own confession had me curled up in the fetal position on the floor. Before he gets on the train, he tells Burt he’s never been loved before, not really. But at his old age of 60-something, it’s painful for him to know he felt it once and can’t remember it, and he wants Burt to give them a chance to feel that connection in this life. The scene mirrors one from season one, in which Burt and Irving’s innies decide they can’t engage in “fraternization,” and Irving says that he’s “not ready” to break Lumon’s rules. Seeing the roles reversed and Irving begging Burt to give them a chance to get on that train together and see where things go generates the kind of devastating angst you rarely find outside of AO3.</p><p>Irving says he wants to remember the love they felt for each other on the severed floor, but I imagine it would break his heart to know that version of him passed on the opportunity to love and be loved. In the end, all either version of Irving has is the image he’s formed in his mind of what a life with Burt could have looked like. <em>Severance </em>has always been for the yearners, but I can’t lie, I was hoping and praying for a shot of Burt walking up to Irving on the train and escaping Lumon’s clutches alongside his innie’s love. But it never came.</p><p>If this show had come out 10 years ago, the version of me I was then probably would have been miffed that the queer love story ended so tragically when <em>Severance </em>is about to release a season finale spotlighting its straight leads. But the longer I’ve lived, the more that queer love stories like Burt and Irving’s resonate with me, stories that capture the reality that most relationships don’t end well. Statistically, more of us deal with heartbreak from disinterested partners, meeting the right person at the wrong time, and finding we wasted a lot of hours being too scared to take the next step, than with happily ever after. The greatest, most passionate love stories often end with someone on a one-way trip to god knows where. I imagine we’ve seen the last of Irving in <em>Severance</em>, and it’s fitting that Burt was the one who ensured he got a second chance. Wherever he gets off that train, I hope he doesn’t waste the time he’s been given the way he did on the severed floor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> now less than a week away, Microsoft has announced it'll be the latest to title to join Xbox's steadily growing "Stream your own games" service.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insiders-can-now-play-select-games-they-own-on-their-console-using-cloud-streaming">launched the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play "select" games they already own via streaming</a> last November, some five years after announcing the feature was in the works. It's a service distinct from the ability to play Xbox Game Pass titles via streaming, and one that currently only supports a limited number of games.
</p>
<p>
At launch, 50 titles featured on Microsoft's "Steam your own games" list - including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - and that's since expanded to encompass more than 70 games. Ubisoft already has a big presence on the list (many of its more recent titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are on there), so it's perhaps not to surprising to hear Assassin's Creed Shadows is up next.

<p>
Microsoft announced Shadows' upcoming inclusion on Xbox's "Stream your own games" list in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xbox.com/post/3lkdwjnalz22p">message shared on social media</a>. The company hasn't yet specified exactly <em>when</em> it'll be available for streaming by Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers - it's only said "soon" so far - but hopefully it won't be too long after its release next week. And if it's launch information you're after, Ubisoft has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed Shadows' global release times</a>.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, of course, whisks the series to 16th-century Japan, with players witnessing events through the eyes of two new protagonists: shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe and samurai Yasuke. Eurogamer's Katharine Castle reckoned Shadows was "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far" when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">she took a look earlier this year</a>. And if you're contemplating other platforms, you might like to know Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">confirmed PS5 Pro enhancements</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-should-work-on-steam-deck-after-all-says-ubisoft">Steam Deck support</a> after doing a bit of a U-turn.

It’s the name of the game. So, why not get paid along the way? Bounties are one of the most lucrative and entertaining options for making quick cash in the game. You’ll find a bounty board in most settlements, and each one offers a variety of extra work in the form of hunting and slaying creatures, monsters, and bands of…bandits.</p><p>If you’d rather not fight continuously, the game’s side quests offer some reprieve. They pull you into the story and world-building Obsidian Entertainment designed explicitly for lore-hungry players. Some quests prove meaningless, simple fetch quests and hunter-killer jobs. Others, however, truly impress with little nuances and twists.</p><h2 id="h3064523"><a id=""></a><strong>Track down caches and chests</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do you hear that? As you explore the world of <em>Avowed</em>, you’ll incredibly frequently notice a mystical twinkling sound emanating from…somewhere. If you follow the noise, you’re rewarded with a cache or treasure chest. Now, some of these have locks preventing prying eyes and sticky fingers, but a lockpick will do wonders to loosen up the mechanism.</p><p>Once you’re inside the cache, chest, backpack—whatever it is you discover at the end of the magical twinkling sound—it’s yours to keep. Most often, it’s a handful of crafting reagents and upgrade materials. Occasionally, you’ll receive weapons or armor to sell; sometimes, there’s even gold!</p><h2 id="h3064524"><a id=""></a><strong>Sell unwanted uniques, gems, and extra equipment</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the course of your adventure, you’ll uncover or be rewarded with unwanted unique items. These come in the form of weapons or armor, and while they have an affix you likely can’t find elsewhere, you’re not required to keep them. The gold nameplate doesn’t mean anything if its unique buff doesn’t mesh well with your class or playstyle.</p><p>What then? Your best bet is to sell said unwanted unique to a merchant for a tidy sum of gold. It’s better and more lucrative than breaking down the item for spare parts. As for gems, what else will you use those hunks of rock for? They get their own inventory tab, but they’re only useful for making quick cash!</p><h2 id="h3064525"><a id=""></a><strong>What to buy with your copious amounts of gold</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-recommend-id="image://89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-recommend-id="image://89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yeah, I know. I previously told you to sell your uniques, but those were unwanted hunks of junk that take up space in your inventory.

The movie is set to hit theaters on August 8. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday </em>is set many years after the first film, where Curtis and Lohan swapped bodies as mother and daughter and learned a lot about each other in the process. This time around, Lohan has a daughter and step daughter of her own and they swap bodies with the older duo who have been through this whole thing before. </p><p>Here’s the official synopsis from Disney: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The story picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.</p></blockquote><p>I had to watch this new trailer twice to actually figure out who swapped with who, which seems like the one thing you’d want to make very obvious in your trailer about a movie where people swap bodies temporarily. </p><p>I do appreciate that <em>Freakier Friday </em>isn’t trying to be like, “Oh these two characters just moved on and assumed that all the body swappin’ was a dream or something.” No, they remember it and directly reference it multiple times during the trailer, which appears to be filled with all kinds of hijinks and shenanigans involving young girls in the bodies of older women and vice versa. For example, did you know that old people have wrinkly faces?!? Hilarious. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday</em> arrives August 8 in a theater near you. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So Sony was negging Rogen himself. </p><p>“I was like, ‘It’s based on me. That’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately,” said Rogen as he laughed. </p><p><em>Superbad </em>would end up being a huge box office hit when it landed in theaters in 2007. The movie cost around $20 million to produce, but earned $170 million at the box office. It also spawned some memes and jokes that nearly 20 years later are still floating around via t-shirts sold at mall kiosks and Hot Topics. And yes, <em>Superbad </em>is nearly 20 years old. Sorry. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation logos have started appearing on Starfield’s creation club website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Okami13_ on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1900584005000368350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), a mod on the Starfield Creation Club website features a PlayStation logo along with a PC Game and Xbox logos, hinting that a PS5 release could be around the corner. These logos are supposed to signify what platforms this mod is available on, and it’s surprising to see PlayStation listed among PC and Xbox when the platform hasn’t even been officially confirmed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Starfield mod in question with a PlayStation Logo is called <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIP—Ship Decals</a> and has been created by ValleysEdge. At the time of writing, the PlayStation logo is still visible on the mod’s page on Starfield’s official Creations website. The mod adds “work in progress” decals to your ship. Its installation size is 8.9 KB, and it was created on March 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything official about Starfield coming to the PlayStation 5. All we have heard is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> stating earlier this year that no Xbox game stays put on the platform. Bethesda also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they have “a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year.” Could one of those things be a PS5 release? We will have to wait to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-and-fallout-4-are-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim stated</a> that Starfield and Fallout are coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Also, Starfield character artist has revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-character-artist-reveals-why-gore-was-cut-from-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why gore was cut from the game</a>.

Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious subject of Willits’ statement is the KOTOR remake, which remains one of gaming’s most elusive projects. Announced in 2021, the long-awaited remake has changed hands multiple times, seemingly stopped development and restarted again, and after four years has failed to materialize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April 2024, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">the company took KOTOR with it during its split from Embracer Group</a>, and that the game was still in active development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," he said at the time. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits’ statement, which comes nearly 12 months later, reaffirms Karch’s quote. But still, even now, we have seen nothing of the KOTOR remake beyond its initial announcement video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber also has other games in the works, including a number due out this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park Survival</a> are still down for 2025, but neither has a release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Save your shinedust, everyone.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have finally offered specific details on major improvements coming to the game's much-loathed trading function, which has been an absolute mess since launch. And the improvements sound genuinely great, but it's going to take forever for them to be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to the Pokémon community forums</a>, the developers explained the upcoming changes. We're listing them here as written:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest change here is that TCG Pocket will remove the currency that's currently being used for trading: Trade Tokens. Trade Tokens were added to the game specifically to be used with trading, and frankly, they suck. They're absolutely necessary in order to trade at all, but the only way to get them is by effectively vaporizing cards you already own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">We explained it in more detail here</a>, but the tl;dr is that as things currently stand, if you want to trade one ex Pokémon for a friend's ex Pokémon, you need to throw five other ex cards in the bin first to get enough trade tokens to trade the one you want. And your friend has to do the same. While there have been a few other ways to get bonus trade tokens since then, the system overall has remained extremely discouraging for anyone who actually wants to use it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new system, on paper, is much better. Shinedust is a currency that already exists in game and is currently used to purchase "flairs" for cards — little animations to make them sparkle in specific ways when you use them in matches. You collect shinedust automatically whenever you get duplicates of cards you already have, and more shinedust is available from events and other methods. Unless you're big on flairs, you probably have a lot of it just sitting around already, and the TCG Pocket devs say they're looking into ways to give you even more to ensure trades can happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And for what it's worth, it is important for TCG Pocket to impose <em>some</em> cost to trading. Otherwise players could game the system by making tons of new accounts, opening the numerous packs handed out to players early in the game, and just trade all their new rares to their main accounts. Then rinse and repeat. Imposing a cost ensures that people are trading thoughtfully — the trade token system was just way, <em>way</em> too expensive for your average player to ever bother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one more big change listed here that will make a massive difference: the feature that will allow players to share cards they're interested in trading. As things currently stand, you can put a card up for trade, but there's no way to tell anyone what cards you might want for it unless you call up your friends outside of the game and tell them. Everyone else just has to guess. As a result, most players aren't even bothering to try and trade with strangers. But if we can offer some clue as to what an acceptable trade would be, players can make reasonable offers and actually use the system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jarxix/we_can_use_shine_dust_instead_of_trade_tokens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the community seems pretty happy with these changes</a>, and early responses are positive. There is one massive drawback, which is that players have already thrown away tons of rare cards just to collect the existing trading currency, and there's really no way to get that back. Even though existing trade tokens will be converting to shinedust, the cards are still gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's one other issue: we're going to have to wait months before any of this takes effect. The blog post suggests these changes won't be implemented until fall of this year. In the meantime, it's likely that trading will grind to a total halt, since the current system is terrible and no one is going to want to nuke their rare cards to do it if a better solution is on the way. We're likely to go through several more expansions before the "trading" in "Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" really takes off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Save that shinedust, I guess!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-journey-together-a-return-to-form-for-fans-of-trainers-pok%C3%A9mon.1134861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together</a> drops on March 28, 2025, bringing back a mechanic we haven’t seen since 2004. Trainer’s Pokémon are making a comeback, just like the classics from EX Team Magma vs. Team Aqua, and I couldn’t be more excited to preview this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set focuses on four iconic Trainers: N, Iono, Lillie, and Hop, each getting Pokémon ex that showcase the strong bonds they share with their teams. If you’ve ever wanted a deck where N’s Zoroark ex, Lillie’s Clefairy ex, or Iono’s Bellibolt ex take center stage, now’s your chance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>My Journey Together Product Openings</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-26-1741958136456.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 180 cards, there’s plenty to chase. The set includes 40+ Trainer’s Pokémon, 16 Pokémon ex, 11 Illustration Rares, six Special Illustration Rares, and three Hyper Rare gold cards. Box Toppers are also making a return, with Enhanced Booster Display Boxes featuring a stamped N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Standard Booster Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Opening a Booster Box is pure chaos in the best way. With 36 packs, the sheer volume makes every pull really exciting. My highlights include N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare, Iono’s Bellibolt ex Secret Rare, and a Hyper Rare Spiky Energy. Those were some seriously exciting moments, but even outside of the big hits, I pulled tons of solid ex cards that are going straight into my decks.
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-27-1741958396837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The one card I wanted most, Hop’s Zacian ex, didn’t show up. Lillie’s Clefairy ex Special Art Rare? Also missing, but that’s just how Booster Boxes go. You get a ton of chances, but nothing is guaranteed. That said, this was still the best way to experience the set. If you love opening packs or just want a massive injection of cards into your collection, a Booster Box is always a good time. Check out all the rare pulls further down. This box was absolutely worth it for me.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Elite Trainer Boxes always feel more premium than just grabbing loose packs. Right away, the N’s Zorua promo caught my eye, and the box itself is perfect for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing cards</a>. The sleeves, dice, and condition markers are great for anyone who plays the game, and with nine booster packs, there’s still plenty of room for some good pulls.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-28-1741958539804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting anything too crazy with only nine packs, but I still walked away with Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare, Articuno Illustration Rare, and a Veluza ex. Some really fun cards that made the opening feel totally worth it. ETBs don’t have the sheer number of hits that a Booster Box does, but there’s something nice about having a structured, all-in-one product like this. If you want a mix of pack-opening fun and collectible extras, this is a great way to experience Journey Together. Check out the full list of rare cards from our preview further down. We ended up with some serious gems.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Build &amp; Battle Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Build &amp; Battle Boxes are a totally different experience compared to a Booster Box or Elite Trainer Box, but they have their own kind of excitement. The big draw here is the prebuilt 40-card deck, which lets you jump straight into a game without spending time sorting through stacks of cards. I pulled Hop’s Snorlax as my promo, which is actually a pretty great card. Its ability gives all of Hop’s Pokémon a 30-damage boost, making it almost essential to any deck running his lineup.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-29-1741958654728.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those four packs didn’t disappoint. I pulled Mamoswine ex and Swinub Illustration Rare, which couldn’t have fit my deck’s theme better. The limited number of packs means you won’t get as many rare pulls as a Booster Box (unsurprisingly), but if you’re looking for a fast way to start playing with the new set, this is easily the best option. With four different promo cards available, I already want to pick up another box to see which one I get next. Check out my Journey Together preview pulls below to see some of the best cards we got from across all our openings.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Pokémon TCG: Journey Together Pulls</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I cracked open 49 booster packs across all our products and ended up with 18 rare cards. Some were exactly what I was hoping for, and others were total surprises. One thing is for sure, trainers will be pulling a lot more rare cards than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>. Here’s what I pulled:</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Snorlax (Promo 184)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-30-1741958767195.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A bulky Basic Pokémon with 150 HP that boosts all of Hop’s Pokémon attacks by 30 extra damage. This is a great card for any Trainer-themed deck, and while Dynamic Press hits hard, that 80 recoil damage stings. Still, the ability alone makes it a worthwhile addition to any Hop-based strategy.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Zorua (Promo 189)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-32-1741959195231.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A cute but unremarkable card that exists to evolve into something better. 70 HP and 20 damage from Scratch won’t turn any heads, but if Zoroark ex is strong in this set, Zorua will have its moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Spiky Energy Hyper Rare (190/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-33-1741959293367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An instant staple in my decks. It deals 20 damage every time the Pokémon it’s attached to gets hit, making it both offensive and defensive at the same time. Oh, and it provides Colorless Energy too. Absolute win.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Bellibolt ex-Secret Rare (172/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-34-1741959499324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 280 HP Lightning-type beast with Energy acceleration for days. Its Electric Streamer ability lets you attach unlimited Lightning Energy to Iono’s Pokémon, making it an instant engine for Lightning decks. Thunderous Bolt’s 230 damage is great, even if it does mean skipping a turn. This one’s going to see play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iris’s Fighting Spirit Full Art (180/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-35-1741959606543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A risk-reward draw Supporter that lets you discard one card and draw until you have six. This is a great way to refresh your hand, especially in decks that benefit from discarding Energy or Pokémon. It’s a full art, too, which makes it even sweeter.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare (163/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-36-1741959698372.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Lightning-type support Pokémon that lets you refill your hand with its Flashing Draw ability. The catch? You have to discard a Lightning Energy first. Mach Bolt’s 70 damage is average, but this bird is more about hand advantage than brute force.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare (167/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-37-1741959814425.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 130 HP Dragon-type that becomes more dangerous the more damage it takes. Powerful Rage can rack up serious numbers, while Virtuous Flame’s 170 damage is solid but a little Energy-intensive. If you like high-risk, high-reward plays, this one’s for you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Articuno Illustration Rare (161/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-38-1741959891188.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type setup Pokémon that can accelerate two Basic Water Energy onto itself with Frigid Fluttering. That’s useful for getting it battle-ready fast, and Ice Blast’s 110 damage is respectable. This is a great starting piece for any Water deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Swinub Illustration Rare (165/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-39-1741959990211.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This adorable little guy is actually really useful early-game. Call for Family lets you search your deck for two Basic Pokémon, which is huge for setup. Lunge Out’s 10 damage is laughable, but let’s be real, Swinub isn’t here to attack.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex Secret Rare (177/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-40-1741960077687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This 320 HP Dragon-type monster does two things really well — spread damage and hit like a truck. Wide Blast deals 50 damage to every Benched Pokémon, and Dragon Impact slams for 300 damage, but you have to discard two Energy. Absolute beast.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Zacian ex (111/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-31-1741959055767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Steel-type legendary with a brutal 240-damage attack. The downside? Brave Slash can’t be used twice in a row, which means you need a switching strategy. Insta-Strike does a little spread damage, but Zacian is here to knock things out in one hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Alcremie ex (075/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-41-1741960162418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A support-heavy Psychic Pokémon that heals 30 damage every turn thanks to its Confectionary Gift ability. Whipped Shot’s 160 damage is solid, but this card is best used as a sustain option in control decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mimikyu ex (069/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-42-1741960253913.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A tricky Pokémon that loves spreading damage. Mischievous Hands puts three damage counters on two of your opponent’s Pokémon, setting up knockouts later. Ghostly Trip deals 120 damage and Confuses the Active Pokémon, which is a great way to disrupt their plays.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Veluza ex (043/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-43-1741960335962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type glass cannon that can hit for 240 damage — if you’re willing to discard your whole hand. Purging Strike is high-risk, high-reward, and Razor Fin’s 30 damage is barely worth mentioning. This card is all-in or nothing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lillie’s Clefairy ex (056/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-44-1741960440336.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Psychic-type that punishes Dragon decks with its Fairy Zone ability, which makes all Dragon Pokémon weak to Psychic. Full Moon Rondo scales its damage based on both players’ Bench size, making it a potential late-game sweeper.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Volcanion ex (031/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-45-1741960586672.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Fire-type bruiser that burns the opponent’s Active Pokémon just by being in play, thanks to its Scalding Steam ability.Scorching Cyclone’s 160 damage is great, and moving an Energy to a Benched Pokémon makes it even better.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mamoswine ex (079/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-46-1741960688002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An absolute tank at 340 HP that can search your deck for any Pokémon once per turn with Mammoth Hauler. Rumbling March starts at 180 damage but scales up if you have more Stage 2 Pokémon on your Bench, which makes it terrifying in evolution-heavy decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex (114/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-47-1741960777849.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the second Salamence ex I pulled, and I’m not complaining. Same brutal power as the other one with Wide Blast for spreading damage and Dragon Impact for a massive 300 damage hit. If you like big, hard-hitting Pokémon, this is the one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Journey Together?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Journey Together is shaping up to be one of the most exciting Pokémon TCG expansions in years. The return of Trainer’s Pokémon, a nostalgic feature that hasn’t been seen in years, adds an extra layer of personality to battles. If you're collecting cards for their stunning artwork, competitive value, or just sheer nostalgia, this set has something for everyone.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its March 28 release date just around the corner, now’s the time to start planning which cards you want to chase. Whether it’s N’s Reshiram, Iono’s Bellibolt ex, or the elusive Hyper Rare Spiky Energy, there’s no shortage of incredible pulls waiting to be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
