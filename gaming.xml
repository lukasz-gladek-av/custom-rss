The <em>Secret Lair x Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation</em> will follow on from the Sakura Superstar set that was announced in April.

<p>Fans of Hatsune Miku and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will be able to purchase this set of cards starting on Monday June 24th at 9am PDT. The Summer Superdrop 2024 event will be running until July 14th at 11:59pm PDT but these cards will only be available while supplies last so if you want to get them you should be ready on the <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us">Secret Lair website when the event drops</a>. The last set of Hatsune Miku cards sold out on the first day!</p>
<p>As with the Spring 'Sakura' drop this collection will feature six cards starring Hatsune Miku, one of which has been renamed to better align itself with the Miku theming. The six cards that will be part of this collection are:</p>
<ul><li>Diabolic Tutor</li>
<li>Chord of Calling</li>
<li>Miku, Child of Song (This card is a reskinned Child of Alara)</li>
<li>Song of Creation</li>

<li>Thespian's Stage</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to purchase the Regular Editions of these cards for $29.99 or you can purchase a Rainbow Foil Edition of the set for $39.99. You will be able to purchase these sets in both English as well as Japanese so make sure you're getting the correct one at checkout.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-gets-new-voice-chat-moderation-that-cannot-be-turned-off-in-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You can always turn off voice chat.</h2></div><section><p>EA has added new voice chat moderation features to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> designed to promote more positive play within the game.</p><p>Battlefield 2042, like many competitive multiplayer games, suffers from some toxic behavior from players. These new features now live in the first-person shooter over two years after it launched aim to provide players with an easy way to report it.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/battlefield/battlefield-2042/voice-chat-moderation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s help page</a>, the company said voice chat moderation is used when reviewing reports of “harmful or offensive” voice chat, so its support teams can “action the reports appropriately.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s how it works: when you report a player, EA’s support team automatically receives a recording of the session you wish to report. Then, after evaluating the recording, the support team will make a decision according to EA’s Positive Play Charter and “enforce a solution.”</p><p>As outlined by EA, here’s how to report someone through Battlefield 2042’s Squad and Players list:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Open the Pause menu.</li><li>Choose Squad and Players.</li><li>Select the player’s name on the list.</li><li>Choose More.</li><li>If you want to report them, select Report.</li><li>Select Abusive Voice Chat.</li></ul><p>If you just want to block the player, follow the same steps above, select Block, and then confirm when you’re asked to. Blocked players are also muted for you in voice and text chat.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can’t turn voice chat moderation off, but you <em>can</em> choose not to use voice chat when you play. EA said this is “to protect players.”</p><p>The expectation is this new voice chat moderation feature will be used in future Battlefield games. In April, EA announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-season-7-motive-connected-battlefield-universe">Battlefield 2042 Season 7 is officially its last</a>, with development of the Connected Battlefield Universe now in full swing. Battlefield general manager Byron Beede explained that it's time for the franchise to "turn from the present to the future." To that end, he said, EA would continue to support Battlefield 2042 with "in-game challenges, events, modes, and of course, ongoing maintenance," but would move away from a seasonal structure when Season 7 wraps up this month.</p><p>Season 7 marks the end of Battlefield 2042's comeback trail after its disappointing release back in 2021, which saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review"><u>fans and critics pan its 128-player matches and its Specialist system</u></a>, among other things. In the years since it has managed to rehabilitate its reputation somewhat, though it still sits at Mixed on Steam.</p><p>EA has a number of developers working on future Battlefield projects, including a team at Dead Space remake maker EA Motive, Ripple Effect, DICE, and Criterion.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive (but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-may-update-causes-head-scratching-new-problems/1100-6523649/">rather underwhelming</a>) May update, Bethesda has just released version ​​1.12.30 of the game, known as the June update. Starfield's June update includes a number of features, including new missions, a new bounty-scanning mechanic, and the introduction of the Starfield Creation Kit for all modders (it was previously released for modders hand-picked by Bethesda).</p><p dir="ltr">Sadly, it seems that land vehicles--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">Bethesda confirmed are in development</a> last month--still aren't on the menu (yet). Regardless, the update includes quite a few changes, quality-of-life improvements, and, of course, a good number of bug-fixes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiN5PDu400s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiN5PDu400s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Starfield Creation Kit is now available to all modders, and can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" rel="nofollow ">downloaded on Steam</a>. Players on all platforms can now access Creations, including unique new missions, gear, skins, and weapons, among other content. Creations can be accessed via the game's menu, and Bethesda has a special surprise for certain players: Anyone who ordered the Premium Edition of Starfield will find that 1,000 Creation Credits have been added to their account, free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Two new Tracker's Alliance missions have also been added. The first, called The Starjacker, puts players in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in various parts of The Settled Systems. The second mission, called The Vulture, is a Bethesda Game Studios Creation, meaning it can only be accessed via the Creations menu mentioned above. This new mission will cost real-life cash unless you happen to have received the aforementioned 1,000 Creation Credits for ordering the Special Edition version of Starfield. Both missions see players taking on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">serious bounty-hunting gigs</a> that can end in riches--or disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of bounty-hunting, Starfield's June update introduces a new "bounty scanner" mechanic, which enables players to seek out targets with active bounties on their heads, and dispose of them (or work things out without exchanging gunfire). Using the scanner function, players can now identify targets in crowds of NPCs. Wanted individuals will be highlighted in red, and scanning them directly will reveal their name, the crimes they're wanted for, and how many credits the player will earn for bringing them in. Tracker-loving, trigger-happy players who are especially hungry for bounty-hunting content can also check out the Elite Tracker's Alliance mission board for more heads to hunt.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still no news on when land vehicles will be added to the game, but they're likely to arrive sometime between now and the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-gets-a-trippy-trailer-new-content-launching-today/1100-6524080/">Starfield's upcoming Shattered Space expansion</a>--a DLC focused on an abandoned space station and ancient Va'Ruun secrets--which is scheduled to release sometime this fall.</p><p>The full Starfield version 1.12.30 patch notes are listed below.

The answer to that is…of course! It’s a learning process, just like everything else. It doesn’t happen overnight. I still remember when I didn’t even know the first thing about making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But after some time passed and looking over certain resources again and again, everything started to fall into place…like a game of Tetris, where you have all those falling pieces left and right and must quickly rotate/guide them to those open gaps at the bottom. Your disability, whatever it may be, does not define you. You can be anything you set your mind to, and that includes making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re all different. We do things differently, learn differently, and so on. As long as your heart is in the right place and making video games is your passion, you’ll be making video games in no time! I don’t know everything about making video games (and I never will), but I do know enough to build them from scratch for everyone to enjoy. Some people like my games…some do not, and that’s ok.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is actually one of the things you must be prepared for. Not everybody’s going to like what you make. Any obstacle that comes your way will always be overcome by your love and passion for making video games. It’s like they say: ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Where there’s a will, there’s a way</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’. Life is full of trial and error, especially when it comes to making video games. I make video games, and I have high-functioning autism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That never stopped me from doing what I love. Don’t let it stop you. Do you have a disability? Do you want to make video games? If you’ve answered “yes” to both of these questions, I have one thing to say to you: Go for it! Just remember, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that we’ve spent some in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4’s</a> initial phase, it’s time to gear up for the mid-season update. Here’s when <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded releases, and what to expect.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-start" data-injectable="false">When does MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded start?</h2> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Based on the Battle Pass duration, <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded is expected to come out on June 26, 2024. Although the date and timing have yet to be confirmed, it will likely debut at 9 a.m. PT/11 a.m. CST/12 p.m. EST.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">With the Reloaded patch, the update size should be a manageable amount of space, typically around 18 to 25 GB. A pre-load should be available the day before the launch to ensure you’re fully prepared. This way, you can dive right into the action as soon as it’s live.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded" data-injectable="false">What to expect in MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded </h2> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">The <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone </em><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 roadmap</a> gives us a glimpse into what to expect for its Reloaded release.

 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer is set to introduce <strong>two new 6v6 core maps: Incline and Das Gross<em>.</em></strong> Incline will take you high above the mountains of Urzikstan in a medium-sized map, perfect for mid-range loadouts. And if that’s not enough, Das Gross will transform Das Haus into an alien nightmare, adding a whole new twist to your gaming experience.</p> <h3 id="h-mw3-game-modes" data-injectable="false">MW3 game modes</h3> <figure data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Havoc mode returns in Season 4 to change up the classic dynamics of Team Deathmatch. You may remember this entry from <em>Modern Warfare 2’s </em>Season 5 launch, where you’ll be rewarded with various modifiers throughout the match. In particular, Operators can equip the Camera Shift ability to change to third-person mode.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Another upcoming game mode will also unleash a new wave of Team Deathmatch content with Headshots Only. The challenge is pretty self-explanatory, in which players can only get kills when aiming for an Operator’s head.</p>

Players can tackle the Unstable Rift Exclusion Zone to earn more rewards and wipe out hordes of zombies. The quest can be replayed as many times as you want, and weapon/schematic cooldowns will be refreshed each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-warzone-weapons-and-events" data-injectable="false">Warzone weapons and events</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone’s </em>Season 4 Reloaded content has been shrouded in mystery, with a few updates garnering a ‘Redacted’ title. What we do know, however, is that rare weaponry will be available in Loot Hot Zones or Bunkers. The guns in question haven’t been revealed yet, so we’ll need to wait until more Reloaded information comes out. Plus, Bunkers will be receiving an update of their own, increasing enemy activity within its radius. </p>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Other than the exclusive weapons, the Runaway Train Public Event will begin during Season 4 Reloaded.

However, Reloaded will introduce new weapons that could take over their spot. This includes the Reclaimer 18 Shotgun and Sledgehammer Melee Weapon. While Reclaimer 18 was previously shown in <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Sledgehammer is a brand-new weapon that packs a 20-pound head.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">Other content will presumably arrive for Season 4 Reloaded, but for now, these are the confirmed features from the roadmap.

In a “journey ahead” stream today, Bungie disclosed the first details on its plans for the rest of the year ahead with <em>Destiny 2</em> and even teased a 2025 release for new content that’s codenamed “Frontiers.”</p><p>Until Frontiers arrives next year, <em>Destiny 2</em> will continue with new episodes of story content that explore what’s happened after the conclusion of <em>The Final Shape</em>. <em>Destiny 2</em> players have just battled The Witness in the latest expansion, the main antagonist of&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s light and darkness saga, which has created what Bungie is calling echoes throughout the universe. </p><div><figcaption><em>Destiny 2 is getting loot potions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bungie</cite></p></div><p>The first echo has landed on Nessus, which is why <em>Destiny 2</em> players have noticed earthquakes occurring on that planet over the weekend. Nessus is changing, and so are the Vex enemies that inhabit it, which <em>Destiny 2</em> players will start to discover this week as <em>The Final Shape</em> seasonal content begins with this first episode of stories. </p><p>Later in the year, the second echo, Revenant, will see the focus switch to the Fallen enemies, with <em>Destiny 2</em> players turning into vampire hunters that have craftable potions. After Revenant the final episode is Heresy, which will focus on the Hive pantheon enemies. And yes, we’re heading back to the dreadnought to see what’s changed with the Hive. There will even be armor that’s themed around Eris Morn, <em>Destiny</em>’s very own Hive lore expert.</p><p>After Heresy ends and year 11 of <em>Destiny 2</em> begins in 2025, a new “Frontiers” drop of content is on the way. “The journey continues,” teases Bungie. It’s not clear what storyline the Frontiers content will cover, but it doesn’t seem to be the big annual expansion that Bungie typically puts out for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Either way, Bungie is making it clear that <em>Destiny 2</em> isn’t going anywhere just yet, despite speculation over whether or not a <em>Destiny 3</em> is on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="G4PEix">One way to ensure that a favorite show or movie never disappears from streaming rotation? Buy a physical copy. On Monday, the animation distributor GKIDS announced that fans of Netflix’s <em>League of Legends</em> series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24026643/arcane-season-two-netflix-teaser-trailer-release-warwick-singed-riot-games"><em>Arcane</em></a> would soon have that chance, with Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray releases planned for later this year.</p>
<p id="59AXMA">While <em>Arcane</em> carved out backstories for known <em>League of Legends</em> characters Vi and Jinx, the animated series triumphed on Netflix thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22800666/arcane-season-1-review">a tenuous connection to known lore</a> and an emphasis on stylish action and dramatic character work. Produced by the French animation studio Fortiche for Riot Games, the series was a major hit for the streamer, clocking over 34 million hours of viewership in its first week. And based on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix">Netflix’s recent report of 2023 stats</a>, the series is <em>still</em> finding millions of viewers two years later as people wait and/or catch up ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix"><em>Arcane</em> season 2</a>, due out in November. </p>

<p id="pf2jwY">Details are light on what GKIDS might pack into a physical release, but the initial announcement promises “a full product array later this year, ranging from digital to premium editions, including a 4K version exclusive to the home entertainment release.” But in a rare tone for a Blu-ray licensing agreement, the folks at GKIDS seem over the moon to be making a physical edition of the series possible. The news broke out of the Annecy International Animation Festival, where where the distributor also acquired rights to Science Saru’s anime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxXNtfIapqs"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a><em> </em>and a 4K restoration of Mamoru Oshii’s masterpiece <em>Angel’s Egg</em>.</p>
<p id="o27YJN">“We are MONSTER fans of [<em>Arcane</em>],” said GKIDS founder and CEO Eric Beckman in a statement, “and our team is having a blast collaborating with the creatives at Riot and Fortiche to put together an amazing package for the fans. This project was dreamt up on the lawn by the lake at Annecy, so we are extra happy to be able to announce this collaboration at the festival and true home of animation.”</p>
<p id="RRBOgy">There’s no word on when <em>Arcane</em> season 1 will hit Blu-ray, but GKIDS promises more announcements to come later this year.</p>

The latest entry in the supernatural adventure series will return to original protagonist Max Caulfield as she solves the murder of her friend by jumping between alternate timelines. While that’s an exciting prospect for longtime fans, the game has been mired in a bit of controversy as Square Enix has rolled out details about its release plans.<br></p><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Like previous games in the series, <em>Double Exposure </em>will be an episodic game. However, it won’t be rolling out periodically like the first few games did, and will instead follow <em>True Colors</em>’ format of releasing all the episodes at once. Well, with one catch. The game’s $80 Ultimate Edition will let you play the first two chapters on October 15, two weeks before the game’s October 29 release date. Fans are criticizing this decision (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>) both because it’s incentivizing players to pay up for early access and because it will open up fans who can’t afford or don’t want to pay extra to spoilers for two weeks. The move would almost feel like an homage to the original game’s structure if it wasn’t also kinda gross.</p><p>“I feel like Square Enix locked this awesome feature behind a paywall,” upper_camel_case wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>. “[Episodic releasing] made the original <em>Life Is Strange</em> such a great experience when it originally released. Now only the people who are willing to pay a lot of money for something they don’t know if it’s even good are going to be able to experience it. They are preying on the most devoted fans. Not nice.”</p><p>It’s clear Square Enix is banking on FOMO to get people to fork over the extra $30, as even their marketing copy on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span> highlights how this lets people be part of the discussion around Max’s latest story.</p><p>“Don’t miss your chance to join the conversation around this unforgettable supernatural murder mystery,” the Steam page reads.</p><p><em>Double Exposure </em>isn’t the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357">only video game in the world</a></span> that lets people pay more to play early, but two weeks is a much larger head start than these arrangements usually allow for. However, it does have the advantage of not being an online game like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> which had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239">server trouble during this early access period</a></span>, rendering it useless after all that money spent. The trade-off is that, inevitably, someone will get spoiled on those first two episodes because they can’t justify the cost. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all this, <em>Double Exposure </em>is also falling into another tiresome modern video game release trend in that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$60 “collector’s edition”</a></span> doesn’t actually contain a copy of the game. There’s some neat stuff in the package, including a vinyl soundtrack and artbook, but Square Enix’s store page puts in big red letters that the actual <em>Double Exposure</em> game is sold separately. If you want both this big box of goodies <em>and</em> to see Max’s next chapter unfold, you’ll have to fork over an extra $50 (or $80, if you want the early access). Honestly, a $110 collector’s edition isn’t even that expensive by modern standards, but the unnecessary obtuseness in how it’s sold is the issue. Collector’s Editions that are just boxes of swag that don’t include the game aren’t actually “editions” of the game at all.<br></p><p>Ultimately these are big company decisions separate from whether <em>Double Exposure </em>will be any good or not, but it’s not the best look for a game that’s clearly banking on fans’ love for the 2015 original. The <em>Life is Strange </em>series has become known for hopping between protagonists at this point and going back to Max is likely to draw back in old fans, so it’s a shame it has this weighing it down right out the gate. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bungie released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PYzMqhu3Fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“journey ahead” trailer</a> today, announcing that Destiny 2 Codename Frontiers will arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer does not confirm an exact release date for Frontiers. Instead, it simply teases that “the journey continues.” So, that remains the biggest reveal for Year 11 today.</p>



<p>However, the new Destiny 2 trailer also reveals new footage for Year 10 episodes. These will include Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy. </p>



<p>Bungie showcased gameplay and concept art alongside developer narration. However, much of the footage added a disclaimer that it remains in-progress, and it is still subject to change.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-to-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay that lasted months</a>, Bungie finally released Destiny 2’s The Final Shape DLC last week. It is the culmination of years of storytelling, an epic conclusion for the Light and Darkness saga.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Sony itself appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-dlc-leaks-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak The Final Shape content early</a>, including the entire campaign. </p>



<p>The Final Shape DLC ultimately earned decent ratings, and currently holds a 7.2 user score on Metacritic. It adds new collections, weapons, story, and more.</p>



<p>Recent rumors from April 2024 suggest that Bungie could be working on Destiny 3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-possibly-developing-destiny-3-under-codename-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the codename Payback</a>. Paul Tassi of Forbes commented on an old, notable post from Reddit, though Tassi did not confirm the rumor outright.</p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Bungie also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-cheat-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a key lawsuit</a> against cheat provider Phoenix Digital.</p>

This time, the Zeds are more heavily armed and they're also able to fight as an army instead of a mindless horde.</p><p>The trailer also reintroduces Mr. Foster and his Nightfall commandos as they attack an army depot that has been taken over by Zed forces. Mr. Foster even seems to revel in the opportunity to destroy these creatures.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Tripwire has set Killing Floor 3's story in 2091, seven decades after Killing Floor 2. The Zeds have been nearly perfected by Megacorp Horzine, and the Nightfall team might be the only thing standing between these creatures and the rest of humanity. Fortunately for players, the Nightfall team has a few new tricks of their own including specialized weapons, the ability to climb and dash, and new environmental traps that can be laid down to devastate the Zeds.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 will be available on PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> has plenty of iconic maps, but perhaps none are more popular than Nuketown. While it was always expected that it would arrive in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops 6</em> at some point, eagle eyes have already spotted in the game ahead of release. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">During the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> reveal at <em>Call of Duty Direct</em>, Treyarch gave us not only a glimpse at the game’s new movement features and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-finally-ends-the-round-based-zombies-map-drought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round-based Zombies</a> but also showed off an early look at the UI. As spotted by CharlieIntel, in the corner of the lobby UI, we can see the game loading into a match on Nuketown, confirming that the map is coming this fall. </p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Nuketown has been a feature in the <em>Black Ops</em> series since 2010 when it first appeared in the first entry of the series. It’s returned in every Treyarch-developed game ever since. With five appearances in mainline <em>CoD</em> games, and also a cameo in <em>CoD: Mobile</em>, it was almost guaranteed that it would be in <em>BO6</em>, but it’s still nice to know it’s happening. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">It’s no surprise that it’s coming back though, as it’s <em>CoD</em>‘s most popular map. In <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Nuketown 24/7 playlist was one of the game’s most played and is just match after match played on the map over and over again. In fact, when Treyarch did remove the mode for a period, fans spent the entire time asking when it was coming back. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that we’ll be able to play it at release, as Treyarch has said the game will launch with 16 new maps, which Nuketown definitely is not. In my opinion, Nuketown is the perfect map to drop with the game’s first seasonal update, along with a new weapon and likely the <em>Black Ops 6</em> patch for <em>Warzone</em>. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">A true fan-favorite, I personally can’t wait to get back on Nuketown, as it’s often the map I play the most. If you’re ranking up guns or trying to complete camo challenges, Nuketown 24/7 playlists promise lots of gunfights in a small location, making it perfect for grinding your way through the progression system. </p>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">We’ll be sure to keep you updated as we learn more about Nuketown’s introduction to <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

  <p id="S5ZB5M">In classic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a> fashion, the Jedi of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">the High Republic novels</a> — who have now made the jump to live action in the form of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171592/star-wars-acolyte-kill-jedi-mae-sith-master-no-weapon"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> — have spent much of the past few years veering toward disaster. Amid the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/21507879/star-wars-high-republic-the-great-disaster-jedi-explained">“Great Disaster,”</a> which provided an explosive opening to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2021/1/12/22221112/light-of-the-jedi-spoilers-author-charles-soule-interview">Charles Soule’s <em>The Light of the Jedi</em></a>, they were first responders. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/22591953/star-wars-high-republic-books-order-wave-3-sdcc-2021">cataclysmic events</a> of Claudia Gray’s <em>The Fallen Star </em>made them victims. Now, after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22867009/star-wars-high-republic-books-phase-2-announcement">a prequel jaunt in The High Republic phase 2</a>, phase 3 is in full swing with the second adult novel in the sequence, Tessa Gratton’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Temptation of the Force</em></a><em>, </em>in which the Jedi finally start fighting back.</p>
<p id="7pof2s">Following up George Mann’s <em>The Eye of Darkness</em>, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> reunites the Jedi of the High Republic Era after the marauder-terrorist group known as the Nihil staged a violent takeover of a portion of the Outer Rim known as the Occlusion Zone. Focused on the reunion of star-crossed Jedi Avar Kriss and Elzar Mann, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> promises to pay off some long-simmering character work while rallying for what ought to be an explosive conclusion in next spring’s <em>Trials of the Jedi</em> by Charles Soule. </p>
<p id="eA7nhx">In this exclusive excerpt from <em>Temptation of the Force</em>, ahead of its debut on June 11, we see the beginning of the Jedi’s offensive against the Nihil — one that doesn’t involve weapons of warfare, but words of inspiration. </p>
<hr id="k2GELT">
<p id="L6Ubw1"><em><strong>While the Jedi take the fight directly to the Nihil, within the Occlusion Zone, a group of freedom fighters work to support the planets imprisoned in Nihil space, spreading a message of hope and freedom. </strong></em></p>
<h2 id="HEF0ES"><strong>RILIAS II, INSIDE THE OCCLUSION ZONE</strong></h2>
<p id="5FKYvS">Cair San Tekka had been a lot of things in his relatively short life: a spy, a musician, a secret husband, a security aide, a secretary, a punk kid, a troublemaker, a pilot, and now a smuggler and freedom fighter. He wasn’t the only one running various rebellions throughout Nihil space, and several such rebel groups had found ways to access the constantly changing anti-scav codes to allow for safer travel out here on the frontier, as well as a comm subroutine channel that made it through the Nihil comm embargo. Cair managed those things, too. But what he had that nobody else had was someone who provided him with frequently updated time-phased Path codes that could be used by the Jedi to penetrate the Stormwall. </p>

<p id="ycRPKL">Those ships were what allowed Cair to be down in the central water garden of Rilias II, huddled in the bowl of their foris alloy funnel. The funnel had been built a few generations ago as a decorative fountain the size of a small building, out of a metal mined on one of their moons that allowed for an exact resonance with the minerals found in their perma-scatter clouds. The funnel gathered thin trickles of water all day and night from the water garden, and at sunrise and sunset most days of the year, when the light filtered through the clouds, it hit the alloy funnel. The funnel’s reverberation caused particles in the air to vibrate into little rainbow stars. </p>
<p id="tglXni">It also amplified certain audio frequencies. </p>
<p id="KLVcmd">Cair shifted the strap of his harness to better reach the small panel that was part of the controls in the base of the funnel. He balanced against the sloped, slippery wall with his feet and worked quickly to remove a datachip and replace it with his sliced frequency emitter. </p>
<p id="Lc9r7c">This would be the fifth morale drop he’d personally led, but the first that included a visual component. </p>
<p id="YaiwhU">Ever since he’d met up with Rhil Dairo last month, she’d been angling to find a way to include visuals in their drops. Symbols and smiles, she’d insisted again and again. Cair hadn’t disagreed with the sentiment, only the practicality. </p>
<p id="TP7GRB">But today they had means and opportunity. </p>
<p id="a6irLq">It was a three-pronged setup: Cair down here slicing the funnel to match the necessary frequencies, Rhil up in orbit with the <em>Brightbird</em>— or as it was known in these parts, the Nihil transport <em>Blood Vulture</em>— and Belin ready in his ship on the other side of the sparkling felsic cliffs edging the city. Rhil had dropped the refitted comm buoy with her newest broadcast, active to the frequencies Cair matched with the funnel, and Belin would fly over the city, releasing a hydro-spray to activate the clouds prematurely. Then their show would begin. </p>
<p id="GpQY8q">Cair finished his slice and hit the countdown monitor he’d brought. It synced up with the similar countdown embedded in his artificial hand. He grinned. So far, so good. </p>
<p id="q2a1jp">Climbing out of the funnel took a bit of time, but Cair hooked his legs over the edge and found a seat on a broad ruffled lily pad. He leaned back on the soft moss and tilted his head up. The teal sky was striped by thin blushing scatter clouds, and every once in a while, a personal shuttle zipped past.</p>
<p id="SIENko">Rilias II had been hard hit by the Nihil, but its central government had capitulated faster than many, giving in to demands for total surrender and allowing regular Nihil rioting missions under the cover of “tax collecting.” Neighborhoods had been razed and anybody who fought back taken into custody or killed. It was a horribly typical story of the past year in the Occlusion Zone, but thanks to quick thinking or cowardly leaders, enough of the populace and riches had been sacrificed to semi-mollify the Nihil. </p>
<p id="uluPQv">That just made Cair’s job more important. He had to remind people they needed to fight. And they could survive. There was hope. It was worth reaching out, worth trying. Everybody needed to be trying. </p>
<p id="Pu0fZC">The water garden shuddered under him as the city’s inner mechanisms opened the underground rivers. It was nearly time. </p>
<p id="HFCyyP">Cair tried not to feel too deeply about the moment of peace. Waiting was the only peace he got these days. The peace between planning and action. </p>
<p id="8b40JB">As always, he pretended he could feel the Force thrumming through everything, connecting him to the lily pad and water, to the air and atmosphere, to his allies in their positions, to the stars beyond, to his family—all of whom were in Republic space now, thank the Force. Cair wasn’t strong in the Force in the least, but he’d been raised to trust it anyway. Sometimes he pretended so well he could actually feel it in his bones. </p>
<p id="ZMq0Yf">The countdown alert notified him he had a minute, and Cair got up onto his feet. He stood at the edge of the funnel as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Security teams—the local constabulary indebted to the Nihil now and oppressed by them—could see him if they looked. If Cair was seen, he might be shot on sight. Or he might be cheered. </p>
<p id="njteCJ">But Cair felt deeply that he needed to be seen. Somebody would tell the story: A human had been here and caused this disruption. Not from space, not from the distance beyond the Stormwall. Someone here. In the flesh. Risking death and torture to bring them this message.</p>
<p id="unuiPs">Cair stood, ignoring the fear. This was worth being afraid. Worth death. It had to be. He’d spent too much of his life serving only his family’s benefit, making underhanded business deals instead of music, toying with industrial espionage instead of new wavelengths for his dulcimer. He was good at creating trouble and spycraft, and he’d never regretted prioritizing what his uncles and parents pushed him toward. Until he met somebody even better at such games, and married him. </p>
<p id="HZwSvu">Of course, with the Nihil occupation, nothing was a game anymore. Cair had done his best to lay low, help those he could, and keep himself from putting a target on his husband’s back. He hadn’t known what else <em>to </em>do. </p>
<p id="5V4sxs">Now he knew. </p>
<p id="KMRCkI">He’d seen people sacrifice everything to keep their families alive. He’d witnessed far-flung San Tekkas disregard profit and exploration and everything Cair thought made San Tekkas San Tekkas just to save a handful of people in danger. They’d been more than brave, risked everything, left it all behind, not for glory or profit but for <em>hope. </em>He’d lost his hand learning to make the same choice. </p>
<p id="BXefUs">It still wasn’t easy to do. But every time Cair chose hope, it got a little less scary. </p>
<p id="ugydwY">Warm wind brushed strands of messy black hair across his face. He made himself smile. That would be the last thing he did, if it was the last thing he did. His dramatic husband would say, <em>Running should be the last thing you do, you fool. </em></p>
<p id="Eg2yFW">Cair heard the high scream of Belin’s engine before he saw the glint of the ship out at the line of felsic cliffs. </p>
<p id="JAba7r">It was time. </p>
<p id="a1Btfd">Cair twisted a tiny red dial on his black-metal hand, and it snapped with a frequency. The funnel hummed in answer. </p>
<p id="LMkQd5">The rest was up to Rhil and Belin. </p>
<p id="LM7hmx">Suddenly Rhil’s voice blasted throughout the sky: “Greetings, free citizens of the frontier! This is your friend and ally Rhil Dairo, and today we have a message from a hero you all know!”</p>
<p id="KuTYQl">Cair laughed. Rhil’s broadcast would travel from buoy to buoy until the Nihil managed to stop it. </p>
<p id="HxI2Ap">The funnel thrummed harder, and there came Belin, streaking across the sky in his sharp-nosed shuttle. Behind him trailed a shimmer as the hydro-spray clung to the lower atmosphere, ready. </p>
<p id="An3wEZ">Cair raised a hand to Belin, who vanished over the distant horizon. </p>
<p id="6ZZyzo">The spray caught the sunlight and the funnel flared. </p>
<p id="R1ccHV">“Hello, this is Jedi Master Avar Kriss,” the Jedi’s voice rang out. </p>
<p id="a1i8t1">Everywhere in this system, and hopefully the neighboring as well, and in every Nihil ship and city with comms that could be reached, Avar Kriss spoke to those listening. </p>
<p id="MAVbZF">But here on Rilias II, held in shape by the rainbow frequencies of the alloy funnel, Avar Kriss’s face looked down like a god. </p>
<p id="Lg09qn">If Cair knew Jedi at all, he knew she’d hate the comparison. But Cair relished it. He grinned and laughed again. And before he hightailed it to his mark to be picked up in a hurry, he stood there, watching and listening. </p>
<p id="4rBwG5">“I bring a message of hope, though it is difficult to hear. But listen, please. Even I am familiar with despair. I know it. That feeling when everything is too much, when the pressure of looking for anything inside of tomorrow is overwhelming. It hurts. I know it, too. In times like that just remember who you are—who you want to be. Who you can be. Focus on that. Fight with me, if that is who you can be. But if you cannot, you do not have to fight. I won’t ask that of you. There are people already fighting for you. For all of us. All I am asking of you today is that you live. Live today, and try to find hope tomorrow. This is Jedi Master Avar Kriss. Help is on the way.”</p>

<p>A new version of Microsoft's top-end Xbox Series X will launch without a disc drive for the first time this holiday season.</p>
<p>The new "Digital Edition" console option—which sports 1TB of storage and an Xbox Series S-like "Robot White" color scheme—will be available "in select markets" for an estimated retail price of $449 (or 500 euros). That price is just $50 less than the MSRP for the current, disc-drive-equipped Xbox Series X, which is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x/8wj714n3rbtl">currently on sale for $449 from the Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>Word of Microsoft's plans for a disc-drive-free Xbox Series X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">first leaked last September</a> as part of the Federal Trade Commission's case against the Microsoft/Activision merger. But the new disc-free Series X bears little resemblance to the cylindrical "Brooklin" refresh shown in those leaked promo materials, which also touted redesigned internals and improved power usage. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">said at the time</a> that "so much has changed" from the "old emails and documents" in those leaks.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The new Digital Edition Series X will seemingly be on store shelves alongside the standard edition, meaning that Microsoft is not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">moving away from disc-based games entirely</a> just yet. To the contrary, a new "Galaxy Black" Xbox Series X model with a disc drive and 2TB of storage is also planned to launch "in limited quantities" this holiday season at a price of $600. That makes the new hardware slightly cheaper than buying a current Xbox Series X and adding on 1TB of expansion storage <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-expansion-card">for about $150</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also planning a holiday launch for a version of its 1TB edition of the Xbox Series S in Robot White, supplementing the "Carbon Black" version that launched last September. Both colors will be available for $349.</p>

<p>Alongside the weekend hardware announcements, Xbox President Sarah Bond vaguely asserted that they were "hard at work on the next generation" of Xbox hardware and will be "pushing the technical boundaries in our future hardware."</p>

                <p>Rumors have swirled about a handheld Xbox console for years, but none of them have ever quite panned out. At this year's Xbox Game Showcase, Xbox chief Phil Spencer made his feelings on the matter clear. Asked about the concept in a recent interview, Spencer simply said: "I think we should have a handheld."</p><p dir="ltr">While that statement--given in a discussion with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto&amp;t=1540s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>--appears to speak for itself, Spencer quickly stated that the interviewer will also have to speak to Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, on the issue. He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">expressed positive feelings</a> about the future of Xbox hardware, calling it "pretty awesome," and that he's excited to talk about "different form factors" in that hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer's response falls short of an official announcement of an Xbox handheld, but it would certainly seem to indicate that the company is headed in that direction. However, what form it might take remains to be seen. In that same interview, Spencer addressed the closure of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">several Microsoft-owned game studios</a> earlier this year, including Tango Gameworks, calling it "a decision that is very hard on those teams" and stating that he "has to run a sustainable business inside the company."</p><p dir="ltr">The success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">Steam Deck</a> and similar devices has triggered a renaissance in portable gaming over the past few years, which may have prompted Xbox to seriously consider releasing a portable console. Sony's PlayStation Portal has also enjoyed strong sales, and it's possible that Xbox might differentiate its console by offering local play (rather than remote-only). That said, Xbox did announce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">new hardware</a> at the showcase in the form of an all-digital Xbox Series X, which is all-white and has no disk drive. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">report from earlier this year</a> suggested that Microsoft was working on an Xbox handheld prototype, and it's apparently similar to the Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/#3">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, check out our recap.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aptoide-becomes-first-non-apple-ios-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>App store has launched with six games, including Word Jungle and Condor – A Leap of Faith</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Independent app store Aptoide has launched on iOS in Europe after the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">Digital Markets Act was introduced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/">TechCrunch</a>, the store launched last Thursday with six titles including Word Jungle, Condor – A Leap of Faith, and Charades Guess the Word.</p>
<p>Over 100 developers have cited interest on Aptoide so far, in addition to a waitlist of 20,000 users. Between 500 and 1,000 access codes will be distributed daily to enable the app to control growth and receive feedback.</p>
<p>Aptoide also has an alternative in-app purchase solution for iOS, and offers a IAP software development kit for game developers and users launched in collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>"The Aptoide iOS game store represents a significant shift in the way users and developers interact with the iOS gaming ecosystem," said company co-founder and CEO Paulo Trezentos.</p>
<p>"It marks a significant departure from the traditional iOS gaming ecosystem, which has been controlled by Apple's App Store. We thank Apple for their support thus far, knowing that there are still areas for improvement in the alternative distribution of iOS apps.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic that, with continued cooperation from Apple and regulators, the business terms and user experience will continue to be improved in the coming months."</p>
<p>Aptoide will only focus on games for now, but may expand to other services on iOS in the future as Trezentos told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171037/aptoide-ios-game-store-eu-third-party-app-dma">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s all-new <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC is, in many ways, a showcase of everything this franchise could be at its absolute best. Some of its new systems, however, are still rather untested, with players being unsure what to make of them. Take the new Pathfinder system, for example.</p> <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">After you’ve taken down <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-defeat-the-witness-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the big bad of the DLC (for the first time)</a> and begun engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-patrols-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-campaign progression systems</a>, you will inevitably come across one of the several new Pathfinder interfaces strewn across the Director UI. Pathfinder is a one-size-fits-all Bounty replacement, providing a clear and pointed look at certain loot and currency items to prioritize. As shown in the screenshot below, it’s a neat and traditionally beautiful interface that sadly still needs work to truly come into its own. Here’s a brief rundown on why, and more of an in-depth look at how <em>The Final Shape’s Pathfinder </em>loot system works. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-finale-shape-s-pathfinder-loot-system-explained" data-injectable="false">The Finale Shape’s Pathfinder loot system explained</h2> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new Pathfinder feature gives you a wide overview of how to progress through your active Season Pass, earn a fair chunk of snazzy loot, and a non-insignificant amount of currency. You do so by completing your randomized array of objectives from left to right, and depending on which Pathfinder you open up, you’ll either be looking at location-specific objectives (i.e. Pale Heart missions) or activity-based ones, instead.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The good news is that Pathfinder saddles you with an impressively large number of different objectives. the Pale Heart Pathfinder specifically, for example, will send you off to take down world bosses, complete Lost Sectors, take down enemies in a particular way, help Ghosts in their plight, and a whole roster of other missions. It’s all good fun, especially when you can just complete one objective after the other without leaving the location at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The bad news, however, is that the activity Pathfinder handles this insistence on variety in a different way, and you’ll often need to jump from one playlist to the other to clear your tasks. In effect, this means you’ll often <em>have</em> to play PvP and/or Gambit PvPvE matches to actually unlock your Pathfinder Engrams.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Another slight downside to the Pathfinder loot system is that it’s not immediately obvious where to find it. Each interface is located in a different spot on the UI, so the Pale Heart’s Pathfinder is found in the upper left corner of the Pale Heart’s Director map, while the activity Pathfinder is in the Vanguard Director UI.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, only the Pale Heart and the core playlist activities have their own respective Pathfinders, but the system seems too comprehensive not to be applied to most major content releases moving forward. I recommend getting used to it, with that in mind. As outlined in the featured Reddit post, many players are still unsure how to feel about Pathfinder as a whole, but Bungie is bound to tune it up as time goes on, so improvements <em>should</em> be coming down the line.</p>

In much the same way as <em>The Final Shape</em> re-envisions tired old <em>Destiny</em> gameplay tropes, so too do Traveler’s Blessings find a new way to give you boons on the go. The bit that makes these destination mods interesting, for example, is that they’re quite powerful <em>but</em> also timed, which means you need to make good use of them while they’re active. Here’s how they work.</p>

Compared to most other destination mods we’ve seen in the past, they are often <em>extremely</em> powerful, offering effects such as the ability to spawn explosive Void seekers on Void-damage kills. Since they’re timed, of course, this has allowed Bungie to be more experimental in what it does to balance these out. Further, Traveler’s Blessings are available exclusively while exploring the Pale Heart, meaning their effects will not be relevant in the grander <em>Destiny 2</em> gameplay sandbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">You can find Traveler’s Blessings simply by interacting with the Pale Heart in as many ways as possible: complete mission objectives, open chests, collect the local resource nodes, and so on. Mods will drop at random, which means there’s no way of knowing which ones of these you may or may not get.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">Traveler’s Blessings are separated into two eight-item categories: the Flickering Blessings and the Pale Blessings. Flickering mods are player-applied, in that they only come into picture if the player triggers them to cause an effect in combat. Pale mods, on the other hand, are applied by interacting with the Traveler’s Flowers strewn across the Pale Heart, and they incur various survival and ability boons.</p>
 <h3 id="h-all-flickering-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Flickering Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Traveler’s Animus: Defeating a combatant has a chance to drop an Orb of Power or a random elemental Orb.</li> <li>Traveler’s Fervor: Sliding after sprinting for a short time sends out a burning line of fire in front of you, dealing Solar damage and incurring Scorched to affected enemies.</li> <li>Traveler’s Abundance: Defeating combatants with grenades has a chance to spawn Special ammo; defeating combatants with Super damage has a chance to spawn Heavy ammo.</li> <li>Traveler’s Transference: Sprinting for a short time applies Amplified; dealing melee damage to combatants while Amplified creates area-of-effect lightning bolts.</li> <li>Traveler’s Multiplicity: Finisher final blows convert your thrown grenade into an additional frag grenade.</li> <li>Traveler’s Diffraction: Defeating combatants with Void damage has a chance to spawn Void seeker rounds that seek out, damage, and Suppress other combatants.</li> <li>Traveler’s Proliferation: Defeating combatants with Strand damage spawns Threadlings; defeating Powerful combatants spawns multiple Threadlings at once.</li> <li>Traveler’s Sublimation: Rapidly defeating combatants with Stasis damage spawns a Stasis mine that damages and Freezes nearby combatants.</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-pale-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Pale Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li>Traveler’s Grace: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain the effect of another Traveler’s Blessing for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Insight: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Super ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Valor: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Melee ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Facet: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased class ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Resurgence: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Grenade ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Aegis: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain a regenerating Overshield for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Remedy: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased health regeneration for a limited time.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Each mod comes with its own timer, wherein some last 10 or 11 hours, while others might only stick around for 3 or 4 hours at a time. This, combined with the Traveler’s Blessings’ random drop nature is likely what has allowed Bungie to make them as potent as they are. So, make sure to use them when you’ve got ’em!</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">My recommendation is to activate one of each of these mods whenever you’re going off to try and farm Pale Heart gear, as it’s bound to make the whole thing that much easier for the next couple of hours. Provided, of course, that you actually <em>lean</em> into the active Traveler’s Blessings in the first place!</p>

            <p>
Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has announced a four-year licensing partnership with The Premier League.
</p>
<p>
It means, for the first time ever, Football Manager players will be able to take their team to the top of English football, with all 20 clubs fully licensed including official logos, kits, and player photos.
</p>
<p>
The deal will begin with the 2024/25 season, due later this year.

<p>
"Since Football Manager's inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we're delighted to announce today that at last we are", said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.
</p>
<p>
"The partnership isn't just about the huge in-game benefits it'll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we're enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.
</p>
<p>
"We are very grateful to the Premier League and their other partners in our space for enabling us to be an officially licensed product of the world's most commercially successful football league."
</p>
<p>
Premier League chief commercial officer Will Brass added: "Football Manager has been a big part of the sporting landscape for decades, and is loved and enjoyed by millions of fans around the world. We are thrilled that the Premier League will now feature even more prominently in the game, helping to deliver a deeper, more authentic experience for anybody who takes on the challenge of managing a Premier League club."
</p>
<p>
Football Manager first released in 2005, after its previous iteration as Championship Manager that began in 1992. It's surprising, therefore, it's taken so long for The Premier League to be officially licensed.
</p>
<p>
"What should be a transitional year for Football Manager feels like a quietly revolutionary one, thanks to a handful of little changes with big impacts," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-2024-review">Eurogamer's Football Manager 2024 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-nintendo-direct-this-week-journalist-claims-said-to-air-later-this-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There won't be a Nintendo Direct broadcast this week, a known Brazilian Journalist has claimed.</p>
<p>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, Nintendo won't be airing a new Direct episode later this week. Luckily for Nintendo fans, however, there will be a new Nintendo Direct later this month.<br>
At least, that's what known Brazilian journalist @phluttilippe <a href="https://x.com/phluttilippe/status/1800044165394497990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on X earlier today. Although the journalist has claimed that the Direct will take place by the end of the month, the exact date for the broadcast isn't certain at this point. "There is no Nintendo Direct this week", the journalist wrote on X (Google translated). "End of the month, and as far as I know, the exact date isn't even certain yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo President Furukawa confirmed that there will be a Direct broadcast this month. During this event, Nintendo won't be talking about the Switch 2. "We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation", Furukawa said last month.</p>
<p>While this isn't a confirmation that there indeed won't be a Direct this week, the journalist has correctly revealed Nintendo-related details before official announcements in the past. Also, @phluttilippe was among the first to say that the Switch successor is slated for a release in March 2025, instead of this year. Of course, Nintendo has yet to officially unveil the Switch successor, but Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Furukawa recently confirmed that the Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a> (before the end of Nintendo's current fiscal year, which runs through March 2025).</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Nintendo's plans for this month. Stay tuned.</p>

Harm to Snake’s body, including bruises and bullet wounds, as well as damage to his clothes, will be reflected in real time. “Any injuries to his actual body will leave their mark permanently,” reads the blurb, “telling a story of each player’s unique journey through the game.”</p><p>Despite the jokes about how messed up you will be able to make Snake look by the end of the game, players are genuinely excited about the feature, and especially how it feels so fitting to the franchise’s odd choices. <em>MGS</em> games are known for their weird design flourishes that seemingly have no real purpose beyond complexity. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> you can watch a cup of ice melt in real-time, and in the original <em>MGS3</em> you could win a fight against an aging sniper, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921">The End</a></span>, by simply waiting seven real-world days for him to die of old age. As absurd as these features may sometimes seem, they always add to the depth and immersion of the world. The upgraded damage system of <em>MGS Delta</em> feels like a logical next step for the series, and many see it as a truly Kojima-level choice.</p><p>As for how far the new damage system will go, Konami hasn’t given details on what to expect beyond what’s explained in the short blurb on the website. My best guess is that all damage taken by Snake will be able to be healed (this is a video game after all) but will leave a lasting scar, eventually creating a tapestry of mistakes or close calls with death unique to you. Maybe death will leave an exceptionally deep scar on Snake to remind you of when and why you failed. In any case, it’s a fascinating tease of what’s to come in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-veterans-announce-copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-and-the-first-from-new-studio-triple-espresso.896787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Triple Espresso, a brand new game development studio consisting of industry veterans, has announced its first title: <em>Copa City</em>. This game takes football management in a new direction, having you control everything about the city hosting the biggest clubs and matches in the world. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> combines the strategic elements of a tycoon simulator with the electric themes of football to create something that feels altogether new and interesting, much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-football-manager-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager</a></em> did when the very first entry was released. Just to be clear, this is soccer for you US folks, meaning you’ll be looking after all the hosting requirements and city management that come with major Premier League games and much from the same sport. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triple Espresso</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> is currently slated for a 2025 release window and is being developed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. During the campaign, you’ll manage real-world cities and six fully licensed football clubs playing in them. The clubs include Arsenal FC, FC Bayern Munchen, and CR Flamengo, so definitely some of the bigger names out there. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Your overarching goal with every match is to help the city gear up for the event and even get excited about it. This includes organizing how roadblocks must be set up, advertising, where fans can sit, and more. It reminds me a lot of the final match Leicester had to play in the Premier League in the 2015/16 season. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">The team was going to win the league regardless of the outcome, but more people watched it and were excited about it and the ensuring victory parade that occurred after than I’ve ever seen before. Everyone was talking about it, but the amount of management that must have gone into organizing every aspect of the match and everything that followed must have been monumental. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">I believe that’s the goal of <em>Copa City</em>: to put you in the shoes of the people working to facilitate that excitement in the best ways possible. You have all the responsibilities that come with keeping people and businesses in the city safe without all the team management, but you’re also rooting for one particular outcome so you can put on a fantastic show. </p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">The game is being developed by veterans from across the industry who have worked on titles such as <em>Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Dying Light 2</em>, and <em>Pure Farming 2018</em>, as well as football experts who have a wealth of knowledge to make the experience feel great for fans of football and strategy games alike. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://copacity.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copa City</a></em> is entering a space that the <em>Football Manager</em> and, to a degree, <em>EA Sports FC</em> have owned for over a decade. It’ll be interesting to see if it resonates with fans and can make a dent where fans love stats and want more management options at their fingertips. </p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been following along with the development of <em>Stalker 2</em>, you’ll be well aware of the turmoil the studio has had to endure. With GSC Game World having to flee to Prague to escape the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the future of the long-awaited horror FPS remained uncertain at one point.</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">We know it had to be delayed for fairly obvious reasons, pushing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-september-5-2024/">release date back to September 5</a>. Now, the latest trailer has been released, and it’s really whetting my appetite for <em>Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Трейлер «Час Можливостей»" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6HH5kKLAlw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">The gloomy backdrop of the Exclusion Zone has never looked prettier than in the “Time of Opportunities” teaser the developer put out yesterday. While many of us strongly suspect <em>Stalker 2</em> is going to be quite something, I now cannot wait for it to finally arrive.</p> <h2 id="h-heart-and-soul" data-injectable="false">Heart and soul</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say I was ignorant of the game until now. Though I admit, I haven’t really played any of the other entries in the series, aside from a brief stint of the first game. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t intrigued me, largely because it’s been fifteen years since GSC released the last installment, <em>Call of Pripyat</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">At any rate, the new trailer really shows off what’s almost certainly going to be a pretty solid horror FPS. I know I’m not alone in saying that it gives me mad <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800/Chernobylite_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chernobylite</a></em> vibes, which I have played and did enjoy.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false">It has, indeed, been a long and worrisome road for the development team, but whatever tribulations have come their way, they’ve remained steadfast in their completion of <em>Stalker 2</em>. I truly hope it pays off for them, because it looks fantastic. Look, just go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlist the game on Steam</a> already.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-it-worth-pulling-stringmaster-without-yinlin-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-it-worth-pulling-stringmaster-without-yinlin-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With Yinlin’s release in <em>Wuthering Waves, </em>came her signature weapon, Stringmaster, a 5-Star Rectifier with a lot of power behind it. If you’re curious about pulling Stringmaster without getting Yinlin, or if you’re wondering if you should even pull the weapon at all, then I’ve got all that you need to know right here.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-rolling-for-stringmaster-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Is it worth rolling for Stringmaster in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">The short and sweet answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. Stringmaster is an insanely powerful 5-Star Rectifier that completely dwarfs its standard counterpart, Cosmic Ripples, in all aspects except for raw ATK%. It makes up for its lack of ATK% main stat with a CRIT RATE main stat instead, and that makes it absurdly universal for any characters that use Rectifiers for damage. To put that statement into a reasonable perspective,<strong> </strong>Stringmaster is <strong>Encore’s BiS (Best in Slot) </strong>weapon as of Yinlin’s release, and it’s not even close.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">As a stat stick, Stringmaster is already a pretty insane weapon, coming with a CRIT RATE stat that scales higher than any other CRIT RATE weapon in the game. However, Stringmaster’s passive ability also provides a significant damage boost to any character that makes use of their Resonance Skill as a primary aspect for dishing out damage. This, again, is why characters like Encore want Stringmaster so badly.</p>

There’s also an equally high chance that his new theoretical Rectifier will be just as strong or stronger than Stringmaster. However, looking at Stringmaster as a whole, its high innate CRIT RATE always gives it a potent niche for characters to abuse. Even if it’s knocked down a peg or two, this weapon will never be outright useless in my opinion. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Even if Stringmaster is eventually outclassed by another 5-Star Rectifier, it will likely remain the second-best choice for a long time for most DPS-focused Rectifier characters. Stringmaster’s mixture of universal useful stats and powerful passive ability that all characters can make use of make it a very safe pick for players looking to pick up an additional 5-Star Rectifier for their arsenals.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, thanks to the weapon banner being a guaranteed pick of your choice, weapons actually have a slightly higher value than characters from an account overview standpoint in terms of account progression. The reason is that 4-Star weapons, in general, are far weaker than practically any 5-Star weapon you can obtain. This intrinsically boosts the value of pulling Stringmaster from Yinlin’s banner, as the more 5-Star weapons you have on your account, the better off your characters will be, especially since you can freely swap around weapons and gear during <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>endgame content, Tower of Adversity.</p>

		<p>Football Manager 2025 will have the official license for the Premier League for the first time, as the Premier League and Sports Interactive have penned a four-year licensing partnership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Premier League Licence coming to Football Manager" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rircYvbkhk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the 2024/25 season, Football Manager will have all 20 Premier League clubs included with fully licensed logos, kits and player photos for the real sporting figures throughout.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, “Since Football Manager’s inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we’re delighted to announce today that at last we are.”</p>
<p>This will add a further layer of authenticity to the game, though it already has numerous leagues, teams and competitions licensed – in England, for example, the Premier League is the cherry on the top of having the EFL and National League structures in <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-2024-licences">FM24</a>, and there’s several of the major European leagues and the UEFA club competitions already featured as well.</p>

<p>Jacobson continued:</p>
<p>“The partnership isn’t just about the huge in-game benefits it’ll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we’re enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.”</p>
<p>More details on how the Premier League will be integrated into Football Manager will be revealed later this year, as and when Sports Interactive start to talk about this year’s entry.</p>
<p>However, we do know that this year’s game is going to be a massive shift for Sports Interactive. The studio confirmed last year that they would be switching game engines to Unity, which will allow for a whole new UI, better optimised graphics per platform – from mobile to console and PC – and a completely overhauled matchday experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">FM24</a> was the first time that you were able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/football-manager-2024-will-support-football-manager-23-saves/">import a previous year’s save</a> and continue on with the new enhancements and systems, and we expect that this will also be possible with FM25. It’s also been a few years since Sports Interactive announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/23/womens-football-is-coming-to-football-manager-not-for-2022/">their intention to bring women’s football into Football Manager</a> with a number of specific and bespoke touches to try to accurately simulate the women’s game and the different challenges it can present when compared to the men’s game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>developer Sports Interactive has announced that it's secured a four-year licensing deal with the Premier League, the biggest league in English football.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the football (if you're expecting me to call it "soccer", you're out of luck) management sim will include all 20 Premier League clubs starting from the 2024/25 season.</p>
<p>Those clubs will come complete with their official logos, player lineups, and kits, and you'll also see authentic player photos for each player, bringing you that much closer to your dream of being a Premier League manager.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=HPr8PJQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=INUTjCh9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Premier League is officially coming to&nbsp;<em>Football Manager </em>for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>While individual teams such as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion or Manchester City have featured as licenses in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>games, they were usually included as part of other leagues or tournaments.</p>
<p>This deal marks the first time the full Premier League has been available in a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>game, and given that many of the series' players likely hail from the UK, this is a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson says it's always been his studio's dream to work with the Premier League, and he's "delighted" that the deal has finally come to pass.</p>
<p>Premier League CCO Will Brass, for his part, says&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>represents a "big part of the sporting landscape", and that the inclusion of the Premier League in the game will help to "deliver a deeper, more authentic experience".</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a football management sim series that's been running since 1992 in one form or another.</p>
<p>The series debuted as&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager</em>, but became&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>after the controversial release of 2003's&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager 4</em>, which saw developer Sports Interactive switch to Sega for future series installments (as well as the name change).</p>
<p><em>Championship Manager&nbsp;</em>continued in various forms for a number of years, but no new games have been released in that franchise for a while, leaving&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>at the top of its rather lonely league table.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-preview-and-qa-wide-linear-soulslite-with-20-hours-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, the next game from New Zealand developer Aurora44 (the same studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ashen-not-dark-but-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashen</a>), finally got its release date announcement during yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase: the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on July 18.</p>
<p>With only a month and a week left before the release date, we were able to get our hands on a demo of the game that goes live today on Steam Next Fest. Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn definitely shares quite a few similarities with the studio's previous work, being a Souls-lite action RPG with adventure elements.</p>
<p>However, the setting is certainly unique. This is a fantasy world where magic and the gods are very much real; in fact, the so-called Gods of the Great Below assault the living world with their armies of undead. This is when the demo and, indeed, the whole game begins.</p>
<p>Protagonist Nor Vanek (played by Olive Gray) is an orphan adopted into the Coalition Army, the defensive force that fights desperately against the invasion of the Gods. She was trained as a Sapper from a young age under the tutelage of Baz, a grizzled war veteran who is essentially her adoptive father. At the very beginning of the game, Baz (played by Elias Toufexis of Deus Ex fame) goes with a couple of squad members on a nearly suicidal mission to try and bomb the gate of the dead once and for all. Nor is initially left behind but quickly joins the group when she learns of their arduous task. A big creature eventually ambushes the party and, in the hectic fight, Nor does something to the gate that actually makes things worse for everyone.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14_Game_Screen_Combat_Traveller_Boss-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, shortly afterward, she gains a companion in Enki, a fox-like creature who turns out to be a minor god himself. Enki (played by Alistair Petrie) warns Nor of the dire situation the whole world is in and offers his help in defeating the other gods. Enki's powers include the ability to curse enemies, for instance to fill the priming gauge with successful melee attacks to trigger an instant takedown of an unarmored enemy, and the Witherings, powerful attacks that consume the Withering gauge, which gets filled by defeating enemies). Enki (who's not nearly as chatty as Forspoken's Cuff, in case you were worried) can also help with rift-based magic traversal that allows Nor to reach otherwise inaccessible paths.</p>
<p>This is often where you'll find secondary content, such as Enki's feathers, which can be collected to augment the companion's power level, or even hamlets that need to be freed from the enemy's yoke. In this case, you can head directly to the enemy leader - once defeated, all the other enemies will disappear, restoring the original population to unlock a reward, a secondary quest, and the ability to play the mini-game called Sebo.</p>
<p>Speaking of combat, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a relatively fast-paced soulslite that feels fun but not overly complex to play. As suggested by the title, there's a fairly strong emphasis on firearms. With your gamepad's right trigger, you can use black power charges (recharged by landing successful melee attacks) to deal damage and stop certain enemy attacks. These can be woven into melee combo chains. Players can also equip up to two secondary firearms to be aimed and reloaded with their own ammunition. There's even a Gears of War-like active reload system that rewards a properly timed reload with increased damage on the next shot. Grenades are also available when you need to deal area of effect damage.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FLINTLOCK_Gameplay_SCREENSHOT_UHD_003-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, much of the game still involves melee attacks, blocks, and parries. Holding the left shoulder button enters a blocking stance, but only pressing the block button right after being hit will parry the attack, allowing players to execute a melee counter-attack. There's also a double dodge for when you really need to get out of the way of an unblockable attack. Each combat action builds Reputation, which is the game's primary currency.</p>
<p>In an intriguing twist, you can either 'bank it' right away or grow up your Reputation multiplier; do note that being hit automatically resets the multiplier and banks the Reputation. Of course, if you are defeated, the Reputation is lost and you'll have one chance to get it back, just like in a proper Soulslike game. You'll respawn at the nearest Lodestone, the equivalent of a bonfire in a Souls game. You can rest here (which respawns enemies, of course), as well as check your inventory and skills. Players must spend Reputation to unlock new skills in the three available trees (Powder, which increases ranged damage; Magic, which augments magic damage; and Steel, which bolsters melee damage).</p>
<p>Visually, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn features some of New Zealand's native plants and trees. The developers said some of the game's fauna is a tribute to the Moa bird. Moreover, the Three Peaks area is heavily inspired by New Zealand's South Island regions. The landscape of this region is modeled after the Southern Alps. The game (powered by Unreal Engine 4) looks good without being spectacular. On PC, it already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (with a slider to tweak the sharpness) and Frame Generation, as well as Intel XeSS. AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution is strangely missing from this build, although XeSS is available cross-vendor, so that wouldn't be too much of an issue. However, there's quite a bit of stuttering that I certainly hope will be fixed or at least lessened before the full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn PC Preview 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YU-9QS-mN8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn feels like a competent and fun soulslite that is, however, unlikely to stand out from the crowd for its quality. Still, the budget pricing ($40, with a 10% discount currently available ahead of launch) and the day-one availability on Game Pass make it an enticing title for anyone interested in the genre and setting.</p>

  <p id="yG2wxz"><em>One of the best parts of the human experience is having a </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes"><em>big ol’ crush</em></a><em> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affections, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” Brief-yet-intense infatuations </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade"><em>don’t necessarily have to be on real people</em></a><em> (or even on people!), or even romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</em></p>

<p id="sVZj4q">The 2000 animated Disney direct-to-video comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/28/18261900/best-disney-sequels-movies-animation"><em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em></a> is back in the zeitgeist at the moment. There’s been a sudden wave of fan-created <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shibah_art/video/7371104206431784198">animatics</a> of Goofy’s son <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/photo/7369081209130896656">Max and his rival</a>, the skateboarding frat boy Bradley Uppercrust III, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7370868918186937616">flooding</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7367711589648157968">TikTok</a>. Their relationship even clocked in at No. 6 on last week’s <a href="https://fandom.tumblr.com/post/752293738864361472/movies">Tumblr Fandometric ranking for movies</a>, with the tag full of <a href="https://silkoodles.tumblr.com/post/752056220985311232/from-this-gif-set-i-just-love-when-a-decades-old">romantic fan art</a>. Most of the resurgence is focused on the “Maxley” ship between Max and Bradley, and it’s clear what’s driving that: There’s an enduring appeal in an enemies-to-lovers pairing. And some of these edits also toss in some queer longing to really drive up the drama. </p>
<p id="bCqNux">But personally, when I think of <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em>, the first thing that comes to mind is Beret Girl. </p>

<p id="IUdOhJ">Goofy’s son Max and his pals first meet the mysterious, never named beret-clad gal when she performs a slam poem at some hip café. But that isn’t her most awesome moment. After Bradley gets aggressive with Max at her show, she swoops in to put Bradley in his place, getting the entire café to aggressively snap at him until he and his cronies leave. She’s striking and creative and has a killer sense of fashion, with her commitment to the all-black look and that sultry purple eyeliner. </p>
<p id="SlX84n">Since Beret Girl isn’t credited with an actual name, many <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dawn.kirkland/video/7293214379510680874">Disney fans</a> have decided her name is Mocha Chino, since Bradley calls her “little Miss Mochaccino” to dismiss her. But that does make for a pretty sick name, so we’re reclaiming it from Bradley! </p>
<p id="0symRn">When I first watched this movie as a kid in the early 2000s, it gave me completely unrealistic expectations for how cool college would be. Namely that there would be artsy spoken-word poetry events in underground cafés, campus librarians would be into disco, and everyone would be <em>really</em> invested in skateboarding. (Maybe this was true in the year 2000, but it wasn’t true a decade later.) But Beret Girl gave me <em>the</em> most unrealistic expectation: that there would be beautiful, rhyming black-clad girls around to chew out all the douchey frat boys.</p>

<p id="LAq3pM">Rewatching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em> today is a fun nostalgia trip, and the current wave of TikToks and Tumblr art has reminded me that there definitely is a lot of homoerotic tension going on with Max and Bradley. I love that people are rewatching or discovering the film, and finding joy in giving Bradley and Max’s antagonistic relationship a flirtatious and romantic edge. </p>
<p id="IqbLuH">But personally, I’m still out here replaying Beret Girl’s two minutes of screen time over and over and over again. Suddenly, I’m back in third grade, watching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie </em>in class, because we had a substitute teacher without a lesson plan. And this super cool, confident, artsy girl takes center stage, commanding a room with her presence. She makes an impression! I latched on to how cool she was at age 8, and I never fully let go, even if that kinda evolved from wanting to hang out with her to wanting to be her to wanting to hold her hand and have her defend me from Bradley Uppercrust III. </p>
<p id="t6iuon">Once again, I am doomed to love a background character this week. Maybe next time I’ll find a worthy crush in a main character. Hopefully you’re having a better time of it than I am. Let me know who you’re crushing on!</p>
