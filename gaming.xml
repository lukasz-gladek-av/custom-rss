<p>This follows an update in September and comes loaded with general updates and multiple fixes. It also makes some changes to Drag x Drive: Global Jam. It's been renamed the Drag x Drive Demo and certain bot games can be played at any time now.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive - Version 1.2.0 (Released 1st December, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0jvhzio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/</link>
            <guid>1370026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Hideo Kojima, the legendary game creator, has joined the cast of Zootopia 2 to provide a Japanese dub for Paul Moldebrandt, a mole who works in the Zootopia Police Department. His cameo appearance reportedly comes after he was directly approached by Jared Bush, the film’s director, to request his voiceover talents.</p>



<p>Zootopia 2 is set to hit screens in just a few days, launching on Friday, December 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unexpected-cameo">An Unexpected Cameo</h2>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Famitsu</a>, Hideo Kojima expressed his delight at being invited to voice a character in Zootopia 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have plenty of experience with cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this will be my first time dubbing an animated feature film. And it’s from Disney, to my surprise!</p>



<p>And since it came directly from director Jared Bush, I was incredibly honored and accepted without hesitation</p>



<p>My participation was limited to a small scene, but even at the recording stage, the level of detail was impressive. Thanks to the illustrations, the recording went smoothly. I’m usually on the directing side, so I learned a lot from actually acting. I was reminded of how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning pages in the script and adding noise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kojima said, this isn’t his first time acting. He has appeared in a few small roles over the years, most notably in Cyberpunk 2077 and Control. He also assumed roles in Metal Gear Solid games and has made cameos in Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The report from Famitsu suggests that Kojima was a huge fan of the first Zootopia movie, released in 2016, and when he saw it, he was left wondering how they could ‘surpass’ it with a sequel.</p>







<p>Do you plan to watch the Japanese version of Zootopia 2 just to catch Kojima’s cameo? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="dbf01f2788a01"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf01f2788a01/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't already got a Switch 2 and happen to be located in the US, the bundle deal including a download copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has gone on sale for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>This bundle deal is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy for <strong>$449</strong> instead of the usual $499, so you're saving $50. This is the first time the bundle has been on sale in this location and gives you access to the new entry in the Mario Kart series at no extra cost (instead of having to fork out extra).</p>
<p>A regular Switch 2 bundle is normally priced at $449, so this current offer on the Mario Kart World bundle brings it down to the same price. Nintendo also previously mentioned how the Mario World Bundle would be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-will-be-a-limited-time-offer">"limited time production" through to Fall 2025</a> in the US and is available "while supplies last".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has only recently passed the six-month mark in its life, and Nintendo has not officially discounted or reduced the price of the new unit, so this latest offer might be worth considering if you were hoping to save some coin.</p>

This model includes the new Shield Remote, offering backlit buttons, a built-in microphone for voice commands, and even a lost remote locator feature (so you'll know exactly which cushion it slipped behind). The main attraction, however, is the box itself, which features some nice hardware. Here's a quick look at its specs:</p><ul><li>Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor (256-core GPU and 3GB RAM)</li><li>16GB storage (expandable)</li><li>AI-upscaling for 4K 60fps</li><li>Dolby Atmos support</li><li>Dolby Vision support</li><li>Gigabit Ethernet port</li><li>HDMI 2.0</li><li>2x USB 3.0 Ports (Type A)</li><li>Android 11 with Chromecast 4K built-in</li></ul><p>For gaming, you'll have access to Google Play Games and GeForce Now. That makes this a pretty cool central entertainment hub, offering you a chance to stream not just TV shows and movies, but also games.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you like the concept of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro but want to save a few extra bucks, take a peek at its more affordable sibling--the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Streaming-Performance-Assistant-945-13430-2500-000/dp/B07YP94PBJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia Shield TV</a>. It comes with a similar Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor, though it's equipped with 2GB RAM instead of 3GB. You'll also lose out on the USB 3.0 ports and see a drop from 16GB of storage to just 8GB. However, at $125 (was $150), it might be a good choice for frugal shoppers.</p><p>Another cloud gaming option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max + Luna Controller Bundle</a>, which is on sale for $70 (was $130) at Amazon. The Luna Controller is surprisingly great--especially when streaming with Luna--as it helps reduce input latency and is quite comfortable for extended gaming sessions. Note that these Fire TV Sticks all support Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>If you're not interested in cloud gaming, you can save even more by opting for a media streamer device without the gaming capabilities. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-newest-AI-powered-Search-million/dp/B0F7Z4QZTT?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Plus</a> is just $25 (was $50), while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> is $35 (was $60). Both obviously support 4K output, but the Max gets you an additional 8GB of storage, features the Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced, and offers the Fire TV Ambient Experience when you're not actively streaming.

Along with serving as a Bluetooth speaker, you can customize the pixel art on its display using the attached mini keypad. There's also a companion app where you can quickly adjust your settings--or download artwork from other users. So even if you're not the most artistic person on the planet, you can still get a fun design for the speaker.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>For playing music, you can connect via Bluetooth, USB, or microSD card. Beyond looking adorably retro and blasting tunes, the device also works as a white noise machine, a timer, and an alarm clock with 12 wake-up sounds. And since it gets around 8 hours of battery life on a charge, you can use it throughout your home before needing to plug in at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4613206" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4613206"></a><figcaption>Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speakers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg"></figure><p>The same company responsible for the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker also makes a few other cool speakers. A cheaper alternative is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRFDY837?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic Gaming PC Style Speaker</a>, which is just $56 (was $70). It's designed to look like (surprise!) a retro computer, though its display isn't designed for pixel art. Instead, you can use it as a digital picture frame. There's also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Timebox-Portable-Bluetooth-Programmable/dp/B07H7L1PLD?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TimeBox Evo</a>, which offers a similar pixel grid as that of the Retro Pixel Art Speaker, but it's housed inside a minimalist black frame. It's available for $38.20 (was $70).</p><p>Looking for a Bluetooth speaker that's a bit more traditional? The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Max-Alexa-Speaker-Graphite-Amazon/dp/B0D6SX8VLQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Dot Max</a> is on sale for $90 (was $100), and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Dot</a> is just $32 (was $50). The former features a built-in 0.8-inch tweeter and 2.5-inch woofer, while the latter comes with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker. The Echo Dot Max is a better choice for large spaces, though the affordable Echo Dot will work just fine for a home office or bedroom.</p><p>Be sure to also check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday Deals Hub</a> to see even more discounts available before the sale ends.</p><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upgrade-nintendo-switch-2-storage-with-steeply-discounted-samsung-512gb-microsd-express/1100-6530578/">Last Chance To Get Cyber Monday Deals On MicroSD Express Cards For Switch 2</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controllers-on-sale-for-black-friday/1100-6536412/">DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/">Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-switch-exclusive-game-deals/1100-6536453/">Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Sony's hit video game franchise Helldivers is heading to the big screen, and it'll be driven by the man who directed five out of the 10 Fast &amp; Furious movies: Justin Lin.</p><p>And the project has already lined up a screenwriter as well: Gary Dauberman, a writer whose experience includes the It movies and the Annabelle films.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lin will produce the movie through his Perfect Storm Entertainment company. The story also notes that Lin used his inexperience as a gamer as a way to pitch Sony on a take that will "find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology."</p><p>Lin has been credited with reviving the Fast &amp; Furious films with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. While that movie was a success, he led the franchise to even bigger hits with Fast &amp; Furious, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, and F9: The Fast Saga. Lin's lone sci-fi film was 2016's Star Trek Beyond. Lin is also signed to adapt the One-Punch Man manga and anime as a movie.</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers/" data-ref-id="5000-192301">Helldivers</a> game debuted in 2015, but its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a>, has proven to be even more successful across consoles and PC. The game casts players Helldivers, an elite group of soldiers who strive to protect Super Earth from enemy factions including Bugs, Cyborgs, and Illuminate. It's proven to be a hit on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>Sony's PlayStation Productions banner has had success on the big screen with Uncharted, the film adaptation of Naughty Dog's action-adventure series. The company is also producing The Legend of Zelda movie in conjunction with Nintendo. On television, Sony's The Last of Us and Twisted Metal have both been renewed by HBO and Peacock, respectively.</p>

		<p>There was a moment over the weekend, huddled up in rural Wisconsin, where it became clear we weren't heading home anytime soon. The snow plows had come by once or twice for the streets directly outside our place—and then stopped. I mean, they had better places to be, roads where more people would be traveling. But it also was the strongest signal that maybe we shouldn't rush back and instead spend the day largely indoors. It was delightful, honestly, with my wife and I reading on the couch, college football humming in the background, while my two children spent hours doing holiday crafts with their grandma.

<section><p>We played six hours of the DLC and spoke to the game's director to find out what's new.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">From Software is very careful about setting expectations when it comes to the DLC expansions for its games, favoring the underpromise and overdeliver approach. This much is reflected in the messaging around The Forsaken Hollows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s first DLC expansion. When I pointed out a similarity I felt it had to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, the team made sure to clarify that the comparison was not quite apt and players shouldn't expect something on that level.</p><p dir="ltr">The Forsaken Hollows is billed as a couple of new Nightfarers for players to pick between, along with new points of interest to give players a reason to jump back into Limveld and take on the Nightlords. That's an accurate summation of it, but also somewhat undersells that the two new Nightfarers are <em>very</em> cool and create interesting new ways to think about and play the game; the new biomes come in the form of swamps (yes, they're back) that make the threat of status effects more prominent; and there are multiple new mini-bosses and third-day bosses to take on.</p><p dir="ltr">But the real underselling pertains to the new Shifting Earth event, which is essentially a brand new map that's distinct from Limveld, as opposed to a much smaller scale change in the environment that we're used to expecting.</p><p dir="ltr">So, not expecting too much is indeed good advice. However, at the same time, what I thought The Forsaken Hollows is going to be and what it actually is caught me off guard in the same way the unexpectedly expansive nature of Shadow of the Erdtree did. And when I finished my hands-on time with it, I left with a reinvigorated interest in Nightreign.</p><p dir="ltr">Before delving into the nitty-gritty details with From Software, I wanted to understand what the studio thought of the reception to its first multiplayer-focused title. From has been very open that Nightreign was and is a game that was intentionally designed and developed under stringent conditions; namely time and money spent. That it has been so transparent about this has been interesting to me, particularly when it comes to whether the studio believes this was a successful endeavor.</p><div tabindex="0"

"I would say it's definitely a success from that standpoint. I think that the overall gameplay has been well received as well, and we were kind of surprised to see the players' interpretations of the relationship between the main characters and how they're all friendly and nice with each other, which--when we were developing [the game]--we didn't really consider. So it's fun to see that the users have made their own version of it."</p><p dir="ltr">The From Software community being able to connect dots in unexpected ways shouldn't come as a surprise, as it's very much par for the course for a group of fans that is always reading between the lines. What caught me off guard, however, was how there wasn't a more pronounced backlash to what was in the game, given that, well, it's a pretty obvious asset flip in so many ways. Despite this, the focus of discussion has been around how From's considered mechanics and delicately paced and balanced design have been contorted into something that feels unnatural, but is compelling nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, it may not strike you as surprising that The Forsaken Hollows isn't replete with brand new, unique to Nightreign content; it is very much taking what exists and finding different angles on them or delving into the studio's history to pull from its larger catalog of games for some surprises.</p><p dir="ltr">Take the Scholar and the Undertaker, for example. These two new Nightfarers, on paper, don't seem particularly exciting--not to me anyway. However, in both cases, just a few minutes of time with them quickly opened my eyes to the potential they have to drastically shift the dynamics of play between Nightfarers and also against the challenges Limveld presents.</p><p dir="ltr">Scholar, for example, feels like he's a bit of a liability to begin with. His function in battle initially seems to be standing at a safe distance and applying buffs and/or debuffs that may contribute to giving the group an edge. And that much is true. His Character Skill is called Analyze, and lets him swap from wielding a weapon to surveying the battlefield using a large circle that can be aimed to try and capture multiple enemies within its scope of effect. The longer the Scholar can keep targets--both friendly and non-friendly--in his view, the more buffs and debuffs stack. And the closer he is to the target, the quicker the analysis will move up the three levels of potency. At level one, his buff increases his own stamina, but push through to level three, and he will create a barrier that activates a shockwave when hit. On the other hand, a level one debuff decreases an enemy's attack power, but get to level three and the next hit they take will be more damaging.</p><p dir="ltr">His Passive Skill, meanwhile, is called Bagcraft, and it lets the Scholar pocket more items. If you're a seasoned Nightreign player, you'll know that most items outside of gear loot are usually not worth the time, effort, or potential danger they may leave you in when gathering supplies. Because of this, most players sprint past the vast majority of items in Limveld. The Scholar, however, is designed to encourage players to engage with this overlooked system by offering meaningful upgrades to items. Consumable stacks are increased thanks to Bagcraft and, by using items, the Scholar gains experience in that particular category of item. Over time, this levels up what they can do or how much impact they have. Usually, the first level up boosts an item's strength or effectiveness, while the second can add a secondary effect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612758-elden2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612758" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612758-elden2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612758"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612758-elden2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The amount of uses it takes to level up an item category varies, but all items in that category will contribute to its growth. This means that you can lob any and all flavors of pots and they will all benefit from the levels you gain. Naturally, we didn't have enough time to test all the items and how they change, but we were able to give darts secondary attributes, give pots a greater area of effect, and make healing items more potent. Couple this new system with relics that let the Scholar start a run with consumables in his pocket and you can quickly get the jumpstart on the leveling-up process.</p><p dir="ltr">What's interesting from a gameplay dynamic perspective is that, in many ways, the team needs to accept that the Scholar may not be a very effective contributor in the early phases of a Nightreign run owing to its split focus. While the other members of the team may be focused on sprinting to points of interest to get more flasks, find gear, or gather experience, the Scholar needs to gather less-than-useful items and focus on spamming them at every opportunity which, often, isn't exactly helpful. However, the flipside of that is that, if done smartly, the Scholar's late-game contributions can be significant both in terms of offense and defense. In my experience, I found the team's survivability was much better in fights on day three and against <em>some</em> Nightlords. The Tricephalos, for example, becomes far less frightening when it splits into three when you have the Scholar, who can, with good positioning and careful timing, analyze them simultaneously and debuff them.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scholar's Ultimate Art is called Communion, and it links all nearby enemies and allies together, so damage dealt to one enemy will also transfer over to other enemies linked to it. Any healing items used in the area around the Scholar are also shared between all Nightfarers. Together, these skills make Communion a very powerful skill that, if used properly, can be used to manage multi-enemy bosses and mob groups of enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">That kind of sacrifice-now-and-benefit-later dynamic is really interesting and trades off trusting that your Scholar knows what they're doing. It also demands patience and strategy from all members of the party, making it a quintessentially From Software design.</p><p dir="ltr">The Undertaker is a far more aggressive addition to the roster, feeling close to Wylder in terms of offensive potential and movement capabilities. The Undertaker is crucial to putting out big damage fast, and making the most of how and when fellow Nightfarers use their ultimates. On a basic level, she is most proficient in using hammers thanks to an A in scaling for faith and strength. She has a B in health scaling and a C in FP and stamina. The latter of those three attributes is what governs the push and pull between her offense and defense. She can get in and do a lot of damage, but without close regulation of what she's doing, she could also find herself in danger without the ability to escape.</p><p dir="ltr">However, her character skill, Trance, is a tool in her arsenal that can provide some utility in situations just like that. "Bloodletting triggers the power of the loathsome hex," reads its description. That basically means that, when she pops it, her running speed increases and she can move at the same speed as the sprint without consuming stamina. Additionally, her toughness and combo attack power both rise, while her dodge becomes a dodge step. If her ultimate art is ready to be used, she can instead opt to consume it, improving her attack power and movement speed, and also dodge one lethal blow, much like Wylder. The interesting twist is that when she uses this skill, it also instantly refills her stamina, so it can be used to apply a lot of pressure to enemies and potentially push them into a staggered state.</p><p dir="ltr">Her aforementioned ultimate is called Loathsome Hex and during it she slingshots herself towards whatever direction the player chooses--and towards an enemy if locked on--to attack with an uncanny bone she has pulled from her own body. It's a very fast, flashy, and powerful attack that can turn the tide very quickly, either by doing good damage to an enemy, or if used on a downed ally, helping get them back in the fight quicker. It can also be executed in mid-air, giving it some versatility in timing and range, if combined with jumps. The one thing to be aware of, however, is that obstacles in its path can stop the Undertaker in her tracks, wasting the ultimate entirely. This means you have to be very careful and confident when initiating it.</p><p dir="ltr">The real fun, however, happens when you take into account Confluence, the Undertaker's passive ability--undoubtedly the most fun, momentum-shifting ability in the game. Whenever any other Nightfarer activates their ultimate, the Undertaker has a very brief window to use Loathsome Hex for free, which means when it's done, you'll still have your own ultimate if it was charged or retain the progress towards getting it. With two other Nightfarers beside you and some good communication, you can unleash as many as five ultimates with the Undertaker on the team. And if you decided to run a team comp that has two Undertakers (which is very viable, based on my experience), the damage potential there is very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a really satisfying synergy built into both of the new Nightfarers that, I think, isn't present to the same extent in the original group. This means that my brief time with The Forsaken Hollows was filled with non-stop chatter as we tried to time our abilities together, and some thrilling sequences where we were able to bring once difficult mini-bosses to their knees with relative ease.</p><p dir="ltr">"That is definitely something that has been on the forefront of our minds from the very start of development; trying to figure out how we can get players not only to work together, but almost work on top of each other," Ishizaki explained. "We're not just necessarily going at it and seeing what characters can work well together, but what characters can work well by themselves, [and] also in combination with other characters.</p><p dir="ltr">"So there definitely is a sort of synergetic way of looking at it, and that's where a lot of the ideas originally stemmed from--trying to figure out where they can fit into the ultimate equation with other characters."</p><p dir="ltr">The big question, however, is how well this is all going to be balanced. And that's something that, according to Ishizaki, was a challenge with the base game and continues to be a challenge as the team prepares to launch more content that will be enjoyed by casual players as well as a community that expects the difficulty to scale up to test their mastery.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612763-elden6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612763" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612763-elden6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612763"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4612763-elden6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki said. "I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilize the new balancing that we are working with.</p><p dir="ltr">"Obviously, we don't want it to be so hard that new players can't get into it, but I think the original idea is that when the game initially had come out, there were even players who are veterans of some of the other games trying to figure out the new systems, trying to figure out how the game works. I think [we want our] ideas when we're working on the DLC content to be a reflection of that. So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out. [The Forsaken Hollows is] definitely a little bit harder, but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">While the big draw of The Forsaken Hollows is definitely the new characters and location, From has done some tweaking to the original Limveld map, most notably changing certain areas so they present more of a threat, while also feeding into the risk-versus-reward calculation. Longtime From Software fans will have to accept that the inevitable has happened and swamps have been introduced to achieve this. Now, areas of Limveld will have swamps that inflict poison, scarlet rot, frenzy, and other ailments if they're not navigated properly. Staying true to classic Swamp Software design principles, wading into a swamp will slow walking speed down drastically and if you don't get out of whatever horrible liquid you're knee deep in, a bar builds up until that ailment is inflicted on the player.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the time, however, pushing through will yield a weapon of that same attribute, which means they're worth visiting if you have a strategy that involves exploiting boss weaknesses or inflicting certain attributes on them. Of course, I took the opportunity to ask Ishizaki about this obsession with swamps that has become a lighthearted meme in the From Software fan community, and clear up once and for all if Hidetaka Miyazaki has a swamp mandate for the studio's games.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme. It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realize] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own," Ishizaki said.</p><p dir="ltr">"The main game for Nightreign did not have a swamp, so I do see what you mean now, having it added after the fact with the DLC. But yeah, it's definitely one of those things that [it] always just seems like [our game] ends up with a swamp. Even if there's not a specific rule like, 'Oh yeah, we have to put that in there,' [that's] just always how it kind of ends up."</p><p dir="ltr">Another new addition to the Limveld is the presence of forges that can be found in parts of the map and cleared of enemies, activating them. This item can then be used at a forge to re-roll an attribute on a weapon, so if you've got a weapon you like that doesn't have much utility beyond smashing or slicing enemies with, you can head to a forge, try your luck, and hope you walk away with something you're more excited about. Again, it's not a major change, but it adds to the risk-versus-reward dynamic in a way that is just useful enough to entice some tense expeditions now and then.</p><p dir="ltr">The main event, as mentioned, is the Shifting Earth event. In The Forsaken Hollows, however, this involves gliding into a new location called The Great Hollows, where expansive fields, derelict shacks, and crumbled ruins are replaced by a landscape that is something closer to the Ashen Capital, but with the vibe and underground feel of Nokron, Eternal City or Ainsel River, with the Nightreign spin of the aesthetics. The area is covered with what looks like a thick layer of white ash, but large formations of crystals are also a regular sight. In some areas, you may encounter a Crystal Curse, requiring you to engage in a side-mission to acquire a status effect that makes you immune to this, while in others the biggest danger is an errant jump or poorly timed sprint. And you will be jumping more than you might think because a key design principle of The Great Hollows is verticality.</p><p dir="ltr">There are deep mines that you can fall into, but also precarious platforming demands that will have you walking along planks suspended above dilapidated cathedrals nestled in underground caverns. It has that strange kind of juxtaposition that the best areas of Elden Ring has. And while it didn't have the knock-the-wind-out-of-you effect that taking an elevator down, down, down into Nokron to see there was and is an entire civilization there complete with its own night sky had, it still impressive to see the scale of it and soak in the weird collision of themes.</p><p dir="ltr">The verticality was another reason that The Forsaken Hollows reminded me of Shadow of the Erdtree, which opted to swap some of the breadth of The Lands Between for the height of the Land of Shadow. While Ishizaki didn't attribute Shadow of the Erdtree as the inspiration for this verticality, the approach was intentional nevertheless.</p><p dir="ltr">"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right? We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4612756-elden1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612756" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4612756-elden1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612756"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4612756-elden1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Since I know there are some From Software fans who like to go into the games with only the basic information, I will warn that from this point I will be very briefly discussing some of the noteworthy enemies that we faced--or didn't in one case--so if you want to go in without knowing anything at all, be warned. For those that stick around, trust that I won't reveal too much so as to preserve the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The fact of the matter, honestly, is the new day three boss, which was the other big addition we got to check out, so thoroughly whooped us that it's hard to say much about them anyway. With that in mind, what I'll say is that the Nightlord we went up against was called Balancers and it pits Nightfarers up against multiple enemies, all of which are aggressive and demand a solid strategy built around movement that gives your comrades space but also communication that can enable you to shift priorities on a dime to help each other. Needless to say, our crew had a bit of a rough time beating the boss, even though we did make good progress towards it. Beyond that boss, there are a few other surprise appearances from the wider world of From Software games which I won't spoil. Of course, Artorias from Dark Souls has been showcased, but we weren't able to take him on, unfortunately.</p><p dir="ltr">Nightreign's upcoming DLC, like Nightreign itself, feels like From Software trying to do a lot with a little. By Ishizaki's own admission, The Forsaken Hollows was developed with stringent requirements, but that, he said, didn't dull the team's ambition.</p><p dir="ltr">"The schedule was always very tight and we had really limited resources, so it was always a battle of trying to do something that is doable within that limitation, but also doing it to the point where we feel like users are going to be satisfied. And I think all of the development staff, everyone really does want to make something that truly is special and that really does surprise users," Ishizaki explained.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even if we want to do something doable, it's like everyone wants to make something just a little bit better. So there's always this sort of push from everyone to just do a little bit more and that sort of snowballs generally. Honestly, I think it comes just from our staff and their love for the craft, for the players, and really wanting to try to make something the best it can be."</p><p dir="ltr">While Ishizaki is quick to bring in the Nightreign team and their contribution to the project, I wanted to take the opportunity to have him reflect on his experience as director. Although he has worked on multiple From Software titles, Nightreign was his first as director, making it a new experience for him. That alone would be daunting, but he also took on a project which, thanks to prior transparency, we know was developed under tricky conditions. As one of the key voices in From Software now and, given the success of Nightreign, someone who could likely become a bigger one in the future, I wanted to know if his experience as director is one he thinks of fondly and is keen to return to.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="231614531" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

way that we were able to do it; to use other assets and focus most of the budget on just really polishing it and making sure that the gameplay loop and experience is unique and fun.</p><p dir="ltr">"[In the future] it's definitely not something that we would, from the outset, be like, 'Okay, this is what we're going to do [it], this is how we're going to make [games].' I think it really just is if we have a really good idea, someone comes up with something great at just the right time, and it feels like that's the only way to do it, then it's worth considering. I definitely wouldn't put it in a sort of high-priority scenario for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it was a challenge for sure. Definitely the first time doing that; the first time being given that level of responsibility and definitely wanting the project to succeed. So I think given the result, it [has provided] a lot of confidence and reassured me as a creator that what I'm doing isn't necessarily wrong, and I can trust my instincts. Although there are definitely points of reflection as well and I don't really know what it's going to be like going forward, but given the opportunity, I would definitely like to take my learnings from [developing Nightreign] and feed them into something new and something that I can be proud of."</p><p dir="ltr">There's plenty of reason to be excited to see and experience the full breadth of what The Forsaken Hollows offers, especially since we only experienced a small slice of it. Where the game goes from there, or if it even has a future beyond the DLC, remains unclear, but given what it already is and the impact it had on Ishizaki, I expect this won't be the last time From Software leans into something unexpected and experimental.</p><p dir="ltr">And for those lore-obsessed fans that may be wondering: I didn't see any references to Londor. But maybe we'll find something when The Forsaken Hollows launches on December 4, 2025.</p>

It is an incredibly difficult thing to sell someone on a game in just one sentence. What are you meant to focus on, genre, specific mechanics, an interesting element of the story? There's not a right answer! I'm not going to figure out a recipe for success right here and now, but what I can do is at least show you a single sentence that sold me on a game called Burden Street Station quite quickly: "A surreal, narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game where you shapeshift during conversations to uncover how God went missing."
</p>
<p>
A stunner of a line! The concept of God going missing and the implication that it is your responsibility to figure it out says a tremendous amount in a few words. I know the genre, a narrative adventure game, and there is even a hint towards mechanics, the shapeshifting element. Personally, that's all I need to be convinced, but we'll dig deeper all the same.

A surreal game where you mostly help all sorts of freaks come to terms with the fact that god no longer exists.
and you'll get to know more about it it very, very soon.

DEMO COMING TO STEAM TOMORROW. WE WILL BE WAITING.

In the world of Burden Street Station, moments from the lives of mortals, be they good or bad, are taken and turned into sentient books, which in turn get sold to Gods for the same reason you and I read books, entertainment. Except in your particular world, the production of these books stops in its tracks, and its God vanishes. So you, alongside one of those sentient books, must talk to the people of this world to figure out what the hell went down.
</p><p>
There's an apparent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> influence here, and an overall '90s PC adventures game vibe, alongside more modern series like ENA. Mechanically, you can change different parts of your body throughout your conversations with mortals to produce different dialogue options, some of which look suitably irreverent and sarcastic, the epitome of '90s conversations.
</p>
<p>
Apparently a demo for it will be available tomorrow, December 2nd, so let's all agree to log on to Steam and give it a go, yeah? Or at least wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126340/Burden_Street_Station/">here</a> in the meantime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some good news for folks wanting an update on Sony’s previously announced <em>Helldivers</em> feature film. Justin Lin, best known for his work on the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">Fast &amp; Furious </a></em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">franchise</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-17-moments-that-defined-the-fast-and-the-furious-1794341835">,</a></em> is set to direct the cinematic adaptation of PlayStation and Arrowhead’s massively popular online co-op shooter.</p> <p>On December 1, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported that Justin Lin is going to both direct and produce</a> the <em>Helldivers</em> movie via his Perfect Storm Entertainment media company. He’ll be working alongside PlayStation Productions on the live-action adaptation, which was first announced in January 2025.&nbsp;The upcoming Helldivers movie has a script written by <em>Annabelle</em> and <em>It</em> writer Gary Dauberman.</p>

 <p>Justin Lin is a perfect choice for <em>Helldivers</em>. He has experience working on big-budget action movies, having directed <em>The Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast &amp; Furious 4, Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6,</em> and <em>F9: The Fast Saga.</em> He also directed <em>Star Trek: Beyond,</em> the third and presumably last film in the JJ Abrams-produced modern Star Trek reboot trilogy. While the Fast movies can be over-the-top nonsense, the action and visuals within the movies are top-notch notch and each one is fast-paced. This resume feels like the perfect fit for Helldivers, especially with a solid script that leans into the absurd space-facism of the series.</p>

 <p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> says that Lin isn’t a gamer, but used that fact to his advantage when pitching his take on <em>Helldivers</em> to Sony and PlayStation. He reportedly wants to focus on the humanity in the characters and feature a “timely” story as well as build up what could be a future franchise for the studio.</p> <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-ghost-tsushima-1851733809"> Sony has plenty of other PlayStation adaptations in the works</a>, including a <em>God of War</em> series, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> movie adaptations, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> anime spin-off. And let’s not forget the <em>Last of Us</em> series on HBO, which has proven to be a massive hit for all involved. Get ready, because this is just the start of Sony and other game studios digging into their vaults filled with old IP to find the next big blockbuster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers Film Adds Fast and Furious Director, It Writer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-film-director-fast-and-furious-it-writer/</link>
            <guid>1369876</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Justin Lin, the director of several Fast and Furious films, has been announced as the director of the live-action Helldivers film. In addition, the writer of several horror films, like Annabelle and I,t wrote the script for the video game adaptation. </p>



<p>As one of PlayStation’s newer series, Helldivers didn’t seem to hit its stride until 2024, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-brings-in-around-2-5-million-players-every-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it became a worldwide phenomenon</a>. The multiplayer sci-fi shooter was a viral sensation and still is in some ways. With constant updates and a recent port to Xbox, Arrowhead Studios’ hit felt primed for Hollywood. In January 2025, it was announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be brought to film</a> by Sony Pictures. Updates went silent for a bit until now, where it’s been revealed that a high-profile director and writer are attached.</p>







<h2 id="h-justin-lin-directing-helldivers-film-for-sony-pictures-written-by-gary-dauberman">Justin Lin Directing Helldivers Film for Sony Pictures, Written by Gary Dauberman</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the outlet revealed that <strong>Justin Lin has joined the Helldivers film as director</strong>. He will be adapting the project from a script <strong>written by Gary Dauberman</strong>. While additional crew and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting</a> have yet to be revealed, the report says that Lin <strong>plans to bring out the ‘humanity’ of the game</strong> with <strong>timely themes</strong> and <strong>a built-out world</strong>. It also seems like the story will <strong>revolve around a squad of elite Helldivers taking on various creatures and the Super Earth</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve watched any Fast and Furious movie from the 2010s, it’s likely been directed by Justin Lin. The filmmaker is a hit with action-film fans and a notable name in the genre. Currently, Lin is set to direct Keanu Reeves in BRZRKR and adapt One Punch Man into a film. For Gary Dauberman, the scribe has been behind some of horror’s recent hits like It (and its sequel, It Chapter Two), Annabelle, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>. All that said, it’ll be interesting to see how Helldivers shapes up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel.</p><p>Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-1236262719/"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>, scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it's not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ <a href="https://gameinformer.com/series-review/2024/04/22/knuckles-show-review-a-low-stakes-climb"><em>Knuckles</em></a> series?&nbsp; Let us know what you think in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/paramount-announces-a-new-sonic-universe-film-for-holiday-2028]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>Six years ago, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> was published by author Rachel Reid, the second novel in the popular hockey-rivals-turned-lovers series </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span>. Now, </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> is a Canadian TV series airing on HBO Max here in the US, and though it’s only been out for a few days, the internet is about to put itself in the penalty box with how openly horny viewers are getting about it.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, which stars Hudson Williams as Asian-Canadian hockey player Shane Hollander and Connor Storrie as his Russian-born rival, Ilya Rozanov, is what some may consider a yaoi series. The Japanese term is used for a hyperspecific media genre focused on male characters in sexual relationships, also known as Boy Love, and the series certainly seems to be leaning into that concept. There’s a lot of loaded looks, barely there caresses, heavy breathing, and, eventually, very hot sex.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span> premiered on November 28, and I have texted every single one of my friends about it over the course of the last few days (when describing the premise of “gay hockey men on rival teams” to my friend, she wrote back, “Did someone steal your diary?”). The show follows two players in the fictitious Major League Hockey league as they rise from ambitious rookies to superstars on the ice, all while navigating a searing hot attraction to each other. It’s currently sitting at an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it seems to be all anyone (read: women, gay men) can talk about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I will admit that I am a huge hockey fan, so my algorithm may be slightly skewed, but both my TikTok and Twitter For You pages have been filled with people reacting to </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>. Fans are posting their reactions to certain sexually explicit scenes (including one that takes place in the locker room) and others that are demure but filled with more tension than when two dudes have to sit in adjacent penalty boxes after beating the piss out of each other.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the only appropriate reaction to ilya in this moment <a href="https://t.co/EbH0UgQujx">pic.twitter.com/EbH0UgQujx</a></p> <p>— Rosie 💖 (@fangirl000777) <a href="https://twitter.com/fangirl000777/status/1995341190238249354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All you horny bitches keep tweeting about is Heated Rivalry or is my algorithm just very homosexual… the thirst is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before dear lord</p> <p>— Lushious Massacr (@LushiousMassacr) <a href="https://twitter.com/LushiousMassacr/status/1994989655993766396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there’s gonna be a lot of “no mom, I just love hockey” happening across the US family HBO Max plans</p> <p>— spencer (top 0.1% of spencers) (@hoddsuspenders) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoddsuspenders/status/1995251268059865542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">you’d have to put me in an involuntary psychiatric hold if i was hollander <a href="https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA">https://t.co/a3xrMvcodA</a></p> <p>— cooper (@marnieapologist) <a href="https://twitter.com/marnieapologist/status/1994806070544666766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/qhLPJBRjHL">pic.twitter.com/qhLPJBRjHL</a></p> <p>— CINEMA 505 (@CINEMA505) <a href="https://twitter.com/CINEMA505/status/1994491724761370840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That the lead actors are leaning into the show’s horniess is helping to increase the </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>hype.

		<p>Amazon’s TV adaption of Sony’s God of War games has landed an Emmy award-winning director for the first two episodes. Frederick E.O. Toye has signed up and should be familiar with historical violence having directed Shogun for Disney, and also The Boys for Amazon.</p>
<p>He joins Ronald D. Moore, creator of the highly acclaimed Battlestar Galactica remake, who will be the showrunner for the two seasons that have been ordered. The series was announced in 2022 with Rafe Judkins as the showrunner, but he left the project in 2024 due to creative differences.</p>


<p><em>“’God of War’&nbsp;is a compelling, character-driven franchise that we believe will captivate our global customers as much with its expansive and immersive worlds as its rich storytelling,”</em> Vernon Sanders, head of global television at Amazon Studios, said. <em>“We are honored to share in the adventure of exploring the&nbsp;God of War&nbsp;mythology in such a momentous way with Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, and Santa Monica Studio.”</em></p>
<p>Sony has a Horizon Zero Dawn movie in the works and a sequel to the Uncharted movie was announced years ago, but that seems to be dead in the water, perhaps due to Tom Holland’s busy schedule.&nbsp; Sony Pictures are also producing the Metal Gear Solid movie.</p>

            <p>
Around May last year, the one and only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/ron-gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island">Monkey Island</a> fame announced an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that was meant to be some kind of mix between classic Zelda, and Diablo, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, that last one being another of the game designer's notable works. It never got a full reveal, or even a name, and unfortunately it seems it never will, as it's essentially been canned.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert recently spoke with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">Ars Technica</a> about his career, including his most recently released game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ron-gilberts-new-death-by-scrolling-rpg-about-never-ending-grind-and-the-absurdity-of-social-media-is-out-now">Death by Scrolling</a>, which just launched this October, but the interview kicks off by discussing his unnamed RPG. The designer explained that after working on adventure games like Thimbleweed Park and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-to-monkey-island">Return to Monkey Island</a> for a good many years, he was "thinking about something new."
</p>
<p>
That something new resulted in Gilbert hiring an artist and another designer, putting a year's worth of time into the aforementioned RPG. The problem? Not enough people, and as is the case with most of life, not enough money. "I just [didn’t] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained. "You know, it’s either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."
</p>
<p>
For Gilbert, bringing in funds was tougher than he thought it would be. He tried pitching the game to various places, but "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible." He continued, "Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn’t the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn’t look at it as ‘we’re gonna make $100 million and it’s worth investing in.' The amount of money they’re willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."
</p><p>
Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter don't work so well these days either, as Gilbert's Thimbleweed Park also went that route, and while it wracked up more than $600,000, the game dev noted that it still had private investors providing half of the game's final budget.
</p>
<p>
This is mostly just another reminder that making games isn't just hard because they're technically complex, but they have material necessities that can't always be met due to external forces. Would be nice if someone did something about that. Revolution anyone?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>

This first-person shooter takes place in a universe where aliens came to Earth to use humanity as ingredients for intergalactic pharmaceutical drugs. Now, a new trailer for the game facetiously markets itself to alien consumers as it encourages them to use Humanzapro, a new wonder drug made from humans.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTG28-CZbI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkTG28-CZbI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer is done in the style of pharmaceutical ads that typically run on American TV. All of the tropes of those ads are present, including the footage of happy aliens after they've taken the drug. Intriguingly, the ad warns humans that they shouldn't be taking Humanzapro because of side effects. That makes us wonder if this particular drug will be a power-up during the game.</p><p>High on Life introduced players to the Rick and Morty-esque talkative sci-fi weapons, which was fitting since the first game was produced by Rick and Morty co-creator--and Squanch Games co-founder--Justin Roiland, who also voiced a sentient alien weapon. Roiland was forced out of Squanch Games and Rick and Morty following <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/justin-roiland-abuse-allegations-what-we-know-1826967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a series of allegations</a>.</p><p>The sequel is introducing a new feature that will let players skateboard into battle and incorporate it into their offensive moves. Alternatively, players can use the boards to perform tricks.</p><p>High on Life 2 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 13, 2026. It's also slated to be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release for PC and Xbox Series X|S. Outside of the game, it was reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-success-story-high-on-life-getting-a-tv-show-with-one-of-its-hilarious-voice-actors/1100-6525587/">High on Life animated series</a> is in development.</p>

<p>Note that this <em>isn't</em> the planned Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, which is coming out in <strong>March 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>We have no other details right now, but there are a lot of opportunities to branch out in the Sonic universe, with tons of untapped characters and other video games the movies can draw from.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like a no-brainer to expand the Sonic movie universe — the first three films have all received warm critical reception, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie">particularly Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, and fans seem to absolutely love them.</p>
<p>Collectively, the franchise has made over $1 billion at the box office and spawned a TV show focusing on Knuckles the Echidna, so more movies surely means more money.</p>
<p>We at least have some idea of who will feature in the Sonic 4 movie, so we'll have to excitedly wait and see on what the Sonic Universe movie will bring.</p>
