<p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">announced</a> they have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair, the makers of the heavily Pokémon-inspired <em>Palworld</em>. The Tokyo District Court lawsuit seeks an injunction and damages "on the grounds that <em>Palworld</em> infringes multiple patent rights" according to the announcement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years," the company writes.</p>
<p>The many surface similarities between <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Palworld</em> are readily apparent, even though Pocketpair's game adds many new features over Nintendo's (such as, uh, guns). But making legal hay over even heavy common ground between games <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/game-makers-face-uphill-battle-proving-copyright-infringement-in-court/">can be an uphill battle</a>. That's because copyright law (at least in the US) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones">generally doesn't apply to a game's mere design elements</a>, and only extends to "expressive elements" such as art, character design, and music.
</p><p>Generally, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/attacking-the-clones-indie-game-devs-fight-blatant-rip-offs/">blatant rip-offs of successful games</a> are able to make just enough changes to those "expressive" portions to avoid any legal trouble. But <em>Palworld</em> might clear the high legal bar for infringement if the game's 3D character models were indeed lifted almost wholesale from actual Pokémon game files, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-pokemon-plagiarism-accusations-pile-up-as-ceo-responds/">some observers</a> have been alleging since January.
</p><h2>What patent are we talking about?</h2>
<p>Beyond mere copyright concerns, though, Nintendo's lawsuit announcement specifically alleges <em>patent</em> infringement on the part of <em>Palworld</em> (though this difference could come down to vagaries of translation from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2024/240919.html">the original Japanese</a>). A lawsuit over patents would seemingly require <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/patents-on-video-game-mechanics-may-strangle-innovation/">some unique game mechanic</a> or feature that has been specifically granted stronger protections by the patent office. While the Pokémon Company <a href="https://patents.justia.com/assignee/the-pokemon-company">does hold a number of (US) patents</a>, most of them seem to deal with various server communications methods or the sleep monitoring capabilities of <a href="https://www.pokemonsleep.net/en/">Pokémon Sleep</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"<em>Palworld</em> is such a different type of game from <em>Pokémon</em>, it’s hard to imagine what patents (*not* copyrights) might have been even plausibly infringed," game industry attorney Richard Hoeg <a href="https://x.com/HoegLaw/status/1836553535028367627">posted on social media</a> Wednesday night. "Initial gut reaction is Nintendo may be reaching."</p>
<p>PocketPair CEO Takuro Mizobe <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240122-25873/">told Automaton Media</a> in January that the game had "cleared legal reviews" and that "we have absolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies."</p>
<p>Shortly after <em>Palworld </em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/the-janky-palworlds-success-points-to-hunger-for-an-actual-grown-up-pokemon-game/">became a viral mega-hit on Steam</a> in January, Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/pokemon-company-will-investigate-palworld-in-light-of-plagiarism-accusations/">said</a> that it would "investigate and take appropriate measures" against "another [then-unnamed] company's game released in January 2024." Those measures are now moving forward even as <em>Palworld</em>'s initial burst of popularity <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/is-palworld-a-dead-game-who-cares-says-the-games-developer/">has given way to more modest player numbers</a> in recent months.

<p>As you explore Willamette Mall, you’ll stumble upon various skill books in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. When you pick the booklet up, there’s very little information on how they function besides a +1 to a specific skill or feature in the game. Well, here’s a bit more information on the mechanic for you!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-books-in-dead-rising-work">How Books in Dead Rising Work</h2>



<p>When you find a book in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, it’s wise to consider your options carefully. A book will take up an inventory slot; it doesn’t automatically disappear into an invisible inventory in your jacket, so be wary of how much you’re carrying and what. If you can do without a weapon or food item, then go ahead and take the book.</p>



<p>Books only provide their buff when in your inventory. Just because you found the book does not mean you’ll receive its buff throughout the game. You must carry it with you for it to take effect.</p>



<p>Again, this means sacrificing a single space in your extremely limited inventory wheel.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-get-skill-books-in-dead-rising">Where to Get Skill Books in Dead Rising</h2>



<p>You’ll find several books lying around in random shops, seemingly dropped by survivors during the early hours of the zombie apocalypse. But for the most part, they’re typically found nearby or within specific shops, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Everyone Luvs Books</strong> (Entrance Plaza)</li>



<li><strong>Contemporary Reading</strong> (Paradise Plaza)</li>



<li><strong>Sir Book-a-Lot </strong>(Wonderland Plaza)</li>



<li><strong>The Sinister Read</strong> (Entrance Plaza)</li>



<li><strong>Bachman’s Bookporium</strong> (Paradise Plaza)</li>
</ul>



<p>You will occasionally receive skill books for completing scoops (side quests) in the game, too. While you likely want to see the entire story of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, it’s essential not to forego too many of the game’s side quests, as they do provide excellent rewards that can see you through the end of the game. But you can always find more during the game’s endless mode!</p>



<hr>



<p>Once you start collecting books, use the skill buffs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-rescue-survivors-in-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help you save survivors</a> on your way back to the Security Room! In the meantime, visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums</a> to discuss Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and other games you’re excited to play this year!</p>

<p>The Willamette Mall is home to numerous shops that, oddly enough, sell full-blown battle weapons designed for open warfare in the medieval ages. Of course, they’re antiques, and you’re repurposing them for zombie slaying, but hey, semantics, right? Here is where to get the Battle Axe early in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-battle-axe-early-in-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">How to Get a Battle Axe Early in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s only one place to find the battle axe in Willamette Mall, and that’s at Ned’s Knicknackery in the Entrance Plaza. It’s on the second floor, right-hand side, when looking at the main entrance to the mall where the game truly begins. Once inside the small antique store, head to the back-right of the shop, where you’ll find a wall of various antique weapons primarily for show. </p>



<p>Once you break the glass, you can pick up the Battle Axe. Despite numerous weapons, shields, and helmets being displayed in the case, you can only get the Battle Axe. But that’s okay, it’s all you need. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-battle-axe-effectively">How to Use the Battle Axe Effectively</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While every weapon in the game serves some purpose, the Battle Axe is a group-slaying monstrosity capable of cutting down multiple zombies with a single swing. Frank swings the axe in a large swathe ahead of him, taking out two, sometimes three, zombies without issue. </p>



<p>Like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-katana-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katana</a>, the Battle Axe breaks after middling usage. It lasts for 25 hits, and then it’s done. That said, you can enhance the Battle Axe by tracking down the Criminal Biography book, found in Sir Books-A-Lot (Wonderland Plaza), which increases the durability of all edged weapons in the game by 3x. It’s indispensable for the whole game!</p>

<p>Surprisingly, what is easily one of the best melee weapons in the game is available to you relatively early on in your playthrough. The Katana in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a lightning-quick melee weapon capable of slicing and dicing zombies and cultists alike, and here’s how to get one early!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-katana-in-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">How to Get a Katana in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</h2>



<p>There are various locations throughout the Willamette Mall where a Katana will spawn, but the most likely spot to find one is Ned’s Knicknackery in the Entrance Plaza. It’s a small shop, barely noticeable, on the second floor on the right-hand side when facing the entrance to the mall. The shop is a little antique store with a wooden facade and a green and gold sign over the door, and inside, you’ll find several priceless vases, collectibles, and, on the way back, a selection of antique weapons.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alternatively, you can find one at Ripper’s Blades in the North Plaza, and one spawns on top of the ledge underneath Colombian Roastmasters in the Food Court. You’ll have to jump down from the Orange Juice stall nearby to reach the ledge, but it’s worth a little awkward parkour to nab!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-katana-effectively">How to Use the Katana Effectively</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it’s easily one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-weapons-in-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">better melee weapons</a> in the game, the Katana will break after 20 hits. It does not last long, and you’ll find that, while you can clear a good chunk of an entire plaza, it’s not enough. You want more. Thankfully, items tend to respawn in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, so you can return to Ned’s Nicknackery for another one in the future.</p>



<p>For now, I recommend saving the Katana for when you genuinely need a card up your sleeve. It’s an excellent choice to beat the convicts in Leisure Park and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-deal-with-cultists-in-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make quick work of the cultists</a> throughout the mall. But for the average zombie? I’d say use a baseball bat or hunting knife to avoid breaking your precious sword too quickly!</p>



<hr>



<p>Various skill books throughout Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster pair well with the Katana, and we have a guide on how those books work in the game!

            <p>
Nintendo is suing Pocketpair, developer of hit Pokémon-style game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>, over the alleged infringement of "multiple patent rights". 
</p>
<p>
In a brief public <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html">statement</a> posted to Nintendo's website in the early hours of this morning, the company confirmed it had filed a patent infringement lawsuit in a Tokyo court yesterday, 18th September. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is now seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights".
</p>
<p>
Palworld has constantly been compared to Pokémon since it was first announced, and has often been referred to as "Pokémon with guns". The monster collecting and battling game has even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">come under fire from Pokémon's own fans</a>, who have said that many of Palworld's creature designs are similar.
</p>
<p>
Originally released in January this year for PC and Xbox, including on Xbox Game Pass, Palworld proved to be a hit. In its first month of release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-propels-xbox-to-best-ever-month-of-console-playtime">Palworld drove Xbox's "biggest month ever on console" in terms of play time</a>, with 10 million players giving Palworld a go across Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">further 15 million people joining in via Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Palworld's success did not go unnoticed at the time by The Pokémon Company, of which Nintendo is a key stakeholder. In late January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">The Pokémon Company released a rare statement addressing Palworld's existence</a>, and said it intended to "investigate" for any content it believed may "infringe on intellectual property rights". Six months later, however, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">confirmed that threat had not been followed up behind the scenes</a>.</p>
<p>So why now? Much of the hubbub from Palworld's original launch has died down, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">Pocketpair has more recently teased a version of Palworld for PlayStation 5</a>. It seems possible Nintendo is acting now, before any official announcement of the game's PS5 version materialises.</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself," the company's statement today concludes, "to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Pocketpair for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld, alleging infringement of patent rights.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company filed the lawsuit today, September 18 in the Tokyo District Court. "This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights," the press release said.</p><p>"Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years."</p><p>Back in January, Nintendo said that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">intended to investigate Palworld</a>, saying that it would take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on IP rights related to Pokemon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially announced</a> that it is suing PocketPair, the creators of Palworld, in collaboration with The Pokemon Company. In a statement on NintendoCoLtd on X, Nintendo filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court on September 18, 2024. This lawsuit aims to seek an injunction against infringement and damages after PocketPair allegedly infringed multiple patents in Palworld.</p>
<p>This news isn't surprising, except that it didn't come sooner. Palworld was first released in January 2024. In the game, there are plenty of "Pals" that look incredibly similar to the creatures in Pokemon, to the point that it's bordering on stealing. While it did do relatively well when the game came out, there was still a lot of controversy about the aesthetic of the Pals and the cheap feel of the game. Despite this, Palworld has over 274,000 reviews on Steam, and sits at a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>Nintendo has dealt with PocketPair before<span>. People were&nbsp;modding the game to add </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-pokemon-mod-taken-out-nintendo-base-game-copying/">Pokemon</a> and other details from the Nintendo franchise. As a result, Nintendo managed to get the mods taken down.</p>
<p>What this means in the future for the game is uncertain, and it's possible that people will see Palworld be delisted or completely unavailable to play, depending on how Nintendo chooses to proceed with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The letter released by Nintendo was incredibly short but finishes by saying, "Nintendo will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights, including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years."</p>
<p>Considering how aggressive Nintendo is when anything looks remotely similar to a product of theirs, or even Pokemon fan games or emulations, it's no surprise that they are going ahead with a lawsuit against PocketPair. It's likely that they will be quite aggressive in their lawsuits, as they have sent plenty of cease and desist in the past to many different creators regarding their Nintendo-inspired creations.</p>
<p>What comes as a shock to most people is how long it's taken Nintendo to do this, as most people expected that the day would never come when Nintendo would sue PocketPair, despite some of their designs being blatantly obvious. For example, there are Pals that look incredibly similar to Electabuzz, Wooloo, Yamper, and Eevee, to name a few. Barely any of the creature designs in the game are original and can be equated to some form of Pokemon across all of the generations or even a mash-up of two different Pokemon to create a Pal.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This controversy has been discussed on social media repeatedly over the months, but it seems that their day in court has now arrived.</p>

Midway through the game’s trailer, the tone shifts from “catch these cute monsters that will help you build your home” to “shoot these cute monsters and use them as slave labor.” One of the most memorable moments from that first trailer was the image of a bunch of pals (the monsters are called pals) that look startlingly like Sprigatito, mournfully manufacturing assault rifles on an assembly line.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-a47276b4-ec5c-45f9-8834-fe9809c196d9"><div><p>Over five million copies of Palworld have been sold since Friday.</p><p>Lots of people have been <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1749360035938070627?s=20">catching Pals</a> and hatching eggs, according to the game’s developer, Pocketpair. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/"><em>Palworld</em></a><em> </em>is also currently the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most-played game</a> on Steam, hitting a peak of roughly 1.5 million players. </p><p>The game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-with-guns-palworld-scam-real-steam-release-xbox-1851173423">described</a> by <em>Kotaku</em> as “if someone tossed <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, Pokémon, and some AR-15s into a giant blender,” is a breakout hit despite seemingly coming out of nowhere.</p><br></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Tiny Glade Review]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiny-glade-review.985044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-glade-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A wonderfully relaxing building sim with slim content.</h2></div><div><section><p>Playing Tiny Glade –  the latest cozy game to offer us all an escape from the dumpster fire purgatory that is modern life – for the first time is like sitting down with some building blocks and falling into a hypnotic trance. One minute you’re just adding a tower and some windows to an old house, and suddenly you look up and you’ve spent two hours building a sprawling village with ponds and crooked paths, your screenshots folder is bursting with images of your little masterpiece at dusk and dawn, and your back hurts because you never did get a proper chair for your home office. Its biggest flaw is that, as the name implies, there just isn't enough of it. </p><p>To say I was “playing Tiny Glade” arguably isn’t even accurate. It’s more like I was playing <em>with</em> it. You could call it a building sim, but it’s more like a set of enchanted Lego bricks, or a much prettier Minecraft creative mode. You get a blank canvas of terrain and a small set of tools to build some houses, place water and plants, take photos, and… well, that’s it. So if building freely and setting your own goals are not enough to keep your attention, know that Tiny Glade is not going to throw any armies of orcs at your scenic battlements, and no one actually lives here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tiny Glade Review</h3></div></output><p>It’s also a shallow pond rather than a deep ocean of content, but it does make the most of what it has. As someone who has built a million dysfunctional settlements for games, at first I cocked an eyebrow at the limited customization options on offer. Towers and buildings, plants, ponds, and paths didn't seem like enough to keep me busy, but as I experimented the limitations let my brain forget about building something specific because the tools take care of details thoughtfully and delightfully. Dragging a path right up to a building meant a door popped up on the front; Placing windows next to each other changed them from a simple pane to a wide bay window. Ducks arrived at the pond I had made and sheep wandered through the open areas and then, at night, the little lamps I had placed gave off a soft glow. It's almost meditative, seeing tiny changes in the environment affect your creation, safe in the knowledge there's no better or “best” way to do it, or anything you can put in place can't be taken away again with a quick click of the mouse. Doctors could probably prescribe it as part of anger management treatments - who can be mad when they're busy placing happy little trees? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That's the sweet spot for Tiny Glade: a small slice of flow state to pamper your brain and make the real world seem very far away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>Unfortunately, after a few building sessions, it felt like Tiny Glade had run out of surprises. The delightful procedurally generated details that were added as I built were feeling repetitive, and making a house blue or green or tall or small or built entirely over water – imagine the black mold – lost its charm. The same restrictions that allow everything to fit together so smoothly also mean that more creative types who want to experiment are going to have a very limited set of parameters to do that in. Building in different seasons, moving the clock forward to watch the lights come on in the windows, all of those tweaks can only maintain the thrill for so long. Covering a house all in lamps? Who cares, when you and your Steam screenshot folder are the only ones who will ever even notice, aside from the aforementioned sheep.</p><p>There is at least a theme of the day that offers the gentlest of suggestions, setting a vibe and starting you off with a small hamlet for you to adapt. However, you're not getting graded on your work, so after a while the novelty of direction erodes like bad masonry. That said, after a few days’ break I was back again, using it as the equivalent of a cerebral fidget toy in between cutting Tyranids in half. That's the sweet spot for Tiny Glade: a small slice of flow state to pamper your brain and make the real world seem very far away.  </p><p>Of course, on the internet the rule for anything is “pics or it didn't happen,” and Tiny Glade has met that challenge with a peachy-keen screenshot mode. It even has a first-person mode so you can explore your creation on foot, and see just how wrong you got the angles on that particular bit of garden wall from the perspective of a flying ghostly architect. I can absolutely see a world where hardcore fans trade screenshots, gently compete to out-cute each other, but I'll be keeping my adorable creations to myself, thank you very much. Still, having a way to preserve and play in the little sets I created is a nice touch, and I hope other games steal the screenshot toolset immediately for its clever mix of control and simplicity. </p><p>Everything that's in Tiny Glade is a little spoonful of joy, from sheep to walled-in gardens to creating tall towers with a Rapunzel vibe, but it's a gaming snack. Go in expecting dozens of hours of gameplay and you'll burn through it after a few hours and call it a day. See it as an art package that you'll bring up when a creative mood strikes and you'll find a magical little toolset to get lost in. It may be small in stature, but Tiny Glade will live forever in my Steam library, ready to use its coziness to quell the darkness that lurks within my very soul. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Good things come in small packages, and Tiny Glade is no exception. The gameplay might be limited – or even nonexistent, depending on your definition – but treat it as a toy set and the time you lose to creating villages full of duck ponds and flower gardens won't be. It could certainly use more content and flexibility to dive deeper into, but the way you can quickly and easily create a natural-looking structure using its satisfying procedural building tools got more out of what it has than I expected. Learn to live with the lack of actual objectives, enemies, or natural disasters, and you'll be rewarded with a flow state that borders on a trance and a set of screenshots that will make you huge on #cottagecore TikTok. </p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Tiny Glade Review</h3><div><p>good</p><p>Tiny Glade is a building game so cozy it may as well be serving you buttered crumpets alongside its delightful dioramas.

                <p>Bravomonster's line of premium RC cars are currently on sale at a pretty nice discount, including the <a href="https://go.linkby.com/OSJMBMWD/daa7aa89-e41c-4a23-ace8-c9cbfe010643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speedster Rechargeable Sports Car</a>, which won the Red Dot Design award for craftsmanship in 2019. Typically <strong>sold for $130</strong>, you can add the high-end RC car to your collection for <strong>just $97.49</strong>.</p><p>This Bravomonster vehicle isn’t your typical RC car. It’s designed with a 5-line intelligent digital servo, a suspension system, RWD for enhanced performance, and a controller featuring Hall sensor sticks for precise control. In other words, you’ll get a car that’s smooth, responsive, and easy to maneuver. It also looks remarkably sleek, with aggressive curves throughout the entire design.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4368659-mixcollage-17-sep-2024-11-49-am-7904.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368659" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4368659-mixcollage-17-sep-2024-11-49-am-7904.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368659"></a><figcaption>The Bravomonster Speedster and Muscle Mayhem RC Cars</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4368659-mixcollage-17-sep-2024-11-49-am-7904.jpg"></figure><p>Bravomonster ensured the vehicle wasn't just pretty, but also durable, constructing it with scratch-resistant paint to help it withstand the rigors of daily use. One of the coolest features of the RC car is <strong>racing mode</strong>, which cranks up the power output so you can perform drifts or send the car flying off ramps. Bravomonster says the car is “suitable for professional RC car enthusiasts and casual hobbyists,” so if you’re seeking an RC car that can do it all, this one is hard to beat.</p><p>You’ll get 30 minutes of juice in racing mode and 50 minutes in normal mode. Once the battery is drained, the built-in USB-C port makes it easy to get back on the racetrack.</p><p>If you’re looking for something with a more rugged style, the <a href="https://go.linkby.com/OSJMBMWD/daa7aa89-e41c-4a23-ace8-c9cbfe010643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Muscle Mayhem RC Car</a> is also discounted to <strong>$97.49 (was $130)</strong>. It gets you the same features as the above RC car, but its design was largely inspired by classic muscle cars. Specs include a remote control with Hall effect sticks, RWD differential, and a USB-C charging port.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=RC+bravomonster&amp;crid=N4GUSREBL56H&amp;sprefix=rc+bravomonster%2Caps%2C87&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> also has discounts on even more Bravomonster RC cars.</p><p>Though it’s not made by Bravomonster--and it’s not nearly as fancy--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Nintendo-Mario-Anti-Gravity-Racer/dp/B01CEY489S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Kart Anti-Gravity Mini RC Racer</a> is also discounted right now. You’ll find it for $26 (was $40) at Amazon. It’s not a professional-grade RC car, but if you’re seeking a fun toy, it’s a much more frugal option. Best of all, it’s designed to perform 360-degree spins and wheelies, which is pretty cool functionality for a car under $30.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-ambition-journey-to-the-west<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> does not, ultimately, care what I think about it. To the degree that criticism matters (reporting being a different beast), mine has never mattered less. There is something liberating and refreshing about that. The <em>Journey To The West </em>themed game is a breakout hit, selling <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=markets&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">18 million copies</a> in 2 weeks, primarily in China but not insignificantly internationally. It is a very good game – bold, ambitious, and constantly innovative. It is also a little lopsided at times, charming in some ways and less so in others, both of which speak to the relative newness of developer Game Science in producing this kind of game. It is a game that matters quite a bit to the future of games; its ambition should not be ignored.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>This game has the highest density of Buddhas in any game, possibly surpassing the champion: Asura's Wrath. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>You can learn a lot about a country by looking at what movies gross the highest there. Many times you will find several American movies on the list due to our outsized cultural presence, but in the case of China it will be movies like <em>Wolf Warrior 2</em>, <em>Detective Chinatown 3</em>,<em> The Battle at Lake Changjin </em>– a mix of comedies and military flicks that you don’t usually watch in the States. Have you ever heard of the movie <em>YOLO</em>? It grossed $479.5 million dollars and came out this year. Though there have been attempts at breakout crossover hits from China (Zhang Yimou succeeded brilliantly with <em>Hero</em>, only to direct the laughable <em>The Great Wall </em>later) most are made for domestic audiences. Though <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is almost jarringly in this vein, it differs a little in part because of the nature of gaming and the specific quirks of digital distribution.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Many Chinese blockbusters make obscene money domestically but never cross over. <em>Yolo</em>, a remake of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Yen_Love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 Yen Love</a>, </em>came out this year and made $479.5 million dollars. Credit: Deng Feng International Media, Wanda Pictures</figcaption></figure><p>Though <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody needs to know how many people are playing a single player game</a>, it is impossible to miss a gargantuan $70 million blockbuster single player game just sitting fully wrapped on Steam beating <em>Counter-Strike</em> in concurrents. Through sheer gravity in a digitally distributed marketplace, it attracts attention in a way that movies often struggle to do unless they arrive on a streaming platform. What’s more, there’s a degree to which gamers can just kind of roll with something if the game plays well and the spectacle is grand enough, and largely that is true here.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Baby Buddha. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s popularity in the West, to the degree that it can be quantified, reminds me quite a bit of the popularity of Telugu hit <em>RRR </em>in more ways than one. As pure spectacle, the appeal of that film is universal – you do not need to know history and geopolitics to understand why picking up a motorcycle and hitting a guy with it is pretty sick. But <em>RRR</em> is suffused with cultural, nationalistic and religious symbolism that goes beyond the basic literacy of many Western audiences.&nbsp; Most gamers who are not Buddhist probably do not know who Maitreya is and why they are in a video game, in much the same way that most Westerners who watched <em>RRR </em>on Netflix didn’t know who Komaram Bheem is, why there’s an extended sequence about the god Rama near the end, and the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-man-behind-indias-controversial-global-blockbuster-rrr-s-s-rajamouli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">religious and political implications</a> of such a scene.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's Zhu Bajie, but he's tiny! Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>That <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>does not stop to explain itself adds to the confidence of its execution. Of course you know who Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie are! Everyone knows that. The game presumes you know Erlang Shen, Princess Iron Fan (Rakshasi), The <a href="http://bull_demon_king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bull Demon King</a>, and the demonic child Red Boy. Allusions are made to the shapeshifting bone demoness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigujing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baigujing</a>. In the abstract you could argue that <em>God of War</em> does a similar trick, but the prior knowledge of the plot of <em>Journey to the West</em> is far more load bearing here. <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> also does something similar, but it is nowhere near to this level of scale, polish, or success, and it is helped in the West by <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>being a long-running franchise. Compounding this is the fact <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is not an adaptation but a sequel to <em>Journey to the West</em>. Save for the very beginning, you do not directly play as Sun Wukong but the “Destined One,” an entirely different monkey attempting to take up his mantle. That the Destined One is a taciturn, silent protagonist is a bit disappointing to me given that Sun Wukong’s whole deal is that he’s one of the biggest loudmouthed pricks in fiction, but this is ultimately a game that is attempting to comment on the story instead of telling it directly, which is the correct approach when limited to 6 chapters and 35-50 in-game hours. Many of the most successful movies about <em>Journey to the West </em>take the tack of either limiting the scope out of necessity or being loose with the source material (Stephen Chow has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chinese_Odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starred in</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West:_Conquering_the_Demons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directed</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West:_The_Demons_Strike_Back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written </a>many of these), because you just don’t have the time to do it in a non-serialized format.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The game has an incredible density of freaky little dudes. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>I would be remiss to talk about this game without touching on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting about sexism surrounding developer Game Science</a>, as well as the<a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> very strangely worded list of do’s and don’ts</a> sent to streamers by Game Science collaborator Hero Games. I’m not the best person to analyze the potential misogyny of the Chinese gaming scene or game development culture, but trying to draft this game into a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Western culture war</a> has always struck me as funny given how tame the actual plot is. Though it does not necessarily reflect on the development of the game, women are well-represented in the story, although much of that happens much later in chapters 3-5. None of the political issues present in the influencer guide are commented upon in the game itself. For all the controversy surrounding the game’s development and release, the actual <em>text </em>of the game is anodyne in the way that most blockbusters have to be, and which is unsurprising given its source material.</p><figure><figcaption>The art direction in this game is so striking.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a work of gargantuan ambition and enthusiasm tempered by growing pains. Part of this has to do with general pacing and level layout. As some of the largely positive reviews have pointed out, the basic layout of the levels are confusingly similar at times, compounded by arbitrary invisible boundaries, and are easy to get turned around in, particularly since the game doesn’t have a map. This improves a bit as you move away from the first chapter and see other zones that are not just a forest, but levels remain labyrinthine. Sometimes this adds to the general mood of the game. The lack of a map makes the secrets you find feel particularly special. As the game progresses, the settings become increasingly imaginative and robust. You begin to anticipate the ways that the stages wind and twist. In a spider cave later on in the game (note: if you are afraid of bugs, this game is not for you), this is combined with a lot of verticality.</p><figure><figcaption>The game picks up steam at the second half of chapter 2 and then proceeds to add new quirks as the game goes on. Credit: Game Science.</figcaption></figure><p>The game does not start on its best foot after its bombastic opening. The combat can feel uneven and sluggish until you hit the second chapter to third and everything finally clicks. Much of this has to do with the general rate at which the game drip feeds you your full moveset, and the pace of combat only makes sense if your full suite of abilities can be cycled and cooled down. Both <em>God of War </em>and <em>Lies of P </em>have similar issues with tech tree windup<em>. </em>In fact, I found many comparisons between <em>Wukong </em>and <em>Lies of P</em>, which seem to find their footing and confidence as they progress. When everything does finally snap into place, the game’s combat becomes as tight as a drum.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Combat in this game goes from being simple and very easy to punishingly hard near the later chapters. The game improves as your kit opens up. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>Both <em>Lies of P</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>are innovative and unabashedly “soulslike,” although the latter is only punishingly brutal in parts and does not contain the signature roguelike elements of a Souls<em> </em>game. FromSoft’s influence is unambiguously present, not just in terms of storytelling, combat and tone, but also in terms of general visual language of the monsters and world. “Between <em>Sekrio </em>and <em>God of War</em>” is how I have been pitching what <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> does. Both <em>Wukong </em>and<em> P</em> are also shockingly good first attempts at action adventure games, from companies that had little to no experience in it, in ways that add to and at times outdo the games they are influenced by.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - PC Tech Review - The High-End Graphics Experience" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OItx2QHZt68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I'm not gonna lie, this game is gorgeous but was rough going when I played it.</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is a shocking degree of creativity on display in how Game Science has decided to render the universe of <em>Black Myth: Wukong, </em>from towering, trans-dimensional pagodas in snowy climates to dense spider caves. It looks gorgeous, many of Unreal Engine 5’s bells and whistles like Nanite have been turned on, and the game makes extensive use of particle effects in several fights, from billowing smoke to snow and sand or leaves. One fight makes aggressive use of floating pages of Buddhist scripture. <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is also a poorly optimized game at times, although definitely not the worst I have seen, with framerates often plummeting suddenly in certain areas. But what strikes me is the sheer confidence, the boldness of every choice in the game.There are no half-measures in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>; it is clearly the work of a company that has yet to hit its stride, but which is trying to make a scene with its arrival.</p><figure><figcaption>Wukong's animated segments are some of the best I have seen in any game, and feature anime segments from anime veterans. It's like they threw <em>The Animatrix</em> in there as an extra. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>What really elevates the <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is the sheer density of it. Much of the production (although not polish) is on par with some of Sony’s best first party titles, but no part of it feels extraneous or watered down. You fight more than 100 bosses in the game, and a shocking percentage of them are not repeated. The ones that are repeated are done with good reason. Creatures and characters from the original novel are not only rendered and interpreted faithfully down to minute details, but every one of them has a dense, <em>Final Fantasy XII </em>style bestiary illustration and lore entry complete with poetry.&nbsp; Elaborate in-game animation and motion capture, fantastic voice acting, and wildly creative choices are around every corner. The headless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sanxian</a> player, played by Xiong Zhuying, is one of my favorite cameo characters in a long time. The <a href="https://x.com/AniNewsAndFacts/status/1828444919502893113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elaborate anime segments</a> between chapters, done by accomplished animators like <a href="https://x.com/cekibeing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chengxi Huang</a> and <a href="https://x.com/hiromatsu1988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiromatsu Shuu</a>, are <a href="https://x.com/Hiromatsu1988/status/1836045802701295836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jaw-dropping</a> not only in their complexity, but in the way that they add to the backstory in a way that is parallel to the plot. Each one is unique, often animated in entirely different styles and mediums, with each feeling incredibly distinct. It’s like if you put an <em>Animatrix-</em>tier animation anthology in the middle of a <em>Final Fantasy </em>game. Even the way the game’s combat fuses existing gameplay conventions with new behaviors plucked right from Sun Wukong’s story is shockingly innovative.&nbsp; I can think of some games that do some of these things well, but none that do all of them well.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Every enemy has a beautifully written and drawn entry in your journal. Credit: Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>The more I played <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>the more I was struck by its sheer ambition. For more reasons than are expedient to reiterate, blockbuster games have felt stagnant, broken or conventional lately. The ones that are operating at this level are often coasting on a prior success or are severely half-baked. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is something new, huge and unique – a AAA non-gacha success story out of China that, though imperfect and messy in its release, does what it does well and is worth taking seriously.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>On Tuesday, Electronic Arts (EA) held its annual Investor Day —  a three-hour presentation intended for its investors to learn more about the company's direction and promises to make them money in the coming year. But you'd be forgiven if you thought this was some sort of AI tech conference given how effusively the technology was brought up and touted as a key component of EA's future.</p><p>While we've known for a while that EA and a number of other gaming companies are experimenting with and investing heavily in AI, it was nonetheless a bit overwhelming just how often AI came up throughout the entire presentation. It was mentioned it just about every single segment in some capacity, had its own dedicated segment near the end, and was described during CEO Andrew Wilson's introductory speech as "the very core of our business" — a rather shocking new mission statement for a company that ostensibly makes and publishes video games.</p><p>We watched the entirety of the three-hour Investor Day presentation, and did our best to round up all the AI "highlights" in an effort to paint a picture of what, exactly, EA is doing with AI and what we can expect to see in the coming years if its investments and interest in the tech pan out.</p><h2>Core of the Business</h2><p>The first mention of AI in the presentation took place right at the top, in Andrew Wilson's opening speech. In addition to referring to AI as "the very core of our business" and "not merely a buzzword," he announced that EA apparently has over 100 active "novel AI projects" in the works right now, ranging from the practical to the very experimental. Wilson divvied these up into three categories: efficiency, expansion, and transformation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-28-53-screenshot-1726682740176.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Andrew Wilson at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wilson describes the "efficiency" projects as not just cost-saving, but related to doing things faster, cheaper, and at "higher quality." Specifically, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">he cites College Football 25</a>, saying the developers could not have made the game's 150 different stadiums and over 11,000 player likenesses without AI.</p><p>Wilson elaborated by saying he believes AI can give developers "richer colors" to paint "more brilliant worlds" and make characters with "more depth and intelligence" while offering "more authenticity and deeper immersion" to the company's sports games. And for transformation, Wilson describes this as looking into the future and finding entirely new kinds of experiences that don't currently exist in games, especially around user-generated content. </p><p>Chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya went into more depth about what the "transformation" element will mean for EA in a later section, but Wilson's opener made it clear that he's more than bullish on the technology.</p><h2>AI Examples</h2><p>In the talks that followed, a number of EA leads highlighted ways in which EA was already working with AI tech in its existing games. Laura Miele, president of EA entertainment, technology, and central development, talked about something called The Sims Hub, the first AI features coming to The Sims universe. EA plans to release a platform with "supercharged discovery tools" that use AI to allow players to find user-generated content more easily. She showed off an AI application that uses a photo search feature, allowing users to drop in photos of real life houses and then find user-generated houses that look similar to them. Miele also highlighted how the AI can be used for character creation, with users able to drop in an image of a celebrity or person in a certain outfit and then generate a Sim that matches up. Miele says The Sims Hub will be released "soon."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-55-58-screenshot-1726682542759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Laura Miele speaking about The Sims Hub at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>On the internal tech side, Miele talked about EA's asset library, which she described as "like the Smithsonian of game assets." Essentially, EA has a massive database of assets from all of its games and work behind the scenes over the years, and it's using it to train its machine learning capabilities and large language models. Those capabilities are then being used by the company's "SEED" innovation lab, aka "Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division", for things like EA's "Script to Scene" tool.</p><p>Script to Scene lets developers "create characters, direct performances, and define worlds all from text." Miele shows an example on screen, prompting an AI chat assistant to "build me a Parisian-style residential building." She then asks to make it taller, changes it to a modern high rise, and expands it into a larger neighborhood. With Script to Scene, Miele claims EA developers could eventually make an entire scene in a game using simple text prompts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-3-4-screenshot-1726682599723.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Laura Miele explains Script to Scene at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>After Miele, president of EA Sports Cam Weber took the stage to talk about, well, EA Sports. He showed off the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc-25-fc-iq-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already announced FC IQ</a>, which uses "tactical AI" and real-world data to more accurately simulate how players and teams play together in EA Sports FC 25. And he highlighted Wilson's prior statements about using AI in College Football 25, noting that the stadium creator AI tools in particular reduced creation time "by about 70%" and allowed developers to focus on building the "pageantry" and unique traditions of each school instead. "The investment in these tools and tech will benefit the rest of our portfolio in the months and years ahead," he said.</p><p>And finally, chief experience officer David Tinson briefly talked about an early prototype of a predictive simulation tool EA is working on. He claims the tool will combine EA game data, AI, and IQ ratings to allow users to run more accurate simulations and answer questions of which team would win in a match, who would have won in a hypothetical match, and which team is the best.</p><h2>Cardboard boxes and AI soccer stars</h2><p>If all that somehow wasn't enough AI chatter for you, chief strategy officer Mihir Vaidya took the stage next to talk about AI and nothing but. He opened by comparing the technology to the advent of makeup tutorial videos and cat videos, which he says people initially dismissed as trivial or niche, but now are ubiquitous and wildly popular. He says EA's experimental AI efforts should be viewed the same way as "early YouTube videos", and that while what he shows might feel rudimentary, it will naturally get better as AI improves.</p><p>Vaidya was specifically brought onstage to talk about the "transformation" portion of AI that Wilson mentioned earlier. He says the experiences he shows onstage are "not intended to replace AAA games, but instead unlock new and adjacent categories that add as opposed to take away from the existing gaming market."</p><p>Those "new and adjacent categories" Vaidya wanted to show off largely seem to involve apps of some sort that let people use AI to shuffle around EA proprietary assets and spit out minigames of a sort. One example he shows involves two people asking an AI to "make a maze out of cardboard boxes." They then ask the AI to make it more complex, then multi-level. Then they ask the AI to "make two characters with weapons," allowing them to select from a gallery of existing EA characters before settling on two that purport to be community-designed, then equip them with guns from a library of weapons. They then select from a handful of game modes and start chasing each other around the cardboard maze. The video ends with one of them asking the AI to "make it more epic," resulting in a giant cardboard box pyramid seemingly appearing in real-time to the astonishment of the two players.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-2-12-25-screenshot-1726682289456.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of an AI experiment at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a second demonstration, Vaidya wants to demonstrate how AI can be used to create "more believable characters" that players care about even more. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see much of that in action, as Vaidya encourages investors to check out the demo at the investor event after the presentation is over. But we do see a few seconds of what he's talking about: an AI version of soccer star Jude Bellingham is apparently available to answer questions posed by investors using AI to simulate his likeness, voice, and likely responses. Vaidya demonstrates by asking him what it was like to play at Bernabéu "in front of millions of screaming fans." Bellingham briefly explains the indescribable thrill of the experience in a flat monotone, expressionless.</p><p>Finally, Vaidya demonstrates how EA wants to use AI for "social ecosystems", specifically something codenamed Project AIR. Project AIR seems to be a way to use short text prompts to generate characters, have text-based interactions with them, and then share those conversations with friends. In his example, he creates a "legendary investor" character using the prompt, "A high-stakes VC who swims in the deep waters of innovation." </p><p>He then decides the "game" will be to pitch business ideas to him. In an interface that looks suspiciously like Tik-Tok, the user pitches "self-tying shoes" only to be slapped down. He then invites a friend to help him pitch, but lost for any ideas on how to make self-tying shoes more interesting, he uses an AI co-pilot to write the pitch for him, which ultimately succeeds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-2-24-15-screenshot-1726682353881.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A screenshot from an AI experiment at EA's Investor Day 2024</figcaption></figure></output><h2>What does it all mean?</h2><p>That's <em>a lot</em> of noise about AI, almost an astonishing amount even from a company we knew was pushing the tech hard. And it's a lot of noise specifically about <em>generative </em>AI. Artificial intelligence, broadly, has been used in games for decades. But generative AI, which is involved in most of the things EA shared yesterday, is different. Generative AI effectively spits out brand new images, text, sound, or other content based on data it's fed, which has led to numerous ethical questions regarding its use. Some of those EA has managed to answer effectively. For instance, EA is training its AI on its own proprietary material, so there's seemingly no concern about it stealing copyrighted work (we've reached out to EA for comment).</p><p>But other concerns remain. There's the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00478-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmental impact</a>, for one, which we've also asked EA about. And then there's issues of using personal likenesses. EA says Jude Bellingham agreed to let EA train an AI on his likeness and voice for the model we saw yesterday, but will EA ensure it has permission from every single individual it uses in the future? What about voice actors for beloved characters, who are still at this moment on strike from companies including AI over these exact protections? We've asked EA for comment on all this, too.</p><p>On the game development side, how does this implementation of AI impact individual creatives at the company? It's easy to say that tools such as Script to Scene are intended to free up developers to work on other things. But it's a practical reality that the games industry has seen <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">two years of unprecedented layoffs</a> just as AI is beginning to creep into the mainstream, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">EA has been a part of that</a>. There are no guarantees that this tech might not eventually be used to replace developers eventually. Developers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl44mv0jnv5o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have said over and over</a> that they are rightfully nervous about this possibility, but neither EA nor its investors seem to be especially interested in addressing that. Nor does it seem apparent to them the difference between the intentional, creative work of designers assembling a thoughtful map for a shoorter, and anyone at all prompting an AI to spit out a random array of cardboard boxes. It's all content to be sold in the end.</p><p>As some have pointed out online, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-nft-blockchain-future-gaming">EA is no stranger to pushing hard on new tech</a> before immediately <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-not-driving-hard-direction-nfts">backing off the second the wind changed</a>. But this feels different. EA leadership made it abundantly clear at the Investor Day that the company is already very, very deep in on AI even if the experiments themselves are still in their infancy. Investors might be kept happy by these experiments, but perhaps fans of EA's 40-year history as a video game company ought to be asking why AI, not games, has suddenly become the "core" of its business.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
