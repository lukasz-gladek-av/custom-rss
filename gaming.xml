            <p>
Fancy a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> in your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>? Oh, well that's convenient, as the game's Nightmare and Visions update just dropped today, adding in Mortis Trials, a new wave-based game mode. The wave-based nature really is what it says on the tin: scores of enemies come after you round after round, but in this mode you'll get Indulgences, which is just lorespeak for upgrades you can unlock on different runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You'll also start with an archetype that lets you deal elemental damage like electricity or fire, while doing more damage to electrified or burning enemies. Another archetype simply lets you switch or reload weapons faster, and you get a second small buff for the second wave (there's a total of 12 to get through, which doesn't sound easy, but I suppose that's the point). There are also objective waves that take place on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th waves, but you'll have to play to find out what those are like.

Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fatsharkgames">Fatshark</a> released the <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/nightmares-visions-patch-notes">full patch notes</a> for the new update earlier today too, and if you want me to list out every single change, you can jog on, because it's massive. There are a few changes I'll highlight though, just to help you out a bit. For one, Havoc is receiving campaigns, with plans to release new ones with "different mutators and a rotating mission pool" alongside major updates.
</p>
<p>
There's some quality of life changes too, like DLSS 4 support now being a feature in the game, and there's been a bunch of weapon balance tweaks too - possibly worth having a closer look at if your weapon of choice has been affected.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth noting that Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">half off on Steam right now too</a>. Quite convenient with this new update, 'ey?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-teases-venom-twerking-emote-as-in-game-event-reward/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hold onto something solid, because the next Marvel Rivals patch might give players what they want: Venom twerking. Get ready for a surge in Venom’s pick rates, as players look like they’ll finally have the chance to throw it back as the symbiote.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-better-not-be-an-april-fool-s-day-joke">This Better Not Be an April Fool’s Day Joke</h2>



<p>Between April 1st and April 4th, Marvel Rivals players that complete the board in the Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure event will be able to claim a special reward. This “special April Fool’s Easter Egg gift” will unlock a “hidden twist surprise,” but the icon on the board on the game’s website has hinted at what the surprise is. Instead of a question mark, which currently appears in-game in that spot of the event page, the official game site shows an outline of what very much looks like Venom throwing it back.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the outline technically only shows a large, muscular frame with a prominent set of glutes, many players are zeroing in on it being Venom. The “Venom twerk” emote has been a running gag amongst Marvel Rivals players, with many fans online requesting it. Many didn’t think Netease would actually implement it, but some are still skeptical, believing this to just be an April Fool’s Day prank. Still it would be cruel to promise such a cosmetic and not deliver. In order to be eligible to receive the reward, whatever it is, you’ll have to collect all rewards from Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure board.</p>



<p>Cosmetics overall <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been the major focal point behind Marvel Rivals’ live-service business model</a>, especially the hero costumes. While not all of this is directly attributed to Marvel Rivals, Netease said in February that it saw <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/marvel-rivals-40-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.9 billion revenue</a> during the previous financial quarter, up 1.5%. An estimate from Chinese outlet Gamelook from January said that the game alone had brought in around $136 million.</p>



<p>If the Venom twerking emote is real, will you be picking it up? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gunzilla<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former Game Informer staff announced today that the site and magazine are coming back, following their abrupt closure by owner GameStop<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> last August</a>. The entire staff at the time of the shutdown will return, and, after the contents of its website were <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely taken offline</a>, the Game Informer site is back online too.&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoVfBvxKdm0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>, executive editor Kyle Hilliard says that the returning staff includes “production, design, video, editorial–everybody.” The team has also regained access to Game Informer’s social media and video accounts, and the website currently hosts new articles written during the site’s hiatus, as well as older pieces. Staff say the magazine will be coming back in both print and digital. Game Informer will have “memberships and subscriptions,” with more information forthcoming.&nbsp;</p><p>Game Informer was purchased by <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunzilla Games</a>, though staff say it operates as a separate entity. In a <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/news/63-Gunzilla-Games-Acquires-Game-Informer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Gunzilla writes that "Game Informer remains completely editorially independent," with CEO Vlad Korolov saying,“We are proud to welcome the talented voices behind Game Informer in the Gunzilla Games family, and join their fight to preserve the heart of video game journalism in what has been a tumultuous time for the industry."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Game Informer Is Back And The Entire Team Has Returned" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eoVfBvxKdm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p> “Editorial independence has been foundational for Game Informer ever since it was started back in the 90s, and it will continue to be a sacred element of our operation going forward,” says executive editor Brian Shea in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Editor-in-chief Matt Miller says that “all of Game Informer’s editorial content is 100% selected by our editorial team without any outside influence, including from the new owners. In fact, that editorial integrity is something that the new owners insisted upon as strongly as we did.”</p><p>Gunzilla’s first game is a free-to-play extraction shooter called <a href="https://gameoffthegrid.com/#about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Off The Grid</em></a>, currently in early access. <em>Off The Grid</em> features what Gunzilla <a href="https://gameoffthegrid.com/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls</a> “an optional NFT element;” as such, on PC it’s only available on the Epic Games Store, as per <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s rules</a>. Gunzilla is also developing <a href="https://gunbygunz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GUNZ</a>, which it calls in a&nbsp; <a href="https://gunzillagames.com/de/news/55-Gunzilla-Games-Announces----M-in-Funding-Co-Led-by-CoinFund-and-Avalanche" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> press release “a blockchain-based digital economy platform built to allow Gunzilla and even other AAA game developers to empower players with full ownership of in-game items as tradable NFTs.” That press release also highlights funding from several investment funds dedicated to crypto, web3, and the blockchain. Game Informer's former owner GameStop also dabbled in NFTs, launching a marketplace in 2022 and <a href="https://decrypt.co/212944/rise-fall-gamestop-nft-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting it down in 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I won’t say the idea of a Game Informer potentially resurrected by crypto money isn’t a bit of a bummer, I’m hopeful about the video’s assertion of editorial independence, and excited by how many staff they’ve brought back. On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itsvanaken.bsky.social/post/3lla4exnbgk2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky,</a> senior video editor Alex Van Aken noted that “We’ve all received huge raises and many of us long-overdue <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleyleblanc.bsky.social/post/3lla5fpftik2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promotions</a>,” which is certainly something you don’t hear every day in games journalism. After their <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gamestop-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rough treatment</a> at the hands of GameStop, I’m excited to see what the team does.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-co-founder-opens-new-studios-with-loads-of-ex-blizzard-folks">Back in 2020</a>, co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> Mike Morhaime formed Dreamhaven, essentially Blizzard 2, albeit a bit more explicit in the fact that it has different studios working under it. One of said studios, Secret Door, is currently working on co-op strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunderfolk">Sunderfolk</a>, and today as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k&amp;ab_channel=thegameawards">showcase</a> presented by The Game Awards, the other studio Moonshot Games revealed its first title: Wildgate, a sci-fi shooter that sees you piloting ships around space looking for loot as you face off against other players.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The way it works is that in each match, you and crews of other players are after an artifact, each of you with your own ship you use to get to your destination. Sometimes you'll have to use said ship to fight against other players, though while the reveal trailer offered a look at space combat, it wasn't too detailed. It looks like all the ships have shields and turrets to shoot at each other with, and you can even disembark your own ship to go and board an enemies' one. Looks pretty neat honestly! Not sure how I feel about it being match based, but hey, can't win 'em all.

<p>
Your crew is made up of prospectors, like that one guy voiced by Kelsey Grammer in Toy Story 2, all of which have different abilities and tools, typical hero shooter kind of thing. It looks like there's a few different gun options, and even tools to put out fires on your ship. 
</p>
<p>
Again, it doesn't look like there's necessarily anything massively unique on the shooting front, there's only so many different ways you can do a shooter, but it looks fun enough, and I like the character designs. One prospector looks like some kind of axolotl thing in a fishbowl with robot limbs? That'll probably be my main day one.
</p>
<p>
Wildgate doesn't currently have a release date other than sometime this year, i.e. 2025, but you can <a href="https://playtest.playwildgate.com/signup/communitypreview/account">sign-up to playtest it</a> if the trailer piques your interest.

We had both the tabletop and digital versions and would regularly play together. There was something so intriguing about playing through an imaginary "Game of Life" and all of the challenges that came with it. Now that I'm an adult living <em>through</em> the game that is life, I find myself less entranced by the concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is probably why this collaboration with Jurassic Park exists in the first place. The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition is less about living your best life and more about holding onto it. The overall theme of this board game is really quite interesting, and with the price reduced under $20 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-spring-deal-days">Amazon's Spring Deal Days Sale</a>, it's definitely worth considering adding to your collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition Is On Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="292a2064-5743-4d4c-816f-7c9fa568207e" id="217105"><div id="217105" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Game of Life Jurassic Park Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Amazon discount, the Jurassic Park edition of this game actually drops below the price of the original. At just under $20, it's a great price for an officially licensed board game. While this isn't the lowest price we've ever seen on this board game, it is the lowest price we've seen in 2025 so far. If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket and are looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">fun family game</a> to play, this is a great option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The general theme of this game is very different from the original Game of Life. The goal is to hop into your all-terrain vehicle and race your way around the island collecting dinosaur eggs and park rangers before the hurricane hits. Instead of normal life obstacles, you'll be faced with hungry dinosaurs scattered across the board. The first one to make it all the way around the island and escape wins, and the rest are left to get eaten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original Hasbro board game, the Jurassic Park version is meant to be played with 2-4 players. It also has a suggested age rating of 8+, likely because of the whole getting eaten by dinosaurs aspect of the game.

          <p>Nvidia has seen its fortunes soar in recent years as its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/nvidia-unveils-blackwell-b200-the-worlds-most-powerful-chip-designed-for-ai/">AI-accelerating GPUs</a> have become worth their weight in gold. Most people use their Nvidia GPUs for games, but why not both? Nvidia has a new AI you can run at the same time, having just<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-companion-for-rtx-ai-pcs/">&nbsp;released</a> its experimental G-Assist AI. It runs locally on your GPU to help you optimize your PC and get the most out of your games. It can do some neat things, but Nvidia isn't kidding when it says this tool is experimental.</p>
<p>G-Assist is available in the Nvidia desktop app, and it consists of a floating overlay window. After invoking the overlay, you can either type or speak to G-Assist to check system stats or make tweaks to your settings. You can ask basic questions like, "How does DLSS Frame Generation work?" but it also has control over some system-level settings.</p>
<p>By calling up G-Assist, you can get a rundown of how your system is running, including custom data charts created on the fly by G-Assist. You can also ask the AI to tweak your machine, for example, optimizing the settings for a particular game or toggling on or off a setting. G-Assist can even overclock your GPU if you so choose, complete with a graph of expected performance gains.</p>

      Nvidia on G-Assist.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Nvidia demoed G-Assist last year with some impressive features tied to the active game. That version of G-Assist could see what you were doing and offer suggestions about how to reach your next objective. The game integration is sadly quite limited in the public version, supporting just a few games, like <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>There is, however, support for a number of third-party plug-ins that give G-Assist control over Logitech G, Corsair, MSI, and Nanoleaf peripherals. So, for instance, G-Assist could talk to your MSI motherboard to control your thermal profile or ping Logitech G to change your LED settings.</p>

already have Switch 2 dev kits, with Nintendo just expanding the number in June.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1108051871" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

A new report has highlighted the "havoc" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s lack of a release date is causing among game publishers, as they attempt to draw up launch plans for their titles that won't put them on a collision course with Rockstar's all-consuming sequel - with one executive reportedly saying, "We don't want to be anywhere near that."
</p>
<p>
Following comments made by EA's Andrew Wilson earlier this year suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">the publisher would be willing to shift the new Battlefield's release in order to avoid GTA 6</a>, journalist Christopher Dring spoke to a number of industry executives to understand how Rockstar's game was impacting their own decision-making behind the scenes - with the responses he received reflecting those previously expressed by Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">newly launched The Game Business podcast</a>, Dring shared a quote from the boss of "one of the biggest games publishers in the world", who didn't want to go on record. "Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market," the executive told Dring. "We don't want to be anywhere near that. We're working up multiple different plans for our title."

<p>
Another senior executive from a different publisher shared similar sentiments, telling Dring, "Even without GTA, it's immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there."
</p>
<p>
A third senior executive - the European boss of an unnamed triple-A publisher - highlighted additional concerns, specifically around the "fall" launch window previously touted for GTA 6's launch by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>. "We don't want to launch just before or just after the game," the executive explained. "If it arrives in late October, that means you either have to launch early - which a lot of people seem to be doing with the recent glut of summer release dates. Or go later, putting you up against the Black Friday sales."
</p>
<p>
"If we move out of 2025," the executive continued. "what if Rockstar do too? Will we have to push our game up or will we have to delay further? It's proven to be very stressful."
</p>
<p>
Dring said these kind of considerations are currently "causing a bit of havoc" across the games industry, and it's not just a problem for publishers looking to launch new releases; GTA 6's arrival is likely to impact the fortunes of live service games too. One "top 10 live service games" developer told Dring, "GTA 6 is basically a huge meteor and we will stay clear of the blast zone. We will nudge our updates back or forward three weeks to avoid it. Of course, the problem is everyone is going to do the same. So three to four weeks before or after GTA 6, you're going to get a load of live service games dropping content in what they believe will be the safe zone."
</p>
<p>
"It's obviously going to get a little bit messy," Dring observed. But as he also highlighted, history suggests publisher have good reason to be concerned. Looking back to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s launch in September 2013, Dring explained, 50 percent of the month's game revenue was for Rockstar's title - despite it only releasing half-way through September. As for GTA 5's launch week in the UK, Rockstar's game reportedly accounted for 89 percent of all games sold and 94 percent of all video game revenue - and the the title is also said to have accounted for two thirds of all games sold in the UK during the three-week "blast zone" following its release.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But as noted by Game File's Stephen Totilo during The Game Business podcast, there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September - given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.

                <p>Following its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">sudden closure</a> in August 2024, long-running video game magazine Game Informer is officially back. The staff announced the news earlier today in an official <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/letter-from-the-editor/2025/03/25/game-informer-is-back" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, writing, "The whole team has returned, and we can’t wait to connect with you again."</p><p>In the same post, Game Informer editor-in-chief Matt Miller went on to explain that the outlet was given a "new lease on life" following its acquisition by game studio Gunzilla. Furthermore, Gunzilla also rehired the entire team of folks working at Game Informer prior to its closure. Miller stated that because of this rehiring, the team is confident that they can maintain an "unbroken identity of who we are and what we represent."</p><p>Gunzilla, which is currently working on upcoming battle royale game Off the Grid, reportedly assured Game Informer staff that the company will operate independently of the studio, with "100 percent of the decisions around what we cover and how we do so" coming from the site's editorial team. According to Miller, Gunzilla Games sees "the same potential in Game Informer as our team does, and their encouragement to do so ethically and free of outside pressure is laudable."</p><p>In addition to Game Informer's website--which already includes many years of back content in addition to new posts and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/every-review-from-game-informers-hiatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reviews</a> of games that released while the site was shuttered--the outlet has confirmed that its print magazine is returning as well. Miller said the company's intent is to "bring back the magazine bigger and better than it was before, and add a host of membership and subscription benefits, including an expanded scope to our videos, streaming, and feature coverage, while also broadening the range of experts and partnerships we tap to bring you those perspectives." Miller ended the blog post by stating that additional information regarding membership and subscription options is coming, and encouraged those interested to create a new Game Informer account to stay up to date on details.</p><p>Prior to its closure last August, Game Informer was one of the longest-running video game outlets in North America, having launched in 1991. The company was shut down by former parent company GameStop (the video game store, not us!) in a decision that reportedly surprised its entire staff, as they were currently "70% done" with the outlet's next issue.</p>

We've seen a huge amount of workers, both creative, administrative, and technical, suffer massive layoffs and restructurings. Even the teams behind hugely successive games—like the Seattle-based team responsible for part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">Marvel Rivals</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netease-lays-off-marvel-rivals-seattle-developers">—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">have been laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's part of the reason why Retora Games founder and adjunct professor Tyler Coleman has been creating unique class exercises and role play scenarios to help his students think about what sort of problems they might run into after they graduate.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The best lessons come from failure, so how do we teach that in a hands-on way to our classes?" Coleman said, posing a question to an audience at his Game Developers Conference talk. "By not teaching them [these things] we are not preparing our students for the worst."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman has run some of his classes through one of four different experiments, each spanning a the majority of the school term, to prepare students for handling the tough environment of the gig economy, negotiating with unreasonable publishers and clients, dealing with the variety of hardships studios often experience, and handling the emotional toll of being laid off.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Forcing failure with care">Forcing failure with care</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/achieving-creative-sobriety-in-game-design" target="_self" data-discover="true">Achieving 'creative sobriety' in game design</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One point Coleman emphasized before diving into each hands on exercise is that he was looking for feedback and ways to improve. These experiments had "mixed results," according to him and he was wary of negatively impacting his students and the way they viewed their own work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Forcing people to fail should be treated with care," he said. "As you do run a risk of creating real trauma if not planned carefully."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiment that stood out most was Coleman's Rapid Prototyping class, which had a group of students produce multiple small games in various groups throughout the school term. The program ended with the entire class working together on one project, with separate groups of students within the class representing different teams within a AAA studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The whole thing was doomed from the start," Coleman said. "They were using a 5 year old version of Unity they hadn't worked with before. The teacher (me) was intentionally bad with communicating design and intent. We had regular unexpected changes in the design bible."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman had meant for his teams to fail and he—posing as a senior figure in this fictitious studio —was the main antagonist for this experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the end of the program, Coleman held a meeting with all the teams and told them that they were being let go. All the work they produced was owned by the fake company that employed them. He posed a question to his students, what would you do if you couldn't use any of the work from this past term? In reality the work was owned by the students, but he challenged them with a scary possibility that may very well hit them one day.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pros and cons">Pros and cons</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several elements of the experiment went well, according to Coleman. Some of his students felt the emotional toll of losing their jobs. While stressful, it helped them understand that situations like that are often completely out of their control. There was nothing they could have done differently to prevent the layoffs. Many students reacted poorly to the news, but Coleman believed it was good for them to experience it in this type of situation rather than in the real world where they'd have to pay rent and other bills.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It also led them to update their resumes and LinkedIn profiles," he said, emphasizing that he wasn't pro-layoff in any way. "It helped them understand that the best thing you can do is connect to everyone else and build a network."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other elements didn't go as well. Several students thought they had failed the class, which made them panic. The bombshell of the layoff also happened at the very end of the quarter, which completely killed any excitement the class had heading into the end of the term. Luckily the class didn't fail, they received "severance A," according to Coleman. He plans to clearly communicate that the students could not fail this experiment going forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-civilization-vii-s-powerful-narrative-system-helps-players-experience-unique-parts-of-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Civilization VII's powerful narrative system helps players experience unique parts of history</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiments that Coleman ran were unorthodox, but quite relevant in an industry that's repeatedly shown that its workers can be let go at a moments notice to help improve quarter over quarter fiscal showings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coleman detailed a few things that he'd like to do differently going forward, including making some sort of time for actual lecturing as several of his experiments involved his students roleplaying. Those sessions could take hours and often ended up leaving no time for him to talk to his students directly at length about what they were doing, how they felt about it, and what he hoped they would learn.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game design professor also plans to possibly change the schedule of when he plans to "lay off" his students, making sure that it's midway through the term so that he can leave time for retrospectives and feedback and simulate what comes after a layoff—which is usually other opportunities and work.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildgate-hands-on-with-a-20-player-outer-space-fps-that-mixes-sci-fi-with-sea-of-thieves.1144644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-hands-on-with-a-20-player-outer-space-fps-that-mixes-sci-fi-with-sea-of-thieves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess I sorta suspected the day would come when my inner despot would awaken to wreak havoc on the galaxy, but I was surprised just how quickly it went down, after just a few minutes with the upcoming space-faring shooter: Wildgate. This chaotic sci-fi first-person shooter blends PvE and PvP objectives alongside exploration and combat on foot and aboard a ship that requires multiple people to operate – a formula that may feel quite familiar to any fellow Sea of Thieves fans. But unlike Sea of Thieves, where the chaos of player-on-player piracy is a somewhat infrequent and optional distraction, in Wildgate it’s the primary focus, and the inevitable clash of geared-up crews left me feeling the same heart-pounding intensity of a battle royale, as I barked commands at my crewmates and watched my enemies become just another cluster of space debris.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate pits five teams of four players against one another in a competitive space heist where time is of the essence and anything goes in these 20-40 minute brawls. Though there are 20 players in each procedurally generated world, you’re unlikely to run into any rival crews at the outset, instead using the calm before the storm to explore the miniature dungeons scattered throughout the cosmos. By delving into these places, slaying enemies that lie within, solving minor puzzles, and claiming loot, my squad and I gathered upgrades to bring back to our ship, including more powerful turrets, better shielding for our ship, ammo, healing items, and personal weaponry to carry into future battles. But our real purpose behind conquering these places as quickly as possible was to find the one and only Artifact hidden in each map. By collecting this all-important relic, every opposing team would be notified that we’d done so and be given an ongoing ping of our location as well. Then it was a mad dash to the Wildgate, and if we could fend off the enemy long enough to get to it, we’d instantly win the match and leave our adversaries choking on our space dust. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wildgate - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, every single rival player on the map would throw their full weight into preventing our escape, which is where the hilariously fun, full-on chaos of Wildgate shows itself. Though you can respawn infinitely after being killed, if someone destroys your ship, you’re knocked out of the match for good when killed, giving PvP especially high stakes. Ship-to-ship space combat is an intense, highly cooperative effort where you’ll need to share responsibility for piloting, manning mounted weapons, and repairing damage. The tools you’ve looted along the way can make that job easier and can have a pretty profound impact on how you approach combat. For example, on one run my crew found a bunch of close-range turrets that encouraged us to get up close and personal with the enemy to do high damage, while in another match I found a long-range sniper turret that allowed me to chip away at the enemy from a distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you prefer a more subtle approach, you can always jump into space and jetpack your way aboard an enemy ship to blast enemies while they’re focused on piloting the ship, plant bombs to deal massive damage to their hull, steal the artifact out from under their noses if they’ve left it unguarded, or just hit the self-destruct button and defend the area until their core goes nuclear and wipes them out. This can turn the tables on an enemy that has better gear on their ship or has managed to outmaneuver you with their piloting skills by disrupting their ability to manage their vessel and pull focus from other, more pressing objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather not go through the trouble of hunting down an Artifact and racing through the escape gate, then you can do what I did and simply hunt down and eliminate every single enemy crew until you’re the last team standing. They can’t extract the Artifact if they’re dead, after all. This approach can prove especially effective since you’re able to scrap every downed ship for parts to add them to your growing arsenal. And if you’re especially slimy, like me, you can wait to ambush the enemy while they’re busy with a PvE dungeon, blowing up their ship while it’s unmanned, then swooping in to claim the hard-won loot from the area they were in the middle of clearing out. All’s fair in love and space piracy, my friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest, and after more than six hours I still felt like I was only just beginning to figure out the best strategies to pull off a win consistently. For example, I learned the hard way that if you’re chasing an enemy ship who is seconds away from escaping through the Wildgate and you’re bombarding them with everything you’ve got, you should probably make sure you’re standing far enough away to not also blow yourself up in the process, resulting in a draw. Unlocking new characters and gear as you score XP also provides some new options, like the birdlike character, Mophs, whose unique ability to become invisible when boarding enemy ships can be especially useful in pulling off subterfuge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the small taste, I already get the impression that Wildgate will be one of those games where crazy things happen every single match that send me howling to my friends in victory or defeat, then swapping war stories with anyone who will listen the next morning, and if it manages to pull that off, it could very well be my next squad-based obsession.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
