		<p>Rockfish has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everspace-2">Everspace 2</a>: Wrath of the Ancients, a major expansion to their space adventure that adds a new post-game story, more star systems, side quests and more when it launches for PlayStation, Xbox and PC this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | Wrath of the Ancients — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jij3a23hx3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Apparently the community has bugged Rockfish about the Aethon system long enough – to be fair, Rockfish were the ones teasing it – but Aethon will be just one star system within this expansion, in which you’ll explore several star systems from the Okkar civilization.</p>
<p>But who are the Okkar? Well, they’re an emerging faction appearing just as attacks using weapons from the Ancients have sparked a fresh conflict in Cluster 34, using these attacks ostensibly by the Ancients as justification for their own possible hostilities. You and your crew have to head to the Okkar Homeworlds to try and defuse the situation.</p>
<p>This expansion will push the game’s lore ahead, but it will also bring new twists to the combat. You’ll be able to snag an Okkar Wraith ship and use it’s various new abilities against challenging new enemies. Existing ships will also be compatible with the new weapons and gear, including new upgradable Okkar equipment – more details on those at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Everspace 2 was a big change from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/18/everspace-stellar-edition-review/">the original game</a>. That had been a roguelike space adventure, but the sequel morphed into a more traditional narrative led space shooter. We loved the change, with Ade saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/27/everspace-2-review/">Everspace 2 review</a>, “I started Everspace 2 deeply unsure about a space looter shooter. Tens of hours later I don’t want to play anything else. Everspace 2 is a towering achievement of space-based thrills and spills. It absolutely deserves your attention.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Techland <a href="https://youtu.be/CvqFjEILJao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> many announcements as part of its celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. Firstly, the numbers: over 45 million users have played either the first or the second game in the first-person open-world zombie series that originally debuted in 2015, an increase of 15 million since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-franchise-sold-30-million-copies-to-date-techland-busy-on-new-open-world-fantasy-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous announcement from two years ago</a>. During this decade, they have racked up 67 billion zombie kills and over 1 billion hours of total playtime.</p>
<p>To commemorate the tenth anniversary, the first and second games will feature a series of events over four weeks. In the first week, Dying Light will get HyperMode with a double XP bonus, while the sequel will enjoy the biggest discount ever (up to 67%, depending on the platform and region). In the following weeks, the original game will be refreshed with the Low Gravity, Super-Crane, and Viral Rush events, while Dying Light 2 players will be able to take advantage of new bounties via the Pilgrim Outpost website. In the fourth week, the sequel is also finally receiving the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid cooperative roguelike mode</a> as a permanent addition to the game, following several playtest rounds.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10th-Anniversary-celebration-roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg revealed today for the franchise. The first Dying Light will soon receive a new patch that improves visuals and adds a remastered soundtrack with new music from the original composer Paweł Błaszczak. Of course, most of the content is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a>, which is roughly in the middle of its promised five-year post-launch support. The updated roadmap for 2025 shows co-op gameplay and matchmaking improvements, new playable Tower Raid characters, improved Community Maps support, new firearms and melee weapons, an entirely new weapon class, improvements to the Prologue, graphical and technical improvements, and, of course, free gear and outfits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Dying-Light-2025-Roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's still not everything Techland talked about today. The Polish developer confirmed they've got <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, which will mark the return of original game protagonist Kyle Crane, slated for the Summer season. Moreover, there are some unannounced Dying Light projects in the works, as well as new board games, exclusive merchandise, and an original webcomic series.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight released a new trailer for Split Fiction, a title that was announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-announced-at-the-game-awards-releases-march-6-2025/">The Game Awards</a>. This is the new game coming from the ambitious studio that made It Takes Two. This game is set to push the boundaries of a co-op adventure, where players can jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds while exploring their own side stories in a journey of discovery. If you want to see the new trailer for Split Fiction, you can find it down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you get glimpses into the story, Josef Fares, the founder of Hazelight walks you through the co-op scenarios that you can participate in and the varying gameplay that you'll get to experience. In addition to the co-op gameplay that you'll get to see in Split Fiction, the trailer also talks about a special feature called Side Stories. These are one-off adventures that you can do that are hidden throughout the main story levels, providing a shake-up to the mechanics and allowing you to learn more about the personalities and stories of Mio and Zoe.</p>
<p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the EA website, Side Stories happen as a result of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. The portals that appear are attempts to steal Mio and Zoe's unfinished stories from when they were younger. As a result, this leads to a lot of wacky situations that they will get to traverse together. These include riding Sandfish across a desert and performing tricks while under heavy fire. Others include becoming pigs and finding out how sausages are made. With these Side Stories, it's set to provide a lot of laughs and questionable moments as you get to explore the game.</p>
<p>Much like A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' has promised that the Friend's Pass will be back for Split Fiction, too. This means that one player who owns the game can invite a friend to play the game for free. In addition, Hazelight also has plans to add crossplay, allowing friends to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 6, 2025. The game will be priced at $49.99.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Split Fiction when it releases? Let us know in the comments.</p>

In regular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a> for plague doctors, or possibly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a>: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  
</p>
<p>
Over <em>here</em> is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over <em>there</em> is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

I spent around an hour with Kingdoms today ahead of launch, and while I'm not sure it'll rejuvenate your interest if you're absolutely sick of Darkest Dungeon 2, it feels well-wrought. Briefly, it's a turn-based digital boardgame with a worker placement element, in which you travel back and forth between upgradeable inns to stave off sieges and complete quest objectives in the face of an escalating threat. It begins with a choice of layouts and difficulty settings (see below). Then you compose a starting party at the Crossroads and set off through a relatively laidback borderlands region, as in vanilla Donkey's Dingdong 2.

<p>
Having reached and liberated the inn at the end of that trail, you're cut loose upon the full playing board. Pretty much every turn, at least one of the map's inns comes under siege from dark forces (that's the berserking Beastmen at first, with other factions to be unlocked). It'll fall in a handful of turns, depending on how much you've strengthened it using construction resources gathered on the road. You can rumble over to assist the inn, which means surviving any hazards enroute, or you can send one of the supporting heroes you've stationed at other inns to rally the defenders and drag out the siege. 
</p><p>
The trips between map nodes are similar to the regions of the main game - you steer your stagecoach with WASD according to a murky minimap, attempting to siphon loot from roadside nasties without stressing or damaging your heroes too much - but the paths between inns seem much shorter, with fewer branches, encounters and bosses. </p>
<p>This is compensated by the fact that you might have to string together a few regional runs to reach your destination. Some roads lead to campsites, which afford you rest but don't offer progression facilities or protection against nocturnal ambush. There's also what I think is a new fatigue mechanic that lowers hero max health based on how far they've travelled. As such, you'll want to shuffle people out of your hand now and then, stationing exhausted party members at inns to recuperate.</p>
<p>In amongst all this, you'll need to complete those quest objectives before all the inns fall and the map's threat level becomes unmanageable. During my opening game, this started with transporting a telescope to a watchtower so that I could map out the Beastfolk menace.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Red Hook / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The ability to leave heroes at the inn together with the campsites recalls the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s town/dungeon format, but this isn't just a DD1 mode within DD2, obviously. It reminds me more of the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a>, in that you have some pervading strategic capacity but are fundamentally lost within a large, weird world.
</p><p>
The Kingdoms map has all of Red Hook's usual thickly etched floridity, but I could do with, dare I say, a bit more illumination. I'm not asking for Dirkest Dragon to suddenly come over all Wind Waker, but after hundreds of hours in this setting, I'm ready for some refreshed presentation. IDK. What would a Lightest Dungeon look like? How would you maintain the essential dungeoniness in a universe without shadow? It's a deeply perverse question, and one I will therefore be asking Red Hook as and when they fail to avoid encountering me at an expo.
</p>

<p>
I've enjoyed what I've played of Kingdoms. If you don't, the better news is that it's launching alongside a new regular (paid) Darkest Dungeon 2 DLC pack, Inhuman Bondage. This adds the underground Catacombs region and a new hero, the Abomination, whose air of self-loathing and Hulkish tendencies you may again recognise from Darkest Dungeon 1. The OG Abomination was one of my favourites. He's pretty reliable even in sulky human form, chain-whipping skulls and spewing gastric juices from the midline. Mind you, I would always overdo it with his monster transformations and cause another party member to freak out. I'm not sure how the DD2 incarnation differs.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Inhuman Bondage additions will also be available in Kingdoms. I haven't encountered them yet myself, but there are underground shortcuts to discover between certain inns, and I imagine that's where you'll get your fill of Catacombing.
</p>
<p>
What's next for Dankest Sturgeons? Anything and everything and nothing and something. "We've spent over a decade working on Darkest Dungeon," the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/503940938959159876?l=english">write on Steam</a>. "We've delighted in our explorations and iterations, and we're nowhere near done."

		<p>First of all, congratulations to Austin's Eagles. </p><p><em>Please</em> go beat the damn Chiefs.</p><p>I am writing this wondering if danger is on the horizon. This morning, my four-year-old woke up with a sniffle. She seemed fine otherwise—but you never know. It's a dangerous time of year to be a parent, where those pesky germs are always afoot. I recently joked to my wife that we're due to get sick—we have dodged everything that's taken down our kids this winter season—but I'm crossing my fingers, folks!</p><p>-pk, who cannot believe how boring <em>Gladiator 2</em> was, what the heck</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Interview</em> — Ah, this one is a delight. I'm glad this game together, and hope we have Chris on in the future, as well. When Chris got on the call, he started by saying some version of "Ah, man, I'm sorry" and I was confused on why. Turns out I've tuned out so much of the early Trump bullshit that I wasn't even aware that I'd booked a recording time with the inauguration that was happening at the same time moment. I preferred this version of events, even if we were also talking about a lot of awful things here, too.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>New on Steam</em> – We'll probably change the title of this, but I experimented with this idea recently, where there is <em>so much stuff</em> added to Steam on a daily basis—and so much goes unnoticed. Yes, a lot of it isn't very good and <em>a shocking amount</em> is porn, but my hope is that we can find some diamonds hidden about. Join us as we scroll through Steam and find games!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Remap Recommends</em> – It's the end of the month, which means we'll run through some of the games that have stuck around our brains.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Motorsports Manager</em> – Once more, into the racing breach.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Yep, we're doing a third GOTY pod. My hope is that half of the podcast will also be a normal Remap Radio podcast. Stay tuned!</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – There will be words exchanged between myself and Rob. I need to figure out what the idea is for this week. This is also...stay tuned!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. So it’s important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live.</p>



<p>Quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and growth outlooks for the months and years ahead. Microsoft is the second-largest company in the world in terms of market cap, but quarterly reviews can swiftly change the public and private perception of the company.</p>



<p>What is Microsoft’s focus? What are investors looking for? Are there any concerns or roadblocks? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-microsoft-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Microsoft Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p>Microsoft is currently scheduled to deliver its second quarter (Q2) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Wednesday, January 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its second quarter earnings in January, Microsoft’s fiscal year runs from July 1-June 30. The company’s second quarter runs from October 1 – December 31. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q2: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q3: January 1 – March 31</li>



<li>Q4: April 1 – June 30</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-microsoft-earnings-report-start-time">Next Microsoft Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Microsoft earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5:30PM ET/2:30PM PT on January 29, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-microsoft-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Microsoft’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Microsoft’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via Microsoft’s website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations page</a> on Microsoft’s website</li>



<li>In the menu bar, select “Earnings &amp; Financials”</li>



<li>Then select “Press Release &amp; Webcast”</li>



<li>This will take you to the most recent earnings report page with the press release. On the right-hand side will be options to read the transcript (after the call), listen to the webcast, view the earnings slides, read financial statements, see product releases for the quarter, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you just want to listen to the call without any other information, you’ll want to scroll down on the Investor Relations page to the Upcoming/Past Events section. If it’s not listed in the most recent calls, click “More Past Events”. From there, scroll to the call you’d like to listen to and click the “Webcast” link to listen to the call.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-for-xbox">What To Expect For Xbox</h2>



<p>When Microsoft releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox business</a>. Details such as general gaming revenue, Xbox content and services revenue, Xbox hardware revenue, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cloud gaming</a>, Xbox Game Pass growth, Activision Blizzard King’s impact, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-microsoft-earnings-report">The Last Microsoft Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Microsoft announced its earnings for Q1 FY2025, it revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch in franchise history. Microsoft also said that the company set a record for the most Xbox Game Pass sign ups in a single day for the launch of the new game.</p>



<p>Regarding overall Xbox revenue, Microsoft said that it increased by 61% year-over-year with 53 points of net impact—53 of the 61%—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-responds-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming from Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-quarterly-earnings-calls">What Are Quarterly Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often release a full media deck and press release with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-next-era-of-dying-light%E2%80%99-revealed-as-techland-celebrates-10th-anniversary.1093026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has lined up an impressive 2025 roadmap for Dying Light 2, and it all begins with a celebration event honouring the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, this open-world epic of a zombie apocalypse title made its way onto our screens and into our hearts, and today, it remains one of the best zombie games to ever be released.</p>



<p>From today, the anniversary celebration commences, with Techland pushing out four weeks of entertainment across both Dying Light and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hard-at-work">‘Hard at Work’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, we are already hard at work on the next era of the franchise.</p>



<p>Our recent major rebrand aims to establish the franchise as the ultimate zombie experience across all future projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This summer, the team will release Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone game that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the iconic protagonist from the first game. At Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I caught up with Roger Craig Smith</a>, the legendary actor behind Kyle Crane, who returns to the Dying Light series after a ten-year break.</p>



<p>To kick off the celebrations, Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be discounted to the lowest price ever, per the Techland update. Those still playing Dying Light (2015) will get a free skin bundle and a special ‘hypermode’ event, too. After that, both Dying Light 2 and Dying Light will have special, in-game events unravel, including the return of fan-favourite modes like Low Gravity and Super Crane.</p>



<p>In the week starting February 19, Dying Light 2’s Tower Raid mode will be permanently released, and a special ‘Light up the Night’ stream will be held by Techland.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But that’s not all!</p>



<p>Beyond that, the spring welcomes a major update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and in the summer, a fresh event will be delivered. In the fall comes the ‘Fall Update’ which goes hand-in-hand with a limited-time Halloween event, and finally, Winter Tales returns at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Throughout all that, Dying Light 2 players will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op gameplay and matchmaking updates</li>



<li>New Tower Raid characters</li>



<li>New firearms and melee weapons</li>



<li>Community map support</li>



<li>Prologue improvements</li>



<li>Free outfits and gear</li>



<li>Technical and graphical improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a busy year for the team at Techland, and the press release finished with a promising statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our plans to grow the franchise don’t stop at Dying Light: The Beast. We’ll continue the series with multiple unannounced projects and will also go beyond video games with new board games, exclusive merchandise, original webcomic series and more on the horizon. Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people.</p>
</blockquote>

In theory, nothing would stop players from creating a third-party marketplace on a subreddit or Discord server where people who have tons of duplicates sell them to the highest bidders. </p><p>That’s possibly one reason why the development team is restricting <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s trading feature to one-star cards and below. The rarest cards, like specific gold variants <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">with only a .053 percent chance of dropping</a></span>, will remain locked to players accounts. They would still be able to sell entire accounts to one another, but that would sort of defeat the whole purpose of playing the game and collecting cards in the first place.</p><p>Of course, all of this is violates <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s rules, but that’s never been enough to completely stamp out cheating and other illicit practices in other economy-driven live-service games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. The proof will be in how many players <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> potentially ends up banning for this sort of thing, and if it publicizes those numbers as has become common across lots of other online games. </p><p>The <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>-inspired set Space-Time Smackdown arrives this week, alongside the new trading feature, but those cards will also be excluded from trades at launch. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have said exchanging cards with friends will only be available for existing the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets at the moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of life’s little joys is learning<strong> how many satchels for a sheet metal door</strong> in Rust. It’s a memorable moment, your first-ever raid against your neighbor, and likely to stick with you. In the early game, you likely won’t craft a metric ton of explosive ammo, and C4 is still a few workbenches away, but a satchel is easily accessible and open to most skill levels. Here’s how many it takes to get through your neighbor’s front door!</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>Assuming your raid target upgraded to a sheet metal door, which most Rust players should do immediately after building a base of any size, it will take a few satchels to blow through. In total, you need four satchels for a sheet metal door in Rust. That’s not many, and crafting satchels is not overly expensive. But hey, that’s just door number one!</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Door Type</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Satchels</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wooden Door</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sheet Metal Door</td><td data-align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Garage Door</td><td data-align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Armored Door</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A sheet metal door has 250 health points and is more damage-resistant. A single satchel will deal approximately 61 HP damage to the door. As such, it requires a minimum of four satchels, with 6 HP leftover on the door after the fourth explosion, so you could waste a fifth satchel or use explosive ammo to blast the last few HP. Basically, hit it with anything else. Don’t waste a fifth satchel!</p>



<p>If you’re playing in a group, which Rust genuinely promotes, try to farm for C4. It’s a much better tool for raiding in Rust.</p>

                <p>There was a point in time when it would have been unthinkable for Xbox-exclusive titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo or Gears of War to ever make the leap to PlayStation 5</a>. But the recent cross-platform push by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer may make those rumors into a reality. Now, Thomas Mahler--the creative director of Moon Studios and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review/1900-6416053/" data-ref-id="1900-6416053">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/1900-6417425/" data-ref-id="1900-6417425">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a>--has endorsed Spencer's approach and suggested that it may be what's best for the video game industry.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883273827284599091" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy post on X</a>, Mahler argued that it no longer makes sense for Xbox and PlayStation consoles to compete when the hardware is so similar and the user base is "stuck attracting the same 100-150 [million] players for over two decades now." He argues that the key to growth is to make it easier for players to get their desired games regardless of which console they buy... with the exception of Nintendo, which doesn't have to play by anyone else's rules. Mahler added that "rooting for one huge corporation to sell more boxes over another strikes me as fantastically senseless... We should all just share in the love for games!"</p><p>For now, Spencer's platform agnostic position has not been adopted by Sony, but Mahler suggested that the PlayStation maker has already bent towards that reality by bringing its exclusive titles to PC, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-ps5-exclusive-hits-pc-in-march/1100-6529029/" data-ref-id="1100-6529029">recently announced Rise of the Ronin port</a>.</p><p>"We'll see how long Sony will keep limiting their software sales to one platform," <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883284453251813472" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote Mahler</a>. "There's a reason why they’re already releasing some games on PC now. It's money. They can probably ignore Xbox for now, since Xbox Series hasn't sold all that well, but that might change if Xbox makes a great console again. If they end up with a better machine than whatever the next PlayStation is and if players adopt that, Sony's platform-exclusive strategy is history."</p><p>Some of the most prominent cross-platform titles that are confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 from Xbox-affiliated studios include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-be-the-end-of-the-series/1100-6529013/" data-ref-id="1100-6529013">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Microsoft also owns Activision, which released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's best-selling game</a> across all consoles in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. The upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">launch of Nintendo's Switch 2</a> may also help the industry grow this year, and Spencer has already pledged that Microsoft will support the new console as well.</p>

			<p>It was announced that the first batch of third-party games will be arriving on the Epic Games Store on mobile. So far, there are nearly 20 third-party games available on the client, with games like Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe now on Android worldwide and i<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">OS in the European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside the third-party games being added to the mobile version of the store, they have also announced the free games program on mobile, allowing those who want the opportunity to redeem their free game in the store and keep it forever. At the moment, Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee is available to obtain on Android and iOS through the Epic Games Store mobile app until February 20. Bloons TD 6 will also be added to the program. As they get underway, there will be new games offered each month, and they will eventually move to a weekly schedule later on in the year.</p>
<p>The catalog of third-party titles consists of games such as Evoland 2 and Blade of God X: Orisols, with games like Eastern Exorcist and Mr Rider coming in the near future.</p>
<p>While the new third-party games are the main focus of the announcement from Epic, they've also added some new app features for iOS and Android. This includes Epic Account login, with a persistent status across Epic's games on iOS and Android. For those who want to, they've also added a new auto-update feature, meaning you can jump into your games without having to wait for them to update.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've made some announcements for the developers out there who are considering using the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store to publish their titles</a>. Epic has confirmed that the terms they carry for the PC version of their app carry over to mobile, including the 88/12 revenue share for payments and 0% on third-party payments.</p>
<p>The Launch Everywhere with Epic program was recently released, where it offers a royalty rate reduction from 5% to 3.5% on all platforms and stores for eligible Unreal Engine games that are published on the Epic Games Store from 2025 onwards. In order to be eligible for this, the games must ship on the Epic Store before or at the same time it's released on other stores. By doing this, it's helping the developers maximize their profits from releasing the game and having its initial run in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Will you be playing any of the third-party titles on mobile with Epic Games Store? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull And Bones</a>. All this less than two months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">jettisoning</a> the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 "As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site," reads a statement sent to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-185-layoffs-as-it-closes-former-dj-hero-studio-and-downsizes-others/">VGC</a>. "Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft are currently in rather dire straits. Their share price fell precipitously last year, thanks in part to mixed reactions to Star Wars Outlaws. Earlier this month, their executive board <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">announced</a> that they were not only delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to boost its chances, but "[appointing] leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In short, they might be about to sell the company off.
</p>
<p>
It's claimed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">Bloomberg</a> that the company's founding Guillemot brothers and Chinese publishers Tencent - both minority stakeholders - are trying to found a new venture of some kind made up of Ubisoft corporate assets.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Leamington used to be FreeStyleGames, founded in 2002 by former Rare and Codemasters developers. They made break-dancing sim B-Boy for the PSP. Activision bought them in 2008 and put them to work on various music games, including the well-regarded DJ Hero in 2009 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> Live in 2015. Amid declining interest in peripheral-based rhythm games, Activision cut FreeStyle back and eventually sold them to Ubisoft in 2017. Since then, they've worked alongside Newcastle-based Ubisoft Reflections as a support studio.
</p><p>
Other Ubisoft developers have been paying tribute to the team on social media, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a> narrative director Lauren Stone. "If you liked the Classified Assignments, the Leamington Spa team led that feature," she <a href="https://x.com/laurenistone/status/1883914722195694027">wrote</a>. "It was a pleasure to work with them, and I consider this a huge loss. They were some of my favorite collaborators. I hope they find safe harbors soon to set anchor."
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to everybody affected by all this, in Leamington, Newcastle, Düsseldorf, Stockholm and elsewhere.

<p>Into The Breach, a United Kingdom-based esports organization, is winding down its operations due to its CEO’s embezzling of funds, leaving the organization in an “unsustainable” position. According to one of the organization’s CS2 players, the CEO “scammed” players out of thousands.</p>



<hr>



<p>Per an <a href="https://x.com/ITBesports/status/1883909874561831187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from the organization, an investigation into the company began after “recent events…highlighted significant mismanagement.” ITB discovered that “an individual entrusted with all financial and monetary decisions was embezzling funds.”</p>



<p>On X, ITB CS2 player Owen “smooya” Butterfield <a href="https://x.com/smooyacs/status/1883910676902769137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> the finger at CEO Sam “STM” Macedonio, claiming he was the one laundering money and scamming $500,000 from his own players. In his own post on X, Macedonio <a href="https://x.com/SlayTheMinotaur/status/1883911595975233999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted fault</a>, owing the decisions he made to a “destructive, alcoholic narcissist” side of him “hellbent on self-immolation.” Macedonio noted there will be “several legal consequences” that he will accept and face.</p>



<p>In the replies of his post, Macedonio said that Into The Breach made around £5.5 million between 2023 and 2024. He said that he took around £600,000 in “director’s loans,” which he claims he blew on “benders and self-harm action.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In his post, Macedonio made mention of the breakout moment for Into The Breach, when the relatively unknown organization surprised the Counter-Strike world with a playoff run at the BLAST Paris Major in 2023. The success brought on by that run prompted the organization to return to Dota 2 and Rainbow Six, and also enter competitive Halo for the first time.</p>



<p>Both Into The Breach and Macedonio have said that any available funds will be given to players who have lost money. All players across the various ITB esports divisions will now become free agents.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Koei Tecmo Games is finally delivering a PC port for the popular open-world action RPG Rise of the Ronin on March 11, 2025. This guide will take you through the minimum and recommended system requirements for Rise of the Ronin.</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin was released for PS5 in 2024, where players got to experience this open-world action RPG for the first time. The game is set in Japan’s Edo period, where you shape your destiny by interacting with actual historical figures and learning their ideologies. The game’s highlight was its gameplay, with players instantly falling in love with the plethora of combat styles available for the title’s various weapons. Additionally, the world created by Team Ninja is nothing short of beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-system-requirements">Rise of the Ronin PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>To experience Rise of the Ronin on PC in all its beauty, the developers have provided a set of minimum and recommended system requirements. However, players will need 16 GB of RAM, 180 GB of SSD Storage Space and a broadband internet connection to run the game on either set of requirements. Additional notes state that “poor SSD performance may affect gameplay”, and multi-channel memory architecture is recommended. </p>



<p>Check out Rise of the Ronin PC’s minimum and recommended specifications per the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements are not very demanding. Players only need an Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) GPU. This minimum set of requirements will allow Rise of the Ronin to run at 1080p/30FPS.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i5-10400 or better, AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or better, AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB of RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">180 GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Audio</td><td data-align="center">16-bit stereo with 48KHz playback</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 64bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX Version</td><td data-align="center">DirectX 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Network</td><td data-align="center">Broadband Internet Connection </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended">Recommended </h3>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC’s recommended system requirements allows players to experience the game at 1080p/60FPS under the standard graphics settings (upscaled). The recommended CPU and GPU specifications aren’t very high either, with the player needing an Intel Core i5-10600K/AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super (VRAM 8GB)/AMD Radeon RX 6700XT (VRAM 12GB), respectively. The recommended requirements will allow players to experience Rise of the Ronin as the developers intended. </p>

                <p>A new trailer for the next EA Originals game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, has gone live and shows off more of the Hazelight-developed game in action. Narrated by game director Josef Fares, the gameplay trailer shows off two levels--one set in a sci-fi world, the other in a fantasy land--and how players will use unique co-op gameplay elements in each one to progress. For the sci-fi level, there are anti-gravity sections and bike chases to look forward to, while the fantasy level features shape-shifting gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlySOphMuo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big feature shown off in the Split Fiction video are Side Stories, optional one-off adventures that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Discovering one and exploring it will transport players to even more worlds influenced by sci-fi and fantasy fiction, with some of the levels including outer space, an Alice in Wonderland-themed world, and a stage that looks heavily influenced by the recent Dune movies.</p><p>Developed by the studio behind the critically acclaimed It Takes Two, Split Fiction was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-only-split-fiction-is-an-impressive-leap-forward-from-the-makers-of-it-takes-two/1100-6528426/">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a>. A mandatory two-player game, Split Fiction lets you play as two would-be writers: Mio and Zoe. After the pair sign up to participate in a new publishing program, they find themselves transported to virtual recreations of their stories by a shady tech company and have to work together to escape before they lose their memories.</p><p>Split Fiction is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on March 6, 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorders-for-it-takes-two-developers-new-game-split-fiction-now-live/1100-6528489/">and preorders are now live for it</a>. The great thing about the game is that it comes with a cross-play Friend Pass, allowing one user to invite a friend to join them even if they haven't purchased Split Fiction.</p><p>Thanks to its cross-play design, it also doesn't matter which of the three applicable platforms your pal is on either, as you'll both be able to team up for a jaunt across futuristic and magical lands. 2025 has quite a few exciting co-op games on the horizon, and if you're interested in seeing what else is coming out in this genre throughout the year, you can check out GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-most-anticipated-co-op-games-of-2025-and-beyond/2900-6144/" data-ref-id="2900-6144">most-anticipated co-op games of the year</a>.</p>

                <p>Sega recently filed trademarks for Skies of Arcadia and Eternal Arcadia, leaving fans hopeful that some sort of remaster or new entry in the Skies of Arcadia RPG series.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sega-trademarks-skies-of-arcadia-eternal-arcadia-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the two trademarks were filed on January 16 and made public on January 24. Skies of Arcadia, known as Eternal Arcadia in Japan, was a critically acclaimed RPG from Sega that launched in 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was later ported over to the Nintendo GameCube in 2002 as Skies of Arcadia Legends.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skies-of-arcadia/" data-ref-id="5000-891">Skies of Arcadia</a> follows Vyse, Aika, and Fina, who are part of a group of air pirates called the Blue Rogues as they resist against the tyrannical Valuan Empire. Additional ports of Skies of Arcadia have been highly requested by fans throughout the years, although Skies of Arcadia Legends has never been released outside of the GameCube.</p><p>Sega has not confirmed anything new regarding Skies of Arcadia. However, Sega has been on an initiative to revive some of its old franchises. Back in 2023, Sega <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">announced new entries</a> in the Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage franchises.</p><p>Sega is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-virtua-fighter-gets-unexpected-first-look-but-its-not-gameplay/1100-6528672/" data-ref-id="1100-6528672">new Virtua Fighter game</a>. Hopefully, now some sort of Skies of Arcadia revival won't be a pie in the sky dream after all.</p>

                <p>A modding group has released a mod that brings GTA: Vice City content into the GTA 4 engine, despite efforts from publisher Take-Two Interactive to stop them. This project by Revolution Team, called GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition, ported missions, cutscenes, and the world from Vice City into GTA 4's engine and initially required players to own a copy of GTA 4.</p><p>The development team said its YouTube channel was taken offline by Take-Two. That led to the creation of a new channel that houses a launch trailer for the mod, as well as a decision to rework the mod's requirement. Originally, the mod required GTA 4 to play--something that was done to "show respect to the publisher." Now, that requirement has been dropped, and the mod can be downloaded and played as a standalone game. As always, though, you should be careful about what you download online.</p><p>"Our team's channel was deleted by Take-Two Interactive two days before the project's release. A lot of time and effort was invested into its development, including hundreds of hours of streaming," Revolution Team's statement reads on an updated teaser trailer.</p><p>"[The teaser] gained over 100,000 views in less than a day. Unfortunately, it's absolutely impossible to restore it. We were forced to create a new channel, but it's unlikely that this trailer will reach the people who were truly waiting for it. Nevertheless, we're sharing the result of almost two years of hard work."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hqwmq6XT6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7hqwmq6XT6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Just last week, a mod known as Liberty City Preservation Project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reportedly-kills-another-gta-fan-project/1100-6528845/" data-ref-id="1100-6528845">was taken down after Rockstar contacted its creators</a>.

<p>"Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners' trust and support on this journey," said PCF's CEO, Sebastian Wojciechowski.</p><p>"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it's a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," Coalition studio head Mike Crump added.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and Brothers developer Hazelight has given us a fresh peek at the studio's next co-op game, Split Fiction, including a look at its Side Stories.</p>
<p>First revealed during the The Game Awards last year, today's trailer now pops some off its focus on these "optional one-off adventures", which are nestled within the different levels of Split Fiction's main story.</p>
<p>This optional content is accessed via portals which Mio and Zoe can hop through, and includes moments where you can surf through a desert on the back of a giant sandfish or water ski behind a train. You know, as you do. In the words of studio founder Josef Fares, "this is side content you don't want to miss". You can check out the latest Split Fiction trailer below.</p>

<p>"Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories">Hazelight furthered in a blog post</a>. "These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations.</p><p>
"As these stories have been deeply influenced by our authors' pasts, they will experience long since forgotten ideas and secrets about themselves. Once a Side Story has been completed, our characters return back through the portal to the main level where they first entered the encounter, filled with even greater determination to escape from Rader’s machine with their memories and stories intact… so, going back to our original question, are you up to the challenge?"</p>

<p>Split Fiction was first teased by Hazelight in 2024, with a mysterious image showing a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes. Josef Fares then teased the game was "a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N", which as we all now know is Split Fiction (alas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">not Sexy Bassoon</a>).</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to arrive on 6th March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/self-proclaimed-cocky-man-josef-fares-debuts-all-new-coop-adventure-split-fiction-with-kick-ass-dragons-and-more">across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox's current multiplatform strategy doesn't seem likely to change anytime soon. On the contrary, judging from what Xbox's head Phil Spencer said in a recent interview, we will see even more<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/"> Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles</a> in the future.</p>
<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL">Destin</a>, Phil Spencer commented on the possibility of all Xbox Games getting released on PlayStation consoles in the future, saying that we are going to see more games shipping on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles in the future, and that there are no Xbox games that will not be released on other platforms, as they are finding that games releasing on multiple platforms is making Xbox stronger, allowing them to do shows like last week's showcase, and to invest in hardware. This strategy, Spencer continued, enables Xbox to do more on platform and hardware, and it's a system that works for them, as they are seeing quick growth in certain markets, such as in Asia, where there's been an increase in players and playing hours on cloud. Ultimately, when asked about the possibility of Starfield launching on PlayStation 5, Phil Spencer said keeping games off other platforms is not Xbox's strategy, so it seems like there are truly no red lines when it comes to porting former Xbox exclusives to other systems.</p>
<p>During the interview, where Phil Spencer briefly also touched upon the Xbox handheld, saying that they are focusing not only on the hardware side of things but also on the software side and the user experience, the Xbox head commented on the Xbox Series S and the parity clause that some developers have difficulty working around with, saying that, contrary to what most believe, the system has given Microsoft an advantage in the current market that is seeing the rise of handheld PCs and the future release of the Nintendo Switch 2. As developers are building their games on devices with different hardware capabilities, Microsoft's teams have the advantage as they have been targeting the Xbox Series S for a while. Additionally, Spencer highlighted how current game engines have great scalability, so it definitely sounds like there's no reason to do away with the Xbox Series S parity clause.</p>

<p>While some may not have been excited by Microsoft's new strategy, some in the industry feel like it will also be the way to go for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony,</a> such as&nbsp;Moon Studios' CEO Thomas Mahler, who recently said that he would be surprised if the Japanese company didn't follow suit in the future for a few reasons, including a stagnating console market.</p>
