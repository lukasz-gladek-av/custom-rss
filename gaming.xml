            <p>From next week, anyone who pre-ordered their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> Premium Edition via the PlayStation Store will be refunded.</p>
<p>Community developer DebbieElla told players the refunds were coming as part of recent "adjustments", and confirmed we'll get "all the details" on the changes on 17th September.</p>

<p>As we reported last week, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 publisher Paradox is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/good-the-grubby-paid-clan-plan-for-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-being-adjusted">rethinking its plan to charge for two of the six playable clans in the game</a> following community feedback. The news came after publisher Paradox announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">the release date for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, 21st October, along with pricing details for the game. It was then we learned the company intended to charge £20 extra to access two clans in the game, via a Shadows and Silk content pack.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">According to developer, The Chinese Room</a>, these two clans represented content developed beyond what was originally planned for the game after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">inherited development of Bloodlines 2 </a>from Hardsuit Labs. Consequently, The Chinese Room's reasoning was this was additional content developed for the game, so it would sell it as such at release. But not anymore.</p>
<p>Now, in a Discord post, DebbieElla writes: "We are working hard on the adjustments that we promised, and we will be able to tell you all the details on 17th September. Making significant changes like this involves many moving parts, and we want to make sure that we get it right with this change.</p>
<p>"Anyone who pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store will be contacted and refunded starting Monday 8th September. You'll be able to pre-order your Premium Edition copy later again, before the release on 21st October. Please note that this is an intentional first step in our planned course of action leading up to 17th September to deliver the best possible experience for you at launch."</p>
<p>The post closed on thanking players for their patience, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/ncm9z9o/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later messages from DebbieElla</a> confirm this only applies to this particular edition sold for PlayStation – purchases on other platforms are unaffected.</p>
<p>Some are now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1n9bbhr/comment/nclwom0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">hoping</a> this signifies all clans may be available in the base game, but as one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1n9bf6u/comment/ncoly53/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">points</a> out, however, "taking the clans out of the deluxe editions is the easy part. The hard part is trying to figure out what else they can put in there".</p><p>In his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 preview</a> a few weeks back, Bertie wrote: "[T]his is a sequel to a cult RPG after all, and one based on a major tabletop RPG to boot. In this case it feels valid to crave a little more role-playing, a little more texture and depth to the game's people and conversations. And so for now, a question mark remains".</p>

		<p>Even though the game’s long development had morphed into something of a meme, I don’t think anyone was truly prepared for just how big the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong would be this week. Truly, it was close to being the GTA of indie game releases, with other indie developers doing what they could to avoid launching on the same day – of course, anything with a physical launch couldn’t really do that – and then all of the digital storefront feeling the crunch and stumbling as everyone rushed to download.</p>
<p>All of which is to say…. are you playing Silksong this weekend?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Andrewww</b> continues to seemingly only ever play games that are just about to leave PlayStation Plus, giving Dead Island 2 and Night in the Woods a try. Alas, neither of them grabbed his attention, but the Alone in the Dark remake managed to survive past the opening few hours. He also continued his journey through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but now he’s got stick drift in one of his controllers so it trying for a warranty replacement. Good luck with that!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week, enjoy the improved weather for the weekend, and we’ll catch you back here on Monday!</p>

<figure><a title="WAYP SILKSONG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1aae10e995fdd/wayp-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Aloha, amigos, and welcome shorts fans, to another weekend. It's been a very, very quiet one this week, with no games of note to menti...oh, hold on. Wait. We've actually been inundated with bangers. I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally materialised. It's a real game that you can play right now! In fact, it's so real that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-switch-eshop-and-steam-are-buckling-under-the-weight-of-silksong">crashed a bunch of online stores when it dropped</a>, causing both the eShop and Steam to struggle for a prolonged period.</p>
<p>We've also had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, an adventure that had us all worried during the week with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-force-isnt-strong-with-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-initial-impressions-suggest">rumoured poor performance on Switch 2</a>, arriving in splendid form. Utinni indeed, small furry warrior. Of course, game-key cards have also been front and centre in the wake of Outlaws' release; folk continue to rally against them, although explanations for why they are used in this case <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">are showing up</a> to muddy the argument waters even further.</p>
<p>Away from the heady heights of those two games, which we're sure most folk will spend this weekend diving into, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> has also just gone live. We'll have a review of that one ASAP - but early impressions do seem to point to, well, the early impressions from the internet are 60fps and/or under 30fps depending where you read 'em, so stick with us and we'll know for sure very shortly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, with Atari's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> also on this week's ticket, there's certainly a decent spread of games to be getting on with playing, whether you're into walking around knocking wee balls into holes on nicely mowed lawns, or CQC'ing stormtroopers just because you can.</p>
<p>So, without any further interruption, let's have a look at what some of the Nintendo Life team are playing this weekend. Namaste.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187446,187479 @ 1757156464 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I've been having a space-whale of a time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> this week, and I'm very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, which I've managed a few hours on already. However, my weekend is gonna be mostly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>, which I've already been playing through early access on PS5, so I'm very interested to see how it shapes up on Switch 2. Expect a review of that shortly!</p>
<p>Otherwise, yeah, it's gonna be me and my two absolutely enthralled sons (who somehow seem to know all the Hollow Knight lore, despite having not played it), sat in front of a TV for Team Cherry's latest. Not a bad plan.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I will be mostly playing the things I was playing last week. Namely, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and a bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a>. I just finished up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> (look out for a review soon), so it's back to Hallownest for the most part.</p>
<p>And given the positive reaction to the Switch port, I'm also keen to check out the other recent Star **** game, Outlaws. We'll see if I can squeeze that in too.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since the game is out now, I don’t mind telling you that I’ll be playing a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> this weekend in an effort to get a review ready as soon as possible. I won’t go into too much detail now, but I’m enjoying it so far – it’s cool.</p>
<p>And of course I’m playing Silksong! I got really caught up in the hype on launch day and I’m glad I did. It’s really quite good. I get lost quite a bit and there’s one mini-boss that’s giving me a real headache, but I shall persevere.</p>
<h2>Damien McFerran, Editorial Director</h2>
<p>Having successfully avoided it for almost a decade, I'm actually getting around to playing the original Hollow Knight this week. I reasoned that, in 2025, resistance was useless; if I want to be part of the Silksong conversation, I need to play the first game before I can dip into the sequel, right?</p>
<p>So far, I'm loving it – in fact, I'm now at the point where I can't believe I sat on this game for so long. The music! The visuals! The dialogue! The challenge! It's like two of my favourite games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-its-about-time-castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-came-to-switch">SotN</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, had a baby and left it on my doorstep, and I cruelly left said baby on said doorstep for ages before finally bringing it in from the cold. Forgive me, Team Cherry!</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>Hornet has bound me to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for eternity. Well, it could be much, much worse... Fortunately, she is letting me go out and celebrate my partner's birthday with family this weekend, so that's good.</p>
<p>Check back for my review soon!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-wants-new-dd-mmorpg/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-wizards-of-the-coast-head-want-to-see-a-new-d-d-mmorpg-happening.1290513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following last year's celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D henceforth), Wizards of the Coast has slowly unveiled a bold plan in the gaming space. This coincided with a new president, John Hight, who joined the RPG, board game, and collectible card games publisher after being the 'Chief Caretaker' for World of Warcraft at Blizzard for ten years. </p>



<p>Therefore, it is perhaps not that much of a surprise to hear him speak about his desire to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG. In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wizards-of-the-coast-president-would-love-a-new-dungeons-dragons-mmorpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he openly admitted that he'd like to see that happen, although such a project would likely have to deviate from World of Warcraft's two-decade-old formula.</p>



<p><em>I'd love to have that. I think that we'll want to rethink what an MMO is in this day and age. I think the traditional model that Blizzard – well, even before that, Ultima Online, Everquest – pursued, that could use updating. I think in our case, it's probably a crawl, walk, run situation. We want to make sure that we've assembled the talent, we have the backend technology, we have the plans to pursue. But of course, that's a glimmer in my eye. I want to see that happen.</em></p>



<p>D&amp;D and MMORPGs are two of my favorite things in the entertainment space, so I would be lying if I didn't say how excited I am about the prospect. There are already two MMORPGs based on Wizards' IP (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, originally released by Turbine in 2006 and now maintained by Standing Stone Games, and Neverwinter, launched by Cryptic in 2013), but they are pretty old by this point and never really got anywhere as big as the franchise deserves.</p>



<p>Still, this is not a game announcement. Hight's statement clarifies that Wizards of the Coast wants to build a tech and talent base before even attempting such a gargantuan task. Then, once the project actually gets the green light, it may take the better part of a decade before it's done, so better sit tight.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can at least look forward to many other D&amp;D games, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The fantasy tabletop adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out later this year.</li>



<li>Project Baxter,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an online cooperative game in development at Starbreeze</a>&nbsp;(the makers of Payday) and scheduled to launch in 2026.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen. Asmussen knew Hight from their time at Sony, before Hight's move to Blizzard, which made the partnership easier.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, the Wizards of the Coast president also announced hiring a group of former Monolith and Cliffhanger Games developers led by Michael de Plater. That announcement only mentioned this team would incubate a 'cool new game concept' without clarifying whether it would be set in the D&amp;D IP or something new. Wizards isn't putting all its gaming eggs in the same basket, either: they've also funded <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a>, the Mass Effect-like RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe title in the works at Atomic Arcade.</p>

<p>Free and paid DLC is on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> launched for the Switch 2 earlier this week, and now that the game is available, the team has gone into detail about the post-launch content on the way.</p>
<p>This includes a free roadmap update, which will add content from October through to December, along with some paid content. The free DLC starts on 2nd October 2025 with a new boss and cosmetic item. This will be followed by another two new bosses and cosmetic items in the same month, and later in December, three more new bosses will be added.</p>
<p>The paid "Into the Abyss" Expansion Pack is also scheduled to be released at some point in November.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9edff6b020ef1/daemon-x-machina.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In our review we said this game was a decent mech experience, even if it was a bit clunky in some parts. A Switch 2 demo is also available to download on the eShop, if you want to try the first nine chapters of the game and freely explore the open world. Multiplayer support is also included and save data will carry over to the full release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">To heck with this guy in particular.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're merrily strolling your way through Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, not a care in the world, you may want to brace yourself. Because aside from Silksong's usual slate of super-tough bosses that'll have you corpse running over and over again, there's one very early miniboss enemy that's causing a lot of players a whole heap of trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Very minor spoilers for an early-game miniboss in The Marrow appear below. Don't read on if you don't want to know anything about any of the game's enemies.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The miniboss in question is considered so minor by the game that it doesn't appear with a name on-screen, making it tough to Google a guide when you get stuck on him. But his name is Skarrgard, and he's a bulky red bug enemy wielding a big piece of bone as a weapon. You can find him waiting in a cave on the east side of The Marrow, just above the prison.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skarrgard seems inocuous when you first approach him, just like a slightly tougher regular enemy. But this guy really has some folks on tilt. He's got three attacks: one where he disappears underground and pops up for an attack, a jump attack, and one where he swings his bone around. He's got some real range on that bone weapon, and because the tunnel is so tiny, most of his moves are very hard, if not impossible, to jump over. What's more, his attacks hit for <em>two whole masks of damage</em> rather than just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two ways to beat Skarrgard, the easy way and the hard way. The hard way is to keep practicing and eventually defeat him (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/How_to_Defeat_the_Skull_Ant_Miniboss_Early">see our red axe ant mini boss thing strategy guide for exactly how to do beat him early</a>). You can lure him down the narrow tunnel a bit so he can't do his jump attack more, and if you run past him whenever he goes underground, you can sort of bounce him back and forth in the center of the room, taking careful swings, and eventually bring him down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I recommend the easy way, which is to come back later. You'll eventually get a dash ability that makes it <em>much</em> easier to avoid his hits, and it seems like you're meant to have that ability before challenging Skarrgard for real. Even if you're tempted by a juicy reward for killing him early, maybe don't bother? The reward for fighting him is that it unlocks access to a new area, and if you're fighting him early you probably have plenty else to explore that isn't hidden behind a giant, bone-swinging bug man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, good luck with this guy. For many, he's significantly tougher than any of Silksong's early actual bosses, so don't feel discouraged if you die to him a lot before you finally score a win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Infinity Plus One developed the remaster, which will include the Revenge of the Plague Lord and Challenge of the Warlords expansions.</p><p>The Immortal Edition will arrive with improved gameplay, 4K artwork, over 40 new items, and an exclusive player character class. It's also going to feature the Attack of the Golem Lord expansion that was created for The Legend Continues.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/puzzle-quest-the-legend-returns-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's eShop listing</a>, Puzzle Quest: The Legend Returns will remain up until September 19. Players who already purchased the game will still be able to play it, but there will be no further updates. The Legend Returns owners will also be offered an exclusive discount for Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition. However, pricing details for the new incarnation of the game have yet to be officially disclosed.</p>

In addition to touching on the early days of the company behind Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, Hines spoke about what he feels the future of services like Game Pass looks like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He admits his retirement from the Microsoft-owned Bethesda means his view on the matter may not be up to date. However, Hines says he witnessed what he “considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago” that now appears to be “bearing out the way I said.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore,” Hines said. “When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack s*** – then you have a real problem.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have discussed the viability of platforms like Game Pass since its launch in 2017. While a service flooded with hundreds of games for subscribers to play sounds like a dream come true for players, how the developers behind these games receive support has been hazy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Game Pass <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-history-subscription-service"><u>pushed forward into the early 2020s</u></a> and PlayStation eventually established its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-ps-now-spartacus-subscription-tiers-price-ps3-xbox-game-pass-release-date"><u>PlayStation Plus-centered competitor</u></a>, more question marks popped up. Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden is one of many who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-style-subscriptions-bad-for-the-business-and-turn-developers-into-wage-slaves-former-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says"><u>recently critiqued the gaming subscription service model</u></a>, calling the “’Netflix of gaming’ idea” a “danger” that has him questioning, “…is it healthy for the developer?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-revenue-was-nearly-5-billion-for-the-first-time-over-the-last-year"><u>Game Pass achieved $5 billion in revenue over the last year this past July</u></a> after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>laying off hundreds of workers across its gaming branch earlier that same month</u></a>. Today, Hines adds that the pressure of an ongoing gaming subscription service is affecting the very developers it needs to exist in the first place. It’s a reliance on this model that he feels is “hurting a lot of people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product,” he elaborated. “That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two Bethesda studios – Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks – were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>shut down in May 2024</u></a>, though the latter was eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down"><u>saved after PUBG publisher Krafton acquired it from Xbox</u></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-consuming-event-releases-like-silksong-are-growing-fewer-and-further-between.1290372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s here. It’s real. It <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-crashed-steam-the-nanosecond-it-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly broke Steam</a>. If you even casually follow video game news, you already know I’m talking about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. The bug-tastic metroidvania has captured the public’s imagination like few indies before it, displacing everything except <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <em>Dota 2</em> on Steam’s list of most-played games. It is a phenomenon, and in that regard, singular by modern standards. But while they didn’t always post these kinds of numbers, Event Releases like this used to be more common. What happened? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss <em>Silksong</em>’s long shadow.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Polygon writers</a> Ryan Gilliam and Cass Marshall, who just launched a new worker-owned video game website, <a href="https://www.rogue.site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue</a>. It’s like Aftermath, but Polygonier. We ask them how the project came together, how things are going so far, and what their pie-in-the-sky goals are for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, after extolling the virtues of structures that don’t force us to always heap attention on the big game of the week, we heap attention on the big game of the week: <em>Silksong</em>. It’s finally out, and as expected, it’s more <em>Hollow Knight</em>! In other words, it’s good, but also very reminiscent of the first game in structure and feel. This puts it somewhat at odds with other Event Releases like <em>Elden Ring</em>, which garnered similar attention to curious non-fans at launch, but managed to offer them something legitimately new compared to <em>Dark Souls</em>. Will the un-Knighted masses bounce off this one, or will they find something to love despite a lack of attachment to the original? And as the video game industry continues to fragment, how many more all-consuming launches like this do we have in us? Finally, we invent a cool uncle who plays <em>Warframe </em>(Warfruncle).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can join forces with Rogue and Rascal and create a monolithic organization with a catchy name – something like… The Gamer Network. Yeah, that sounds good.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>As I’ve been playing <em>Silksong </em>and kind of feeling like “Yeah, OK, more <em>Hollow Knight</em>,” I’ve been thinking about how there will be tourists, essentially – people who want to see what all the fuss is about. And I think when that happened with <em>Elden Ring</em>, because it was a pretty substantially different offering from a <em>Dark Souls</em> game – at least in terms of openness and your ability to tackle things as you want to and fight a miniboss over here if you start to hit a wall in one area – [newcomers were able to find points of entry and understand the appeal].&nbsp;</p><p><em>Silksong</em>, on the other hand, doesn’t feel that different from <em>Hollow Knight</em>. If you had problems with the original structurally, or if you’re someone who’s not predisposed to enjoying this kind of game, I’m not sure you will enjoy this one either. I think those tourists might have a different experience of this than they would something like <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But the difference between <em>Elden Ring</em> opening up relative to the <em>Souls </em>games is, <em>Hollow Knight</em> wasn’t an ask. It’s not a particularly complicated game in terms of what it’s asking the player. Part of its appeal is that it was accessible. I guess what I mean to say is: We had more cultural moments in gaming pre-2020 and even before then where it was like “We all agree that this is an important game that we are all playing.” There was more of a consensus reality in a way that has been harder to recapture as the industry has collapsed.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it comes up in these little spurts; <em>Helldivers </em>was a pretty good example, and it also benefited from being a cheaper game. <em>Clair Obscur </em>was another, and it also benefited from being a less expensive game. It’s the FOMO thing of gaming, and that’s been harder to get as time has gone on – and as the industry has become wildly unstable for the people who work in it. I think it’s the thing people want to talk about when they talk about triple-A games: this inescapable vortex of spectacle that everybody has to play if they want to be literate. Not that you have to in [<em>Silksong</em>’s case], but this feels like it’s capturing–</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This feels like A Moment.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It feels like a moment! And we don’t have a lot of big moments like that. Everyone is in their little corner, everyone has their little niche, everyone has their thing they’re doing. It’s hard to capture a big game title like that.</p><p><strong>Cass:</strong> I feel like there’s just going to be [fewer and fewer of these as time goes on]. <em>Silksong </em>and then <em>GTA VI</em> coming up are the two big launches that almost feel like the end of the big launch. There are so many games coming out all the time, and so many games are re-launching themselves or doing 2.0s, new seasons, or whatever; it’s getting to the point where, once you get past these landmarks, what could possibly be bigger?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Maybe <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? But yeah, these things are becoming less and less frequent to the point where they will eventually probably just become extinct. All the games we just mentioned have years and years of history behind them in terms of anticipation and mystique.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I would disagree a little on <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Because <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> had this history, but I don’t know many people who loved it that actually cared about the history. There’s an entire group of people who are new to that game [in the series]. That’s what made that such a weird hit. You could say it was the early access [period], you could say all that, but–</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I know what it was. It was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3s-bear-sex-scene-was-such-an-upward-turn-in-momentum-for-the-game-that-its-animator-called-his-mum-to-show-it-off-she-was-like-thats-weeeird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the bear sex clip</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It was the bear sex!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There are Google analytics that show this. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was a curiosity, and then that one clip hit, and suddenly tons of people were searching it. After that it was just an upward trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And so what we gotta do – game developers, listen here – if you want your game to be successful, you just have to have sex with something. Doesn’t have to be a bear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>But probably not a person. There are enough games with sex with those in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>Everything needs some sort of attachment to it. Because in addition to the bear sex – which was very important – <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> was a moment not just because it was some big game everyone was talking about, but because it felt like the height of <em>Critical Role</em>, the revitalization of<em> D&amp;D</em>, and this giant video game coming together in a way where everyone could experience it. At Polygon, we had people who were on the entertainment team or something – who didn’t play a ton of games every year – but could in their offtime get into it because of <em>D&amp;D</em>. Everything needs something like that. It’s hard to imagine games that are just big video games [in a vacuum] like <em>GTA VI</em> continuing forward.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two"><h3>Seven Months After Civ VII’s Launch, Firaxis Workers Are Being Laid Off</h3></a><p>2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, whatever that means</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-26-fm26-sports-interactive-womens-league-wsl-nwsl"><h3>More Sports Games Should Take A Year Off</h3></a><p>It gives you the time to, for example, add around 35,000 new players to a game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

            <title><![CDATA[Rematch Finally Supports Crossplay Nearly Three Months After Launch With Third Major Patch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rematch-crossplay-support-live-patch-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rematch-finally-supports-crossplay-nearly-three-months-after-launch-with-third-major-patch.1290363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch, the five, four, and three-a-side arcade football game from Sifu developer Sloclap just got its third major patch today, and it's the most significant patch for the game so far, since it's the one that finally pushes crossplay support live across all platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-3-1-200-300">Patch #3</a> technically first premiered on August 29, because Sloclap hosted a beta test for it for Steam players only, but as of today, September 5, it's been pushed live to all platforms, with crossplay support being its headlining feature, alongside a few major gameplay tweaks, like lowering the maximum speed at which players can lock onto volley targets while using Extra Effort by 10%.</p>



<p>Sloclap also reduced the power boost from aerial extra volley shots, two key gameplay elements that are a direct response to the current gameplay meta.</p>



<p>This patch also introduced tap direction for mouse and keyboard players, and of course, a whole bunch of bug fixes.</p>



<p>It's nice to finally see crossplay support go live, since it was a feature players expected the game to have at launch, only to feel rug-pulled by Sloclap, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">confirmed hours before the game went live that crossplay functionality wasn't ready</a>. It needed more time to get it working, and then when the game launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-update-patch-1-notes-sloclap/">a slew of other bugs that had to be squashed appeared</a>, as they usually do at game launches.</p>



<p>None of this stopped Rematch from having a massive launch, hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">1 million players in its first 24 hours</a>, and reaching <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-surpasses-5-million-players-since-launch-crossplay-support-still-6-9-weeks-away/">5 million players in its first month.</a> A lot of that is thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-warcraft-remastered-little-nightmares-2-and-more-xbox-game-pass-this-month/">Xbox Game Pass</a>, but that is an undeniably large amount of players to amass for any independent developer.</p>



<p>Now that crossplay support is here, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow, and how Sloclap responds to its evolving meta.</p>



<p>When I checked out Rematch for Wccftech, in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">review</a>, I noted it as "<em>an incredibly solid arcade football game, that is able to capture that feeling of getting a bunch of friends together and kicking a ball around at the local park.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another month means another batch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-gaming-free-pc-steam-games-january-2025-1851736481">“free” Amazon Prime games.</a> This time around, Amazon is giving away what I (and many others) consider to be one of the best PC games ever made: <em>Civilization 4.</em> Beyond that, you can currently grab the also-excellent<em> Into The Breach</em> for nothing and over the next week weeks, even more games will be available for Amazon Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">If you hop over to Amazon Prime Gaming</a> and are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can snag PC copies of <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition,</em> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series</em>, and<em> Into the Breach.</em> Then, throughout the rest of September, Amazon will add more free games, including <em>Spelljammer, Pixel Cafe, and Tower of Time.</em> Even better, <em>Civ4</em>, <em>Spelljammer</em>, and other PC games given away this month are delivered via GOG codes, which means once you claim them, you own them completely with no DRM. Now ain’t that nifty!</p> <p>I personally think that <em>Civilization 4</em> is the pinnacle of the series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-rank-the-civilization-games-worst-to-best-1842571299/6">even if former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett prefers <em>Civ5</em> over it</a>. Yeah, some bits of it are a little tedious and annoying, but the vibes are immaculate, and most of it still holds up perfectly today. Plus, it will run easily on any modern PC. If you were let down by <em>Civ6</em> or <em>Civ7</em>, check out <em>Civilization 4</em>. Just set aside like 9 hours of your day first, as it will consume them in a flash.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games, as well as when they will be available for free on Amazon Prime and which storefronts they use. Oh, and keep in mind these are all PC games; sorry, console-only players.</p> <h3>Now available</h3> <ul> <li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series (GOG Code)</li> <li>Into The Breach (Epic Games Store)</li> <li>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 11</h3> <ul> <li>Afterimage (Amazon Games App)</li> <li>Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace (GOG Code)</li> <li>Tower of Time (GOG Code)</li> <li>Subterrain: Mines of Titan [(Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <h3>September 18</h3> <ul> <li>Residual (GOG Code)</li> <li>Fate: The Cursed King (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 25</h3> <ul> <li>Mystical Riddles: Ghostly Park Collector’s Edition (Legacy Games Code)</li> <li>Pixel Cafe (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p>Also, some games added in previous months are still floating around on Amazon Prime Gaming’s site, so if you haven’t grabbed those freebies yet and you’re a Prime subscriber, you should check out everything on the site. You may find a few hidden gems still waiting to be played.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Some kinds of games...are going to get priced out of existence."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hollow Knight: Silksong out now, many players are celebrating its unexpectedly low $20 price tag. But some independent developers are pointing out that great as this may be, it could lead to unreasonable expectations for other indie games that can't afford to sell for that low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a number of threads on social media from developers of games such as Unbeatable, Dorfromantik, and others. In one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rj.dcellgames.com/post/3lxlbk2ldkc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky thread</a>, Unbeatable director RJ Lake says that Silksong should cost $40, "and I'm not even joking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Lake isn't upset at Team Cherry for charging $20 - that's their perogative. But it will have an impact on gaming audiences. As Lake explains:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"millions of people will probably buy silksong on day one, and it was a game that had a very 'low' budget, because the budget is 'these devs worked on it without direct pay for however long they wanted to do that,'" Lake writes. "it had a 'these devs are independently wealthy' budget of 'effectively zero dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"they can price however low they want, as a result. their return on investment is infinite no matter what they do. but by charging such a low amount, they are causing lizard brain signals to fire off saying 'this kind of game is worth twenty dollars. you should expect this game for twenty dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"if enough of those lizard brain signals fire, some kinds of games with actual budgets to pay people who need to live are going to get priced out of existence unless they can get the kind of organic groundswell you can't plan for"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of other indie devs think Lake might have a point here, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivanlesan.bsky.social/post/3lxr3siklds2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folks from Deck 13</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsquirreltim.bsky.social/post/3lxm4n7ajgk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Squirrel Games</a>. Over on Twitter/X, Basti Games, the developer of Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores, asked the audience how much Lone Fungus should cost given Silksong's $20 price. Basti had originally been planning on making Lone Fungus $20, too. But because it's shorter in length than Silksong, should it be cheaper?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As a dev making a smaller Metroidvania than Silksong, which I originally though would be fairly priced at 20 USD... what should I price it now?</p><p>It'll be a 10-15+ hours game, but it was made by one person with limited dev time and funds, I can't afford to give it away for free. <a href="https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z</a></p></div>— Lone Fungus (@BastiArtGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately for Basti, the replies overwhelmingly encourage them to price it at $20 if that's what's required. "Dude charge 20$," wrote one fan. "Price is not about the game is about context. They are able to price 20$ for a bigger game because they steem to receive a million times the cost. You are a small company, dude charge 20$ you deserve thst"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another wrote, "10-20 is totally fair imo. Team cherry could have made silksong 40 and still sold hotcakes, the fact they didn't just means they are cool as fuck. Don't hold yourself to standards of giants, or else you'll have to climb a staircase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, other developers are worried too. In an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer article</a> on the subject, Dorfromantik developer Toukana's co-founder, Zwi Zausch, said that the studio's next game, Star Birds, would have its pricing impacted by Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie game prices has historically been a challenging subject, as teams balance needing to ensure all their members are adequately paid, uncertainty around sales numbers, and the volatility of audiences in deciding not to buy smaller games at prices they perceive as too high. As AAA game prices climb fro $60 to $70 to $80, there has been renewed discussion on where indies should fall - many can't afford to go lower than $20, but many will also lose sales if they don't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People have less money now and are buying fewer games," says Mike Rose, founder of No More Robots, "so you have to set yourself up to hopefully be that one game they buy when they do have money. And if you are a higher price, it's now actually a bit offputting."</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-developers-are-worried-silksongs-20-price-tag-will-make-it-harder-to-price-their-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, NCSoft finally unveiled Cinder City, the open-world MMO shooter initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-lll-an-open-world-mmo-shooter-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2022 as Project LLL. The game is set in an alternate future version of Seoul that gets quarantined following an apocalyptic event. At the beginning of the game, nine months have passed, and the roads of the South Korean capital are roamed by 'bizarre lifeforms', making it a hazardous area.</p>



<p>Not so much for the Knights, a group of cybernetically enhanced soldiers that can clear the way for regular fighters. That's exactly the task given to Seven, one of those Knights, in the mission available at the German convention. After a cutscene where Seven theatrically drops out of the sky, Crysis-style, the gameplay begins. It's immediately apparent that Cinder City is a third-person cover-based shooter with much inspiration from Ubisoft Massive's Tom Clancy's The Division. Just like in that game, gear has loot rarity, owing to the MMO-like influences.</p>



<p>At least in this demo, though, enemies don't really feel like bullet sponges. Moreover, the shooting feels very punchy, with clear, booming hit sounds for powerful weapons like sniper rifles that create a satisfactory shooter experience for the player. Seven's exosuit allows him to sprint ahead or dodge to the sides, though that requires stamina. At least in the demo, stamina was consumed perhaps too quickly, though that may well change with gear and skill upgrades. Again, like in The Division, there are several equippable skills, like a personal energy shield and a salvo of missiles. These appear to have consumable charges.</p>



<p>Enemies are no cakewalk, either. This is an online-only PvE cooperative shooter, so you'll generally have the help of other players, although there is a narrative campaign that you could play solo if you want. While that wasn't shown in the demo, the full game will allow players to hijack and pilot mechs, ride and shoot in helicopters, and drive vehicles and command other combat vehicles. </p>



<p>More importantly, the demo was single player only, but as I said, this is an MMO-like shooter for which development studio BigFire Games is preparing a proper endgame and extensive post-launch support. I learned more about those features while speaking to BigFire Games CEO Jaehyun Bae. Cinder City is currently planned for a 2026 launch on PC (where the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray tracing</a>) and consoles.</p>

<p><strong>NCSoft is historically known for its MMOs. To what extent can players expect to find MMO-like features in Cinder City? Will there be an endgame?</strong></p>



<p>If you played the single player demo, it might be slightly misleading in that the campaign is not the primary content of the final product. The major part will be the open world online shooter where hundreds of players can play together simultaneously in the same field in a vast 7x7 kilometers wide city. The primary genre would be large scale MMO shooter.</p>



<p><strong>Ok. Anything to share on the endgame part yet?</strong></p>



<p>As for the endgame, it will revolve around PvE content, like boss fights, as you've glimpsed in the Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live trailer, where tens of players surrounded a gigantic mech boss. A variety of boss fights will be provided as the endgame content. The second element would be instanced dungeons that require a certain number of players to join and matchmake and start. They'll try to strategize to break through instanced dungeons in the underground, subway areas, things like that. Those two, the instanced dungeons and the additional PvE boss fights, would probably be our endgame content for Cinder City players.</p>



<p><strong>Are those instanced dungeons meant to be more challenging than the open world boss fights?</strong></p>



<p>It wouldn't be tiered into different levels of difficulty. It's more about these bosses' differences, patterns, gimmicks, or characteristics. It's not that the instanced dungeon bosses would necessarily be stronger than the open world bosses. </p>



<p>Our aim when building bosses is that you have to strategize and outmaneuver them with tactics and different builds rather than just fire against some stationary bullet sponge bosses, so we are aiming to provide boss fights with a variety of patterns. One of the examples would be the one you just played against in the single player demo, the one with the big hammer. That's what we aim for when creating the bosses for Cinder City.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be traditional MMO-like trinity roles, such as tank, DPS, and support, in your game?</strong></p>



<p>We do have different roles for the characters you get to play as, but it's not like the traditional designated MMO roles, like you mentioned, the tank, healer, and DPS characters. It's rather about specific tactical weapons or skills that they are equipped with. We are trying to diverge from that traditional MMORPG formula, because it could have bound us to those conventional mechanics.</p>



<p>So, it is more about different skills that characters have, which is more in line with other shooter games and the sci-fi setting, too. For example, if an enemy sends a lot of projectiles towards you, you might counter that with a skill that hijacks them and diverts them to protect yourself and your allies, or you might turn on a barrier-like shield dome to safeguard those inside. </p>



<p>There will be a variety of skills of this kind, more in line with the shooter genre. Those skills and of course the gear will determine the character's role, rather than just giving them a predetermined role like DPS, tank, or healer</p>



<p><strong>Will there be skill trees to specialize your character in various areas?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, there will be skill trees. In the Gamescom 2025 demo, you could play as one character, but we are preparing several playable characters for Cinder City. Skills are considered to be tactical gear, and there is shared tactical gear that all characters can utilize, while some tactical gear is exclusive to specific characters. That way, players can kind of develop their own skill builds by selecting between those items. </p>



<p><strong>Will there be any beta test events before launch, and if so, will they happen soon?</strong></p>



<p>We have tests lined up internally, but between early next year and sometime in the middle of next year, we are planning to host an open beta for players outside NCSoft to try the game. </p>



<p><strong>Is Cinder City going to be a simultaneous global launch?</strong></p>



<p>Probably. It's not fully determined yet, but that is currently our idea.</p>



<p><strong>Are you planning to adopt a free-to-play or premium business model?</strong></p>



<p>With regards to that, it is still under discussion and hasn't been determined yet.</p>



<p><strong>Since the game also includes a narrative-driven campaign, can you provide an estimate on how long that part of the game will last for the average player?</strong></p>



<p>The story is definitely one of the most important parts of our game. There will be several types of storylines in our game, such as the epic storyline. It's like a golden path or main storyline, and it will probably take between ten and fifteen hours to complete, almost like playing a single player narrative-driven shooter. Then, there will also be a lot of smaller side stories for each character and/or for each region, so combining all of that, I'm assuming it will probably be around a hundred hours to complete all storylines. But I get the feeling that nowadays players prefer not to have a lot of smaller side quests or stories; they'd rather have large scale boss battles, that kind of content, so we are thinking on how to balance between the two.</p>



<p><strong>Since the open world element is very important to Cinder City, will there be any dynamic events to spice up the players' experience?</strong></p>



<p>There will definitely be dynamic events you can encounter while roaming in the open world. They might be triggered when you reach a specific point in the map. There will be a trade-off between side quests, side stories, and those dynamic events. If we populate the world with more dynamic events, we'll have fewer side stories. I think that's the part that we have to find a way to balance.</p>



<p><strong>In terms of post-launch content, what can players look forward to? More dungeons, characters, and dynamic events? That sort of stuff?</strong></p>



<p>We are definitely used to that MMO formula of having regular content updates. For our game, we will definitely add new dungeons and new characters. </p>



<p><strong>Speaking of characters, can you share how many will be playable at launch?</strong></p>



<p>There will be seven to nine characters available at launch.</p>



<p><strong>They all have unique skills or perks, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, that's correct. We even have one of the characters who wields a long blade and will use that as their Ultimate skill, distinguishing them from the others.</p>



<p><strong>I assume the character's appearances will be customizable to a degree, correct?</strong></p>



<p>Indeed, yes.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a transmog-like feature in Cinder City where you can modify the look of a certain gear piece while maintaining its stats?</strong></p>



<p>Players nowadays care more about the looks anyway, so yes, there will be. But we don't know yet if it will be available at launch.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lost Haven Games has launched a new Kickstarter campaign. The indie creator's latest project is the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG, a tabletop experience inspired by SNES-era RPGs, set in a lively, optimistic world of distant clouds.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skies Above</em> RPG Kickstarter</h2>

<p>In its campaign page, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG draws heavy inspiration from classic JRPGs, citing icons like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em> alongside the likes of the <em>Grandia</em> and <em>Lunar</em> series. The game's world is set in a post-apocalyptic sky, but eschews the dark and dreary tone. Instead, it presents a world full of vitality, intrigue, and abundance. Its core gameplay centers on exploding d8s.</p>

Skyfolk include the Khoros, bird people that became invaluable in the new world thanks to their ability to fly, and the cat-like Pommo people. The jobs are familiar genre staples like the Monk, Paladin, and Thief, alongside more esoteric choices like the Biomancer and Invoker.</p>

<p>One unique selling point for <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is a crafting and cooking system. Directly referencing the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series and <em>Dungeon Meshi</em>, the game provides rules for turning monster parts into gear and consumables. There are even recipes for various dishes within the monster bestiary. It's a system that helps this game stand out from its peers like <em>Break!!</em> and <em>Fabula Ultima</em>.</p>

<p>This game is the third project by Lost Haven Games. Its founder, Andrew Lever, recently made waves with his last project, the award-nominated TTRPG, <em>Abbadon: The Thirteen Seals</em>. A dark fantasy game, inspired by <em>Diablo</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-inhuman-bondage-release-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>, where character actions are resolved with a standard 54-card deck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Sky Explorer for $21:</strong> A PDF copy of the game and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Adventurer for $54:</strong> A physical, hardcover copy of the game, a PDF, and both physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Legend for $126:</strong>&nbsp; Everything in the Sky Adventurer tier, a custom D8, a cover art print, a custom art card sketch, and a Frog Knight pin.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is sitting at&nbsp;<span><span>$3,397, which is close to half of its initial funding goal of $8.072. The campaign concludes October 2.</span></span></p>
