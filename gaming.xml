		<p>Total Mayhem Games has announced the next entry into the We Were Here series with the reveal of We Were Here Tomorrow. We Were Here Tomorrow is its own standalone entry in the series, and does not have story links to the previous games. It also features two player online co-op so players can work together to explore the mysterious facility they find themselves in.</p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here Tomorrow - Official Announcement Trailer | Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEruovfOaKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for We Were Here Tomorrow says, <em>“In this next standalone entry of the We Were Here series, you and your partner wake up inside a mysterious facility. Strange machinery surrounds you, and a calm, confident voice guides you through a series of assignments. Often separated and equipped with different tools, you’ll need to rely on your walkie-talkies to communicate clearly and work together. Each assignment introduces new asymmetrical puzzles that can only be solved through cooperation with your fellow explorer. As you progress, you’ll slowly uncover why you ended up here and what your role is within the facility. Only by working together can you decide the fate of Tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p>Aside from the two player co-op, We Were Here Tomorrow will also feature asymmetrical puzzles, the two characters having distinct roles and abilities, and a facility that has a retro-future design to it. We previously reviewed the last entry to the series <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/08/we-were-here-forever-review/">We Were Here Forever</a>, and in our review Stefan said, <em>“We Were Here Forever certainly grew on us the more we played, with some great brain-teasing puzzles that really make the most of the split player perspectives (though we did give up on the walkie-talkies).”</em></p>

<p>We Were Here Tomorrow is going to release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with an aim of releasing this year but a concrete date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch server slam went live earlier today. Over 100,000 players immediately flocked to give Bungie’s new extraction shooter a try for free on PC and console. Naturally, they immediately tried to type<em> “</em>Arc Raiders,” the name of the game’s biggest genre rival, into chat. You’ll never guess what happened next.</p> <p>Yes, <em>Marathon</em> censored the game name. Typing <em>Arc Raiders</em> into your squad’s group chat returned “*** *******” instead. One Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lirik/clip/FriendlyEnchantingOpossumRalpherZ-HA7GJI8yzhJd3Uw9">streamer’s clip</a> showing the censorship has already started making the rounds online.</p>  <p><em>Kotaku</em>‘s Zack Zwiezen is currently playing the <em>Marathon</em> beta as well and tested the game’s no–”Arc Raiders” filter a bit further. You can type “arc.” You can type “raiders.” You can type “arcraiders.” You can even type “arc&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;raiders.” But you can cannot type “Arc Raiders.” Weird!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674100"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674100">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even weirder, this isn’t the first time “Arc Raiders” has been censored in an online multiplayer shooter. <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arc-raiders-beta-chat-censor-2000632129">The same thing</a> happened with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> last fall, even though the rogue text filter issue was later patched out. EA was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">reportedly censoring</a> 2025’s hit extraction shooter as well.</p> <p>In <em>Marathon</em>‘s case, the genre rivalry is a bit more straightforward. The game’s success will depend in part on people taking a break from <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ new season to loot robots on Tau Ceti IV instead. <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheating-bans-marathon-exploits-2000673239">Shots were already fired</a> over competing approaches to banning cheaters. So far at least, <em>Marathon</em>‘s free weekend appears to be off to a decent start.</p>

 <p><strong>Update 2/26/2026 4:02 p.m. ET:</strong> The weird bug appears to have been patched out. Arc Raiders love is officially welcome on Tau Ceti again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/mTGwEwSi2h">pic.twitter.com/mTGwEwSi2h</a></p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027121247696699432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093</link>
            <guid>1447720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Over the past 10 years, </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> has risen from indie darling to the most popular farming sim ever made. It’s also apparently been a huge labor of love for its creator, Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone, who keeps returning to release new major updates after claiming he’s done. Now, on the game’s 10th anniversary, Barone is looking both to the future and the past with two big reveals: additions to its romanceable cast, and some pretty neat looks back at its development history.</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, in a video commemorating </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>10th anniversary, Barone revealed two marriage candidates heading to the game’s 1.7 update: Clint and Sandy. Clint is the town’s blacksmith, and he’s almost universally despised (and occasionally even panned as an incel). On the other hand, Sandy, who lives in the game’s desert area and runs the store there, is pretty cool and mysterious!</span></p>

  <p><span>Barone </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>revealed that the game would receive new marriage candidates earlier this month</span></a><span>. Players, of course, spent the whole month speculating who they could be—if they’d be new characters entirely, if the Wizard would finally become romanceable, or if there would be a divorce in town that rendered a married couple eligible. Quite a few people hoped it would be Sandy (although her addition seemed unlikely because she lives so far away), while mostly nobody wanted Clint.</span></p> <p><span>The video is also packed with some pretty charming peeks back at the game’s development timeline, especially from the game’s 2012 iteration called </span><i><span>Sprout Valley</span></i><span>. As far as I’m aware, this is the first time he’s shown off so much of that version. The layout of </span><i><span>Sprout Valley’s</span></i><span> world resembles that of the one we know today pretty closely, but the art is vastly different and (sorry) a lot less cohesive. Barone himself didn’t have too many kind words to say about the game’s earlier version either, calling the pixel art “crap” and speculating on what his life would have been like if he hadn’t put more time into development.</span></p>

 <p><span>“If I had just released this game after 6 months,” he said, “where would I be right now?”</span></p> <p><span>However, the footage he showed off later revealed that the game pretty quickly turned into the </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>we all know and love, with the build he showed off from just one year later looking almost identical to the game as it exists today. That’s just a really, really impressive turnaround for a developer to make. “</span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> hit puberty here,” he joked.</span></p>

 <p><span>Footage of the older builds also revealed a few massive features that were completely scrapped. He let on that the mines were initially procedurally generated and inspired by </span><i><span>Terraria</span></i><span>, and there was also an entire underground goblin village that was axed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was really neat to get a peek at this older gameplay, especially the axed features, the latter of which I’m sure will spawn plenty of theories about the game’s lore. I’m less happy about the marriage candidates, though. As someone who’s married to Emily in the game, I’m absolutely </span><i><span>repulsed </span></i><span>by Clint, who still flirts with Emily constantly despite my farmer literally having two children with her. Maybe it’s good that he can finally find a partner who’s not my freaking wife, I guess? Sandy, on the other hand, is fun! I can definitely see her newfound status as a marriage candidate sparking new challenge runs since players don’t meet her until much later in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Out of everything today, though, I’m most shocked by Barone’s pronunciation of Qi, the last name of an endgame character who provides the game’s most challenging quests. His last name is apparently pronounced “qwee,” which is possibly the worst thing I’ve learned all week. Thanks, Barone.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Factions In Marathon, Explained—How To Unlock New Factions & Increase Their Rank]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/factions-in-marathon-explained-how-to-unlock-new-factions-increase-rank/</link>
            <guid>1447717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest entry into extraction shooters is here, as Marathon has broken onto the scene at long last. As fun as it is to loot and shoot your way through Tau Ceti, some direction is always nice, and for that, you’ll need to familiarise yourself with Factions. </p>



<p>There are six of them to work with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, but you’ll only have access to one of them out of the gates. If you’re looking to make some progress, you’ll want to unlock them all as soon as possible, as they each have unique offerings you’ll want to take advantage of.</p>







<p>Here’s how to unlock each of the six Factions in Marathon, as well as how to increase their Rank. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-factions-in-marathon">What Are Factions In Marathon?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of your contacts. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Factions are essential to your progression whilst playing Marathon, with each one offering you selections of gear to purchase and Contracts to complete in return for a variety of rewards. </strong></p>



<p>As you work your way through Marathon, you’ll quickly realise that Contracts are the biggest source of progression in the game, and there appear to be two varieties of them to complete, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Contracts: Repeatable missions you can complete for the given Faction, which vary in difficulty and rewards</li>



<li>Priority Contracts: One-time missions that are essential to the faction. These are tied to progression and help boost your Faction Rank, as well as offering significant story relevance</li>
</ul>



<p>You can only have one Contract active at a time, and you must select which one you’d like to work on before going out on your next run. That means no multitasking—you’ll have to think about the purpose of every run you go out on. </p>

</ul>



<p>Each Faction offers a unique set of Contracts, but frustratingly, you won’t have access to them all out of the gate. You’ll need to unlock them all if you want to truly progress through Marathon, so here’s how you can get that done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-factions-in-marathon">How To Unlock Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will they unlock? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you want to unlock the other five Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete a special type of contract—the Liaison Contract.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll begin to unlock these pretty early into the game; you’ll just need to complete the tutorial and the Welcome To Tau Ceti Contract. </p>







<p>Once they’re finished, you’ll unlock Liaison Contracts. These are unique Contracts that get you in touch with a new Faction, with each one having its own Liaison to complete. You’ll only have to do these once, as a Faction is unlocked permanently upon Contract completion. </p>



<p>That being said, it’s one thing to unlock the Faction, but you’ll want to rank up with them, too. The higher their Rank, the more useful they’ll be to you, so that should be your next priority.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-factions-in-marathon">How To Rank Up Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What it’s all for. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To rank up Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete Contracts for each of the Factions, with different Contracts offering varying amounts of Rep.</strong></p>



<p>Rep is the currency used to rank up Factions, though it’s utilised automatically. It’s important to rank the Factions up, as the higher the rank they are, the better gear you’ll have access to. Also, at certain milestones, you’ll unlock various reward packages, as well as new Standard Contracts. </p>

</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though, as each Faction has its own selection of Upgrades for you to invest in. These vary drastically between Factions, with some offering improved Vault Space, whilst others offer various permanent Stat upgrades for your Runner. You’ll want to look into these thoroughly, as they’re crucial to building your Runner to suit your playstyle, and you’ll need to know which resources to keep an eye out for on your next run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">a ceremonious reveal at the conclusion of The Game Awards 2026</a>, newcomer developer Wildlight Entertainment launched its first-person raid shooter <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/highguard">Highguard</a> on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Despite eclipsing 100,000 concurrent Steam players around the game's launch, that number quickly dropped (though Steam concurrents are only a fraction of the total players), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/?curator_clanid=42108472&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23519058958&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAqD7is3VDEwxjBfZkCWgcxlH8k8JL&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-__MBhAKEiwASBmsBFUNtoczsPhjLNfWebvZlFh1bim0liiiC0GXfNpU7EGahTTQ39YkYhoCJ2YQAvD_BwE">with Steam's reviews status for the game sitting at "mixed" today</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/update-highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-confirms-layoffs-at-the-studio">Wildlight laid off most of its 100-person staff</a>, roughly two weeks after the game's launch, and according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, less than 20 developers remain at the studio – it's those remaining employees that have pushed out two somewhat hefty <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2027067859239907682?s=20">patches</a> for Highguard since the layoffs on February 11. That same <em>Bloomberg </em>report also details the game's development, the weeks after its reveal at The Game Awards in December, and the subsequent Highguard fallout since launch last month.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that in 2021, a small group of people who worked at developer Respawn Entertainment, owned by EA, quit and started a new studio. After helping Respawn launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> in 2019, some at the studio watched the battle royale bring in more than $3 billion in revenue over the next couple of years. However, some of the creatives felt slighted by how little of that $3 billion made its way to the developers behind it. Thus, the idea of starting a new studio, creating a successful surprise-launch live-service shooter, and sharing the profits among employees was born.&nbsp;</p><p>With Wildlight co-founder and CEO Dusty Welch touting the studio's profit-sharing program, he was able to attract others to join the team and work on what was first a survival game like Rust before it was transformed into the raid shooter that Highguard launched last month, according to the report. <em>Bloomberg </em>writes that after the transition to a raid shooter, which retained some of the elements of the original Rust-esque prototype, testing began with staff, external players, and Tencent's TiMi Studio Group; it was only recently revealed that China-based company Tencent helped fund Highguard by Stephen Totilo's <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"><em>Game File</em></a> on February 17. &nbsp;</p><p>Reception amongst those tests was positive, according to the 10 Highguard developers <em>Bloomberg </em>spoke to for its report, but some employees were apparently concerned that these tests weren't accurate enough to a real play environment. Developers helped playtesters understand mechanics, in-game communication was encouraged, and more, but these gameplay aspects aren't guaranteed when a game reaches players' hands after launch. To get ahead of that, some employees suggested letting people play Highguard before launch, perhaps in a beta or open playtest, but leadership at Wildlight turned down that suggestion, <em>Bloomberg </em>reports.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The leadership at Wildlight wanted to announce the game and launch it a few weeks later, without letting the public play it beforehand, as those developers had seen work successfully with Respawn's Apex Legends. As a result, Highguard was revealed, the reception soured quickly, and the game became a bit of a meme online before it even launched, with some comparing it to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/concord">Concord,</a> PlayStation's own live-service shooter that shut down two weeks after launch.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that the employees it spoke to said Wildlight was a "healthy, collaborative, transparent" environment they loved working in... until the final two months, when morale tanked following the game's subsequent reception after The Game Awards reveal. Then, the game launched on January 26 and did little to impress both critics and players alike – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender"><em>Game Informer </em>gave it a 7.5 in its review</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite a strong initial showing, playercounts dropped, and two weeks after launch, Wildlight laid off most of its staff. With Highguard being a free-to-play title, its avenue for revenue is highly dependent on retaining players and getting them to spend money on in-game cosmetics, mounts, and more. Today, Highguard is still live and receiving updates, though it remains unclear how long it can live with so little staff, comparatively, working on the game.&nbsp;</p><p>For more details, be sure to read the full <em>Bloomberg </em>report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Have you played Highguard?

      <p>Less than two years<a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs/"> <u>after first purchasing the site</u></a> (along with Rock Paper Shotgun, GamesIndustry.biz and VG247) from Reedpop, media company Ziff Davis (owners of IGN) have conducted a number of layoffs at games media site Eurogamer, affecting both editorial and video roles.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/games-media-set-for-more-layoffs-as-ign-owned-eurogamer-cuts-editorial-staff/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>As VGC report</u></a>, "the brand’s most experienced editors and its entire four-person video team" are among those impacted, while "behind-the-camera cuts" have also been made at another Ziff-owned property, the YouTube channel Outside Xbox.

		<p>Liquid Swords has confirmed that its upcoming open world action game &nbsp;Samson: A Tyndalston Story is going to release very soon. In fact, it is only around six weeks away with Samson’s release date confirmed as April 8th. This is for PC only with the game coming to Steam and Epic Games Store, with console versions to come at a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrkHPvMOBwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/samsons-main-story-will-last-around-10-hours-console-versions-confirmed/">previous FAQ</a>, we know that the main story will take around 10 hours to complete, but experiencing everything the game has to offer could take around 25 hours. It will be priced at $24.99 and will be a purely single player experience, so no multiplayer and no microtransactions either. This will be a grounded title so don’t expect too much wackiness, with players having to deal with the consequences of every action they take as Samson. In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt.Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progress, Samson will be able to hone his fighting and driving skills, both of which are crucial to surviving and carrying out the jobs that are offered to him. Samson will have to deal with the criminal underworld of Tyndalston as well as law enforcement, which will become more aggressive if Samson keeps on committing crimes in their presence. The PC minimum specs have also been confirmed for Samson and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OS:</b>&nbsp;Windows 11<wbr></li>
<li><b>Processor:</b>&nbsp;6 cores<wbr></li>
<li><b>Memory:</b>&nbsp;16 GB RAM<wbr></li>
<li><b>Graphics:</b>&nbsp;NVIDIA RTX 20-series or AMD 60-series card<wbr></li>
<li><b>Storage:</b>&nbsp;15 GB free space</li>

<p>Coming in update 1.7</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> turns ten years old today and to celebrate, the game's creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone held <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/stardew-valley-is-celebrating-10-years-with-a-special-anniversary-broadcast">a special broadcast on YouTube</a> looking back at the farming sim's development and update history.</p>
<p>But the big draw was the reveal of two new marriage candidates, who will be eligible for holy matrimony when the 1.7 update releases. And the fresh bachelor and bachelorette will be Clint and Sandy.</p>
<p>Clint is the local Blacksmith of Pelican Town who has a bit of a crush on Emily, who works at the Saloon. For most, he's best known for selling tools and breaking geodes.</p>
<p>Sandy, meanwhile, lives out in the Calico Desert. She runs the Oasis, a store that sells rare seeds and plants which <em>also</em> houses a mysterious room in the back. Not much is known about Sandy right now, so pursuing a romance with her will likely give her some much-needed backstory.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f0175034f617"><a title="Stardew Valley Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f0175034f617/stardew-valley-eric-concernedape-barone.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A">ConcernedApe</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole broadcast, which you can watch up-top, is well worth watching, as it's a lovely look back at the game ConcernedApe has spent <em>so</em> long working on. We see footage of Sprout Valley, which was the game's initial name, all the way through to around six months before its launch on Steam on 26th February 2016.</p>
<p>So, Sandy and Clint will be available to marry when 1.7 launches — when that is, we don't know yet. it will likely come to PC first before hitting Switch and Switch 2, as well, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>ConcernedApe remained hush on the release date and wants to keep many of the update's features a surprise. So don't expect much more news for a minute.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demon Tides Has The Speed And Splendor Of An Old PlayStation Platforming Classic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/demon-tides-steam-review-impressions-platformer-3d-2000674085</link>
            <guid>1447678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to platformers. I grew up on a healthy diet of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>, and pretty much every other mascot run-and-jump game you can name, so I’m real particular about whether a platformer’s movement feels good enough to hold my attention. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>, Fabraz’s sequel to 2021’s </span><i><span>Demon Turf</span></i><span>, feels like a mash-up of so many good platformers that, thanks to all those years I spent running and jumping, make it fit like a glove. The game’s impeccable movement design seems to draw on the best of what multiple games have done, fusing them all at once to make something that feels weighty, yet still fast and fluid enough that movement feels like a joy, not just a means to an end.</span></p> <p><span>I’m only a couple of hours into </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>on Steam (it showed up around the same time as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-leon-grace-capcom-ps5-pc-2000673329"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, I’m sorry!), but the early segments do a great job of introducing you to all the tools the game gives you to get around. Our spunky hero Beebz can transform into different animals at will, allowing her to seamlessly and effortlessly change how she moves through the environment. She can fly, float, grind, swim, and climb, among other things, and the transition between each of these modes of movement is quick, intuitive, and keeps the momentum going as long as your finger’s on the analog stick.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Over the past decade and a half or so, as some games have started to prioritize map size over many other things, traversal has become a common point of friction for me. If moving through a world isn’t quick and painless, I grow to resent giant worlds for wasting my time, thinking about how I would have once been able to accomplish much more in a smaller area rather than having to spend several minutes walking to the good stuff because someone decided that time spent getting somewhere is the pinnacle of game design. If I’m just walking along or riding a horse to get somewhere, my attention drifts pretty quickly, so if you’re going to have a big world, it had better be engaging to move through, and I’d better get where I need to go fast. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>’ open ocean would be daunting and annoying in most games, but transforming into Beebz’s snake form and slithering at incredible speeds makes getting to my next mission and obstacle course a breeze.</span></p> <p><span>Ironically enough, platformers are probably one of the genres best-suited for open-world game design because movement and flow is paramount to these games, even though we typically associate open worlds with grand RPGs or a </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> metropolis. The promise of a large space is only delivered upon if it’s actually fun to explore, and </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span>‘ collage of platforming staples accomplish that by hitting the sweet spot, making sure that your character feels like they have some weight and substance as you push the stick to move but never holding you down. </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>manages to capture the vibe of something retro while giving the modern explorer a big map to sink their teeth into.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I’m still early and have many hours to go, </span><i><span>Demon Tides </span></i><span>scratches an itch I used to satisfy several times a year, but don’t get to as often nowadays. Though 3D platformers aren’t as en vogue as they once were, I still yearn for hopping and skipping through an obstacle course every now and then. </span><i><span>Demon Tides</span></i><span> has all the makings of a game that would have become an early PlayStation classic, and I’m eager to see how much gas it has in the tank as I play on.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Viewer Count Hits New Low As Marathon Starts Running]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-viewer-count-drops-marathon-takes-off/</link>
            <guid>1447675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might have been inevitable, but as Marathon’s server slam has commenced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> has taken a gut punch in terms of viewership. At the time of writing, ARC Raiders boasted <strong>more players </strong>than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> (on Steam, at least), but viewership for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure had hit an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the viewer count was floating at around 22,000 as Marathon got started. That’s the lowest ARC Raiders has been in terms of active, engaged viewers since the game came out in October 2025.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders enjoyed a stunning time in the sun after launching at the end of October. It became regarded as one of the best games of 2025, and in our ARC Raiders review, we dubbed it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" id="155345">most refreshing extraction game</a> ever made.</p>



<p>But almost month after month, the game’s viewer count declines. In December, it dropped -33% compared to November, and in February (this month), -23% from January. Now that a fair chunk of the game’s player base has moved off to see what Marathon has to offer, it’s suffering further, sitting at around 22,500 at the time of writing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s a drop of around 94% since launch, from peak to current.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, Marathon, which comes out in just a week, has managed to trump ARC Raiders in a <strong>major </strong>way, despite only just entering its first open, public test. It has managed to secure a higher peak viewer count than ARC Raiders ever did, notching up a lofty height of 523,301 viewers, which was secured during Marathon’s gameplay reveal in April 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this is being written, Marathon boasts more than ten times the viewership of ARC Raiders, as everyone becomes curious to see what’s happening in Bungie’s new extraction game. The gap between the <strong>player count </strong>(on Steam) was just 30,000 players, too, in ARC Raiders’ favor.</p>



<p>Many believe that Marathon won’t hold a torch to ARC Raiders, which has proven to be overwhelmingly successful since being released in October. It might have some short-term success, but it’s becoming tough for new extraction-based games to <strong>really </strong>succeed in the increasingly saturated market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Can’t I Play Marathon Server Slam Playtest? Currant Error Code, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-cant-i-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-currant-error-code-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans around the world have been patiently waiting for Marathon to arrive, but before it does, Bungie has released the Server Slam Playtest. Although its main goal is to test the server’s stability ahead of Marathon’s full release, the Server Slam Playtest is a great introduction to the game, offering tons of early game content for fans to dive into.</p>







<p>However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be bumps in the road, and some fans have noted difficulties trying to jump into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> action. If you’re one of the struggling few who’ve run into the ‘Currant’ Error Code, here’s what it means and how to fix it.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest-servers-working-right-now">Are The Marathon Server Slam Playtest Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<p>As of February 26, the servers are up and running, as they’re working as intended for the majority of the player base, though it might take you some time to log in. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-runner-shell-in-marathon-all-abilities-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/every-runner-shell-in-marathon-all-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Marathon Runner Shell</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Launch day for any new online title is always bound to present some server instabilities, as the game finds it feet and copes with the sudden surge of players. However, that doesn’t make it any less frustrating if you’re finally ready to play the game, only for the servers to let you down. </p>



<p>Thankfully, it seems that for the most part, the Marathon Server Slam Playtest servers are operational, though some errors are popping up, namely the ‘Currant’ Error Code. If you’ve been unlucky enough to see it, here’s what it means.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re trying to log in to the Marathon Server Slam Playtest and you’re seeing the ‘Currant’ Error Code, that means that there’s an issue with your network connection. </strong></p>



<p>As was the case going into the Server Slam Playtest, Bungie were aware that there’d be teething issues, and some have cropped up already. The ‘Currant’ Error Code appears to be the most commonly seen error, and it’s all to do with your network status. </p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon</a></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Bungie, the first step you should take is to ensure that your current connection is working as intended, so double-check your Wi-Fi and make sure it’s all up to speed. If you’re still seeing the issue, then you’ll want to run through some Network Troubleshooting. </p>



<p>Other users online have reported that a quick fix to the issue is the good old restart, but even that’s not guaranteed to solve the problem. It might just be a case of waiting it out and trying again soon, with the Server Slam expecting high amounts of players—this is likely affecting connectivity issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Stardew Valley turns 10 years old today, marking a huge milestone for one of the most beloved and successful indie games in of the modern era. Despite being far from a live service game, solo developer ConcernedApe (also known as Eric Barone) is still providing content updates to this day, and though they've slowed significantly in recent years, 1.7 is coming soon.</p><p>Today, Barone premiered a video on YouTube celebrating both the anniversary and upcoming update, taking a trip down memory lane to show off old builds of the farming sim while also providing a sneak peek at 1.7 – specifically, Stardew Valley's first new marriage candidates in years. At the very end of the video, he revealed that players will be able to romance Clint, the blacksmith, and Sandy, a shopkeeper in the desert.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geiTg6Z7w3A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geiTg6Z7w3A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Clint is a surprising choice, for a few reasons. For starters, Clint is commonly made fun of by members in the community who dislike his personality. In a cast of beloved characters, he stands out as one of the most commonly disdained. That said, maybe this is Barone's attempt to turn the character's popularity around, since romance quests give characters a lot more depth.</p><p>Still, there are other characters players have requested to romance for years. The most notable are Robin (she's married when the player arrives to the village, but that fact doesn't do much to quell romantic fans) and the Wizard. Unless they're coming in some massive 1.8 update, fans will have to stick to fanfic and mods.</p><p>The rest of the video is worth watching as well, since we don't usually get such a detailed behind-the-scenes look at indie games like this, and it's cool to watch the project come together.</p><p>Stardew Valley's 1.7 update doesn't have release window yet, but will hopefully be out sometime soon. If you haven't played Stardew Valley in a while, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/26/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-out-now-with-mouse-controls-local-split-screen">you can check out its Switch 2 update, which includes split-screen co-op and mouse controls</a>. As for ConcernedApe's next game, Haunted Chocolatier, we have no idea when to expect its release, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">but it's one of our most anticipated games right now</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/26/you-can-marry-clint-and-sandy-in-the-17-update-for-stardew-valley-concernedape-announces]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's pretty safe to say that the video game industry has been in a weird place for several years now, but for <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, who has been at this for a long time, the state of the video game industry is in an unprecedentedly poor place. Founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> and creator of <strong>Just Cause</strong>, Sundberg is getting ready to release his <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/">next major game</a> with his new studio he founded in 2020, <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, which'll release <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> this coming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ahead of Sundberg and Liquid Swords showing off their new title and announcing its release date during today's IGN Fan Fest, I got the chance to attend a presentation about Samson along with a few other members of the press, before spending some time playing the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/">You can check out my impressions on all of that here.</a></p>



<p>Afterwards, I also got the chance to ask Sundberg and Liquid Swords' senior game designer and mission designer for Samson, <strong>Donald Young</strong>, a bunch of questions about the upcoming game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">Within that interview</a>, I also asked a more pointed question about the realities of the modern video game industry, and how Liquid Swords is set up for the long term. That's when Sundberg laid into his thoughts on the current market and how he sees things.</p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been making games for over three decades and&nbsp;<strong>never experienced such a desperate, cowardly (they call it 'risk averse') and confused state of the business</strong></em>," Sundberg said. "<em>After the acquisition / over-investing party during ‘21-’23, we are dealing with the hangover and it’s been going on for three years.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Samson: A Tyndalston Story - Official Release Date Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Kj0VgwD-Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Sundberg continued by explaining how he has personally invested in the foundation of Liquid Swords, so not only does he have his personal finances at stake, but he also understands the more important factor is the future of the studio and its ability to keep a team of developers together.</p>



<p>He also cites <strong>NetEase</strong>, which invested in Liquid Swords in 2021, as a partner that has significantly helped Liquid Swords get to the point it's at now, where it is inching closer to releasing its debut game. But the studio isn't taking anything for granted, and is doing what it can to keep the lights on, which Sundberg admitted also included laying off <strong>half</strong> of the team at Liquid Swords to make sure they could get Samson out the door.</p>



<p>"<em>We have very careful cash-flow planning as we are on a limited budget. Last year, we made the tough decision to lay off (I don't call it 'restructuring' or any other BS term for what it actually is) <strong>half the team,</strong> to buy us a longer runway into 2026. We made a bet, and we do everything we can to deliver a fun $25 experience to lay the foundation for the future. I hope our future players will see the potential in our work and follow us on our journey to make something bigger</em>."</p>



<p>We can't know when the industry will get over the "<em>hangover</em>" it's been dealing with, which has resulted in countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">studio shutdowns and thousands of developers losing their jobs</a> over the last few years, but Sundberg is right on the money with how the industry is incredibly 'risk-averse' right now. One of the key takeaways from <a href="https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/">Matthew Ball's State of Video Gaming 2026 report was how private investment in the industry continues to decline.</a></p>



<p>Even though we're still getting some great games to play, the best gaming experiences always come from creators trying something new, and that means taking risks. Creatives understand how important it is to take risks. Hopefully, the bean counters of the industry will start to understand that more as well.</p>

			<p><strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>, the debut project from <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, the team founded by <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> (that's the <strong>Just Cause</strong> and <strong>Mad Max</strong> people, not the <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> studio <strong>Avalanche Software</strong>) founder, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PC first on <strong>April 8, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After being founded in 2020, the studio is now only weeks away from releasing its debut title, six years later. The game stars Samson McCray, a classic tough guy and driver who returns to his home town of Tyndalston with a heavy debt to pay on his shoulders. He'll have to take jobs each day to try and pay off that debt, while also trying to reluctantly make Tyndalston home again, not just for his own survival, but for his sister, who put everything on the line to make sure he got to keep breathing.</p>



<p>The game kicks off with Samson returning to the city after a job in St. Louis goes south, and as you'll see in the gameplay trailer below, he'll have to work off his debt by breaking plenty of skulls for anyone who'll pay him.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've spent a large part of my career building massive games,</em>" said Sundberg in a press release. "<em>With Samson, we knew that bigger doesn't always equal better and had to be extremely deliberate in what we built. Samson is the result of our team's work, tirelessly fine-tuning what our players expect, and more importantly, what makes games fun."</em></p>



<p><em>"<strong>It's not bloated, it's all about focus, and we keep players at the center of every decision</strong>. Fans of gritty 90's action flicks have something to look forward to when Samson releases on April 8th. Buckle up, because <strong>you're in for a ride</strong></em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>All the way back in 2020, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, the founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong>, established a new video game studio after taking some time off once he left Avalanche after it was acquired in 2018. That studio was (is) <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, a new studio that, six years since its founding, is inching towards releasing its debut project: <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>.</p>



<p>Last week, ahead of Liquid Swords announcing Samson's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a>,</strong> release date, I got to spend some time hearing from Sundberg and the development team about Samson before going hands-on with the game myself. I also got to ask Sundberg and mission designer <strong>Donald Young</strong> a bunch of questions I had about the game, and about Liquid Swords. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">You'll be able to read that interview here.</a></p>



<p>For now, I have a bunch of thoughts about what I played, which was a little more than an hour into the game and its first couple of story missions before the end of the preview session.</p>



<h2 id="h-samson-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale">Samson Hands-On Preview - "Intensity Over Scale"</h2>



<h3 id="h-samson-is-not-gta-and-it-s-not-aaa">"Samson is Not GTA, and It's Not AAA"</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_06-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The quote in the headline of this preview, "<em>Intensity over scale</em>," comes directly from Sundberg, who said it while he was delivering what he prefaced as a bit of a disclaimer. When Samson was first being showcased, even from its first in-game screenshots that the studio showed off, players immediately began comparing it to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/">Grand Theft Auto</a></strong>, a comparison that the studio had not made itself, according to Sundberg, nor was it one the studio wanted.</p>



<p>"<em>Since this has been a hot topic ever since we showed that 10-second video of the city, we have been constantly compared to GTA, and we have never compared ourselves to GTA. Never ever. <strong>Samson is not GTA, and it's not AAA.</strong> It's a focused, mid-budget game built for <strong>intensity over scale</strong>, and priced accordingly, and it's designed around tight systems instead of endless content sprawl. So our ambition is different, our scope is different.</em>"</p>



<p>It was a significant way to start the presentation, but while its intention was to try and get me and the rest of the attendees not to compare Samson to GTA, while I can't speak for everyone else who was there, it definitely made me do nothing but constantly think of GTA while I was playing Samson.</p>



<p>And I know I probably won't be alone in that. I mean, GTA is such a dominant force in the industry and is a franchise that hundreds of millions of players have deep memories and connections to. A game just has to be set in a big city where you play as a criminal who can drive around and steal other cars to be reminiscent of GTA for most people.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_10-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though, as you might expect, the creative director talking about the video game he is leading a team to build knows what the game they're making is and what it isn't. It's definitely not GTA, and for my money, it's all the better for it.</p>



<p>You'll step into the shoes of Samson McCray, the best getaway driver Tyndalston has ever seen, who took a job in St. Louis that he probably would have driven in the opposite direction of, if he knew it would end with him in prison, and while stuck there, his sister is forced to make a bad deal with worse people just to keep her brother breathing.</p>



<p>But Samson isn't prescient, so after the St. Louis job goes south, he winds up back in Tyndalston, appropriately in the city's South End district, and by the terms of the deal that was cut, he's got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/">massive debt he needs to work off</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That's the narrative establishment for the gameplay loop, which sees you get in your car (which Liquid Swords calls the <strong>'Magnum Opus</strong>'), and drive across Tyndalston to one of eight job types each day, trying to earn enough to pay your daily dues and keep debt collectors off your back. I got to experience a few different job types in the time I played, jumping between jobs that got me behind the wheel and ones that called for fisticuffs.</p>



<p>I much preferred how the brawling hand-to-hand combat felt over the driving missions, though I chalk some of that up to the technical issues I had. Myself and the rest of the press that attended this preview were playing an early build, with plenty of known bugs, and even though the release date isn't too far off, I'm not going to knock a version of the game people will (hopefully) never see on their devices. That said, I'll be looking forward to getting a better feel for the driving when the game is actually out.</p>



<p>Even with my issues, the missions I played did make me understand what Young and Sundberg are talking about when they say Samson is about "<em>Intensity over scale</em>."</p>



<h3 id="h-a-story-split-by-action-points">A Story Split by Action Points</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Part of why I got that comes from Samson's visuals. It's a very good-looking game for such a grimy-looking city, and its action sequences have a great cinematic feel to them with the way the camera zooms in when Samson gets into a fight or how the action slows down when you take out another car in a huge crash.</p>



<p>Moving through all of your missions in a single in-game day will have you go back-to-back with those kinds of moments, which, as long as missions can keep an element of variety to them, probably won't get old very quickly. Or, at least, even if it does, as we learned from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-will-feature-elements-mad-max-just-cause-main-story-10-hours-bump-to-25/">FAQ that Liquid Swords put out in December 2025,</a> the main story should only take you about <strong>10 hours</strong> to finish up. You can more than double that game time with side content, but it can be a shorter, action-packed experience if you want it to be.</p>



<p>Especially with how the choices you make in each in-game day really dictate the kind of experience you get. Each day in Tyndalston is broken up into three sections: <strong>Noon, Evening, and Night</strong>. Each of those sections includes two <strong>Action Points</strong>, and accepting missions consumes Action Points. If each mission requires two APs, you'll do three missions that day.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Every new day moves the story forward, and every choice you make - or don't make - impacts how South End sees your Samson McCray. The missions you'll see pop up on your map each day that'll pay enough to help you square away your debt seem to consistently consume two APs, but they're not the only source of missions in Tyndalston.</p>



<p>You'll also be able to find missions to go on throughout the city, just by paying attention to what's happening around you and what NPCs are saying. Liquid Swords calls it the game's "<em>Story Deck system</em>," which spawns small events across the city for you to happen upon.</p>



<p>Granted, this was not an element of Samson I got to play around with in this preview; I only had so much time to play the game, and I was trying to get a handle on the game's core content, so I really only played more campaign-focused missions. But what makes these 'story deck' missions intriguing is the possibility of where they'll take you. I stopped and listened to plenty of NPC chatter when moving from mission to mission, and I'm looking forward to pulling at those many threads in the full release.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_09-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my interview with Young and Sundberg, Young used the example of Story Deck missions as to how your daily choices impact your experience. Stopping to help someone might mean you don't get the chance to take on a different mission that day, causing you to be short on your daily debt payment. But helping that person will have an impact on how the people of South End and Tyndalston see you, just like not making that choice will also have an impact.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we won't know how much of an impact those choices will really have until playing the full game, but the impression I got was that you can ignore those smaller events without little consequence beyond missing out on that section of the game. But again, that's only after spending a little more than an hour with the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-kiss-action">'KISS' Action</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_07-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like some of the best action movies ever made, Samson <strong>doesn't try to fix what isn't broken</strong>. Its brawling hand-to-hand combat follows simple rules. You have a light and heavy punch, you can dodge, you can parry, but most importantly, you can smash up the environment around you with your enemies' faces.</p>



<p>Creatively using your environment to dispatch your foes one-by-one is something that will never get old for me, and it's an element of close-quarters combat design that is a true art when it's done well. Again, these are all just impressions based on a short time with it, but what I saw is that Liquid Swords is doing its best to put you in a variety of situations with more than just the same few set pieces around you repeated across the city.</p>



<p>It's car combat also follows a similar 'KISS' mantra, because when you're in the heat of a chase, landing a solid blow that sends the car you're chasing flying into the air off the curb is always cool. You do have to take proper care of your car; it won't repair itself after you toss it around trying to hit other cars. But how that impacts the game's pacing is another element I couldn't try due to my limited time with the game. Still, it's an interesting element to note that has plenty of potential for what it could add.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-bang-for-buck-approach-that-i-hope-pays-off">A Bang for Buck Approach That I Hope Pays Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_HandtoHandCombat_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As Sundberg clearly stated, Samson: A Tyndalston Story isn't trying to be a big AAA game. It's a smaller scale, AA game, focused on deep exploration within a specific setting, intense vehicular and hand-to-hand combat, with a grounded and gritty story.</p>



<p>I'm not so sure it'll be able to execute on the story front. For what it's worth after playing so little of it, I'm not immediately impressed by any of the writing or performances so far. That could change of course, and I hope it does, because if Samson can deliver a story that's on par with the gameplay experiences it has on offer, this could easily be one of the best games in 2026.</p>



<p>Especially when you add that this game is only coming in at <strong>$25.</strong> Sundberg has been clear on his personal <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/2026279277214208501">X (formerly Twitter) account that he'd rather overdeliver at a lower price</a>, and it seems like he and the team at Liquid Swords are on the right path to achieve that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The beginning of a new calendar year in the video game industry has, unfortunately, once again been marked by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">mass layoffs</a></strong> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"> <strong>studio shutdowns</strong></a>. And while last year was kicked off by a brand new free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">becoming a smash success,</a> this year is marked by the exact opposite. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play game on the market from former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> developers at <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, is the first major misfire of 2026.</p>



<p>After it was debuted at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, a lot was said online about a game that no one had played, while Wildlight kept its head down, preparing for its impending launch on <strong>January 26, 2026</strong>. Then it arrived, and despite hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K concurrent players</strong> on Steam</a>, it couldn't keep those numbers. Players started <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">ripping the game apart in user reviews</a>, and just two weeks after launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">Wildlight laid off <strong>"<em>most</em></strong>" of the development team</a>.</p>



<p>One of those laid-off developers has <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">given their version of events</a> as to how Highguard's failure transpired, but now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has provided a bit more insight into what happened with the studio after speaking to several of the former Wildlight Entertainment developers.</p>



<p>The short version of the answer, according to the developers Schreier spoke to, is that Highguard failed because of the "<em><strong>hubris</strong></em>" of its leadership team, who believed they could recreate the kind of instant success that Apex Legends had when it was shadow-dropped in 2019. That's also part of the long answer, but the long answer also includes a fairly big hole that was missed during the game's testing.</p>



<p>In the report, it's pointed out that Wildlight never properly addressed the fact that when they tested the game with external players and turned their microphones off, it created a drastically different experience compared to when players could vocally communicate with each other. There are a lot of systems to learn in Highguard, and without being able to talk it out with other players, the testing results were more negative than positive. It also didn't help that having members of the Wildlight team on hand to aid players who were confused about what to do didn't provide accurate playtesting conditions for their results.</p>



<p>Having a hole or two in its testing process ultimately wasn't the sole reason for Highguard's downfall, but it does feel like a significant component that explains a bit about why it launched as such a mish-mash of genres.</p>



<p>As for those remaining at Wildlight, the report confirms that there are "<em><strong>less than 20 people</strong></em>" left at the studio, trying to salvage the shooter. It also adds that <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-website-remains-down-fans-worry-this-is-it/"><strong>Tencent</strong>, which was revealed to be the main source of the studio's funds</a>, had cut its funding once Highguard failed to reach certain launch expectations. Losing Tencent's funding is why the studio had mass layoffs just two weeks after launch.</p>



<p>If it's able to pull off a comeback, it wouldn't be the first game to beat such high odds, and it's always better to see a studio beat the odds instead of succumbing to them. But laying all your hopes in slim chances like that is its own kind of hubris.</p>

<p>April 8th, to be exact, as revealed with a fresh trailer at today's Ian Games Network Fan Fest. Said trailer showed off more of 90s action flick-inspired goon-drubbing sessions and road-based ramming that the studio have established as the stuff leather-jacketed protagonist Samson has to do in order to keep his ever-present debt in check. You owe people more money by the day and therefore you've got bust balls throughout the grey metropolis of Tyndalston like a working class Batman.</p>
<p>Sundberg suggests the studio have aimed for a highly focused romp that keeps the pace up and feeds Samson baddies to bash as quickly as he can dispatch them with his mitts or smash them into the scenery using his black V8 beast. Liquid Swords offered a bit more info on those two key elements in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i111LkVVaYI">recent dev diary</a>.</p><p>In terms of brawls, they've opted against giving you a gun or overpowered attacks in an effort to have every fight be a dirty slug-fest that encourages using everything at your disposal to win. "You can walk into a nice clean room and totally wreck the place," principal programmer Strati Zerbinis explained. "The world is not just an arena in which you have a fight, the world is part of the fight. You can use everything you break. You can take broken things and make them into weapons. You can knock stuff over onto people. Debris can get in enemies' ways. Heavy stuff can fall and kill people." That's pressing some nice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> or Yakuza-ish buttons in my brain, provided all of the destruction feels weighty enough to be satisfying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the car combat side, senior designer Alex Williams explained that the momentum, speed, and mass of vehicles dictates the level of damage done by a crash, then got a bit philosophical. "I don't want to feel a car just die. Cars don't die. They're made up of lots of different parts. We have a part system - there's tires, wheels, the engine - these can all degrade [and] the player will feel [in] that car the consequences of how those parts are damaged."</p>
<p>Sounds like to could be cool. Samson's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7">Epic Store</a>, if you're so inclined ahead of its April debut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to head back to the backyard for an all-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-baseball/" id="2001">Backyard Baseball</a> title. Appropriately enough, it should make everyone’s summer vacation a little more lively as the game launches on July 9, 2026.</p>



<p>The release date for the upcoming title was announced on social media. The game is being developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-cat-studios/" id="3592">Mega Cat Studios</a>, and they’ve ported several classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-sports/" id="1860">Backyard Sports</a> titles to PC via Steam. This forthcoming release will be playable on PC and Mac and will get console releases.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>History of Backyard Sports</h2>



<p>The first Backyard Baseball was released in 1997. The games were minimalistic PC titles featuring a diverse roster of children playing many sports, the first of which was Backyard Baseball. Games eventually made it to platforms such as the original Sony PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, and the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Still, they were always available on home computers through 2009.</p>



<p>The football version of Backyard Sports even spun off an animated special in 2002.</p>



<p>Now, a new generation of children, not to mention adults looking for the nostalgic hit of that silly sports game that they might have picked up at a Scholastic Book Fair, will get the chance to play an all-new Backyard Baseball this summer.</p>







<h2>PC Specs for Backyard Baseball 2026</h2>



<p>The 4th coming game will feature six different game modes with three ways to play. There will also be achievements, unlockables, and collectibles. However, the developers are boasting that this game won’t have microtransactions.</p>



<p>The minimum required PC specs have been made available. Check them out below:</p>
