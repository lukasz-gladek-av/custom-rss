<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that Alan Wake 2 has sold 1.8 million units to date.</p>



<p>The news came via the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s capital markets day</a>, during which the company deep-dived into its financials and past and future projects. During the presentations, it was announced that Alan Wake 2 sold 1.8 million units since its October 2023 release date (just over one year).</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Remedy Entertainment announced that the game was close to fully recouping its development and marketing costs with its ongoing sales. Still, it’s unclear if the game has become profitable at the time of writing. However, the recent sales numbers show that 1.8 million times 70 dollars (the high-end average) would put the total amount generated at approximately $126 million.</p>



<p>Released on October 27, 2023, Alan Wake 2 received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic and sold one million units by February 2024. The game won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2023, including Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction.</p>

                <p>Rebirth Island has been removed from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> playlist due to "map-specific issues," just hours after the popular map returned. Players are waiting on further updates from Treyarch to find out when the map is likely to be returned to rotation.</p><p>It's a busy time for Warzone, after its big integration with Black Ops 6 and Season 1 launch last week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-anti-cheat-and-weapon-changes/2900-5947/" data-ref-id="2900-5947">The update</a> brought Black Ops 6 operators, weapons, and even game features to Warzone, as well as the new Area 99 Resurgence map, however the integration hasn't been without its hiccups. Players have experienced issues, especially with game audio, as well as with performance on PC.</p><p>Players might have been looking forward to playing the popular Rebirth Island map when it was re-added to Warzone with this week's playlist refresh, but the map was pulled from rotation just over three hours after it was added.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <br>We've removed Rebirth Island from the playlist while we investigate map-specific issues.

                <p>The shojo-anime-tinged farming game Fields of Mistria is getting its first major content patch.

Skill caps across the board have been raised from 30 to 45. You can also encounter two new monsters in the mines--the Essence Bat and the Mimic--and pick up new rare cosmetic items from them.</p><p>In romance and relationships, you can now raise your affection with romancable NPCs to six hearts.

		<p>The Binding of Isaac has received a new free DLC today, called Repentance+, that adds online multiplayer to the game. The new update allows up to four players to play together and run through the game. However, to run the new Repentance+ DLC, all players will require all of the previously released DLC for The Binding of Isaac for it to work, and mods are not compatible with the online side of the game. While Nicalis is calling this a beta, it has been confirmed this DLC is feature complete.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ Beta Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7yPmbNCP4I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Binding of Isaac Repentance+ players can play on Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier and do Challenges. There are also Daily Runs that will provide different challenges for players to tackle too. Achievements can be unlocked online, but only if you are present from the start of a run. Joining partway through a run will not count towards unlocking any achievements. Online play has some differences from solo play, including defeated bosses dropping loot for each player. Those who join a run partway through will be given items so they are not at a disadvantage compared to players who were present from the beginning. If a player dies, the rest of the team can choose to revive a player at a revive machine on each floor, though the cost of revival goes up every time a machine is used. Alternatively, the remaining players can try and defeat bosses without their fallen teammates as being successful also revives teammates. The full changelog can be seen below.</p>

<p>Item Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tammy’s Head – Reduced the duration of the animation when using Tammy’s Head, allowing Isaac to fire more quickly after use.</li>
<li>Lemon Mishap – Slightly increased the size of the puddle. Also, the puddle will now persist until Isaac exits the room.</li>
<li>Mega Bean – Creates a catastrophic fart that sweeps the entire room.</li>
<li>Milk! – The familiar now follows closely behind Isaac and blocks shots. After 10 hits, the glass will break and give Isaac a Tears upgrade for the remainder of the floor.</li>
<li>Delirious – Summoned bosses will now persist through rooms. Only one boss can be active at a time. The charge is now variable, based on the quality of the previously summoned boss.</li>
<li>Jar of Wisps – Reduced to a 6-room charge, allowing the wisps to stack up to the maximum number more quickly.</li>
<li>Abyss – Item quality now impacts the damage of the summoned locust. Locusts now inherit many different effects based on the item destroyed by Abyss.</li>
<li>Flip – Charge has been reduced to 4 rooms for Tainted Lazarus only.</li>
<li>Portable Slot – Removed from the Shop pool. Added as a possible reward from slot machines.</li>
<li>Void – Charge has been reduced from 6 rooms to 4.</li>
<li>Epiphora – The Tears upgrade from firing in a single direction is now a smooth increase, instead of being staggered every few seconds.</li>
<li>God’s Flesh – Doubled the chance of shrink tears firing. Shrunken enemies now briefly flash white before growing back to full size. Enemies that explode, fire shots or summon minions on death can no longer hurt Isaac if they’re killed while shrunken.</li>
<li>Hushy – While held in place, Hushy now fires radial bursts of shots.</li>
<li>It Hurts – After taking damage, Isaac’s tears will now leave behind small pools of blood creep for the room.</li>
<li>Mars – In addition to being invulnerable when charging, Isaac will gain a 1-second bubble of invulnerability after the charge. Hitting obstacles also causes a knockback effect to clear any threats from the surrounding area.</li>
<li>Evil Charm – Isaac now gains immunity to spider-web slowdown, flame attacks, fireplaces and poison mushrooms. Isaac can also stand in enemy creep for 1 second before taking damage.</li>
<li>Vasculitis – Friendly radial shots fired after killing an enemy will now appear as blood clots to more easily distinguish them.</li>
<li>Lil’ Portal – Has been completely reworked. Double-tapping a fire button is now required to launch Lil’ Portal. After it has consumed enough items and the room is clear, a single portal will spawn and the familiar will now disappear for the remainder of the floor. Entering this portal now takes Isaac to a room where he can pick up or drop off items. This room persists throughout the rest of the current run.</li>
<li>Linger Bean – The fart cloud is now deployed after 4 seconds of continuous fire (instead of 7 seconds). The cloud starts small and potent, and will grow and deal reduced damage over the course of 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Jupiter – Now heals 2 red hearts instead of just ½.</li>
<li>Butter Bean – Recharge time has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2.</li>
<li>The Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Kidney Bean – Can now be re-used after a 4-second cooldown (instead of a room charge).</li>
<li>Dead Bird – Will remain active between rooms as long as the player is at ½ heart. (Note: Eve requires 1 full heart.)</li>
<li>Data Miner – Using Data Miner in a room with an item pedestal will now reroll it into a glitched item.</li>
</ul>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Overdrive Mode, which introduced path tracing to the game, continues to be the most impressive showcase of the technology to date despite being among the very first games to implement it, as highlighted by a new comparison video shared online.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 2, and Desordre running without ray tracing, with ray tracing and with path tracing, highlighting the differences between the different rendering techniques. While the differences path tracing brings to Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth: Wukong, for example, are minimal in most scenarios, they are really transformative in Cyberpunk 2077, elevating the game's visuals to heights that no open-world game has managed to match to date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ray Tracing vs Path Tracing in 6 Games - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lixD81ToGcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While developer CD Projekt Red stopped supporting Cyberpunk 2077, the development team having moved on to working on the second entry in the series, the game is still getting image quality improvements thanks to mods and new NVIDIA DLSS versions. The upscaler's latest version, version 3.8.10, brings significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nvidia-dlss-3-8-10-performance-improvements/">anti-aliasing, VRAM, and performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the 2.0 update and the Phantom Liberty expansion released last year on PC and current generation consoles in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-aim-assist-settings-for-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Aim is everything in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>, as you’ll need to stay accurate to get the fastest TTK possible. While using the meta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-krig-c-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dragons-breath-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attachments</a> helps a lot, having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best and most comfortable aim settings</a> can be extremely beneficial, especially on controller.</p>



<p>This is mainly due to Aim Assist, and while it’s been nerfed in BO6, it remains a fundamental advantage that controller players will want to make the most of. That said, here are the best Aim Assist settings in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-aim-assist-settings-in-bo6">Best Aim Assist Settings in BO6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity Multiplier: </strong>Preference</li>



<li><strong>Look Inversion (On Foot): </strong>Standard</li>



<li>Aiming Advanced Settings
<ul>
<li><strong>Look Inversion (all):</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Transition Timing:</strong> Gradual</li>



<li><strong>3rd Person ADS Correction Type: </strong>Assist</li>



<li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Standard</li>



<li><strong>Custom Sensitivity Per Zoom:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Target Aim Assist: </strong>On</li>



<li><strong>Motion Sensor Behavior:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>



<p>The most important setting here is Target Aim Assist as if you turn this off, you won’t receive any help when your crosshairs are near an enemy. It’s important to note that Aim Assist has been nerfed in BO6, as the devs reduced its strength when in close-quarters combat. Also, there are no longer multiple Aim Assist options, with the devs deciding to simplify the aiming system for controller.</p>



<p>Other controller settings like Sensitivity and Deadzone Inputs will further help your accuracy and therefore increase the effectiveness of Aim Assist, so it’s important to have these settings dialed in too. We recommend playing around with different Sensitivity settings and choosing one that feels comfortable, and as for Deadzone, reduce the right stick value to as low as 3, but if your stick is drifting, increase this value until the drift stops.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-aim-assist-setting-in-bo6">Where to find Aim Assist setting in BO6</h2>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Call of Duty.</li>



<li>Go to Black Ops 6.</li>



<li>Head to Settings.</li>



<li>Scroll to the Controller tab and then Aiming.</li>



<li>You’ll find Aim Assist under the second section.</li>
</ol>



<p>Aim Assist is a controversial topic for competitive online FPS games, as the war between mouse and keyboard vs controller continues. </p>

<p>As per the latest reports, Pokemon TCG Pocket has raked in over $120.8 million between October 30 and November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a> (shared via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketGamer</a>), Pokemon TCG Pocket reached over $100 million in earnings on November 15 and exceeded $120 million by November 17. The game has been generating over $6.4 million in daily player spending since launch, with November 17 marking its highest earnings at $8.2 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its first week, Pokemon TCG Pocket earned $35.8 million. In the second week, earnings increased to $48.5 million, and in the third week, they reached $37.2 million with a few days still remaining.</p>



<p>When it comes to regional spending, fans from Japan are the most significant contributors, accounting for 42% of the global expenditure, with a total of $50.6 million spent. The United States follows, making up 28% of global spending with $33.6 million.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket has made an impressive debut, surpassing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads in just the first 9 days</a> and generating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $12 million in revenue within the first 4 days</a>. The title is currently in contention to become the franchise’s biggest mobile launch, as it is only $18 million shy of Pokémon GO’s earnings from its first 19 days.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has now surpassed $120m in total earnings since its release three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The mobile game reached $100m on 15th November, 17 days after release. This was also its highest-earning day yet, earning $8.2m from player spending according to data from AppMagic (shared by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>As of 17th November, the game has generated $120.8m. On average, it's made almost $6.4m each day since release.</p>

<p>In its first week, Pokémon TCG Pocket made $35.8m. Then it made a further $48.5m in its second week. For its third week, the game has so far generated $37.2m.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, 42 percent of global spending has been in Japan, with the US in second place generating 28 percent of revenue.</p>
<p>As we previously reported, the game reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m in its first four days</a>.</p>
<p>However, Pokémon GO had a bigger launch, with $58m earned in its first week. It remains the most popular Pokémon mobile game.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">more will be coming to TCG Pocket soon</a>, with new booster packs due "by the end of the year" and card trading arriving early next year.</p>
<p>It also looks like its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">next events will be Bulbasaur themed</a>, according to a datamine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The widely reported PS5 Pro issues seen in the Silent Hill 2 remake and Star Wars Jedi Survivor are being looked into, Bloober Team and EA confirmed a few hours ago.</p>
<p>As for the remake of the second entry in the series, developer <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloober Team</a> confirmed they are currently working on the issues replying to a user's question without specifying if every image quality issue is being addressed or when. Likewise, Star Wars Jedi Survivor issues have been <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be under active investigation, but no further detail was provided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re working on it!</p>
<p>— Bloober Team (@BlooberTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlooberTeam/status/1858610797871513693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re aware of issues with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PlayStation 5 Pro and are actively investigating.</p>
<p>— EA Star Wars (@EAStarWars) <a href="https://twitter.com/EAStarWars/status/1858635462577172846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite the developers not providing additional details, it's good to know that the PS5 Pro issues in both games are being looked into. Silent Hill 2 and Star Wars Jedi Survivor, however, aren't the only games that suffer from image quality issues on new consoles, but it is not yet known if anything can be done for other games that could only implement <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">older versions&nbsp;of the PSSR upscaler</a> due to having been developed using an SDK older than version 10, the only one that supports the latest versions of the AI-powered upscaler.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not all PS5 Pro-enhanced games suffer from image quality issues. In games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the developers have done an excellent job taking advantage of the console's features to offer significantly improved experiences. You can learn more about the new features the console offers by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Developer Blackbird Interactive has detailed its forthcoming final update for Homeworld 3.</p>
<p>This chunky update, which the team describe as being "mothership-sized" with a "gargantuan number" of improvements and such, is set to go live on 21st November.</p>
<p>It will include a combat overhaul, while Blackbird has also completely redone how damage and armour works within the game. In addition, on the multiplayer side of things, the team has significantly increased the difficulty of Standard and Hard AI opponents in Skirmish. This was made following community feedback.</p>

The news network adds, “The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.”</p><p>Kadokawa is a Japanese media conglomerate that owns a huge array of businesses, across manga, anime, tourism, video streaming, and some of the most significant names in Japanese games development. That includes Spike Chunsoft, the developer behind <em>Danganronpa</em>, <em>Mystery Dungeon</em>, and most recently, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

With Sony already owning Crunchyroll and Funimation, there are obvious concerns over Sony’s dominance in this area.</p><p>Of course, the headline name is FromSoftware, responsible for <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Armored Core</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>.

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard's co-directors have discussed BioWare's push to return to its roots in character-focused single-player role-playing games, after its recent struggles with both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a> and Anthem.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corinne-busche-john-epler-game-directors-dragon-age/id1665581266?i=1000677429520">My Perfect Console</a> podcast, The Veilguard directors Corinne Busche and John Epler said BioWare had been supported by publisher EA in returning to what the studio had always done best, after seeing its focus diluted by chasing industry trends. 
</p>
<p>
"I felt very supported through this by BioWare and EA," Busche said, on Dragon Age: The Veilguard's development. "And I'll tell you, it's intimidating to buck the trends in an era where it feels like almost every game must be an open world. 
</p>
<p>
"It's [being able to say], you know what - that works for those titles. For us, the way in which we tell the best stories and stay true to our roots - a more handcrafted, intimate solution is appropriate. And just to have that support from within, around getting back to those elements we do best, was fantastic."
</p><p>
Epler, a BioWare veteran of 17 years, said that the studio's focus with The Veilguard had been a deliberate push to return to its "very real strength" in character-building and storytelling, after "projects that maybe didn't centre that strength as well as they could have". 
</p>
<p>
"You know, I personally love Mass Effect Andromeda but there was also - we had open-world that was a big thing in the industry at the time and that starts to dilute your focus," Epler said. "We had Anthem - live-service dilutes your focus. 
</p>
<p>
"So for us it was really understanding what it is that people come to the studio to do - they work here for a reason, they want to make big stories that... allow you to be a big hero of your own creation, but also a focus on characters, a focus on that experience of living in a different world. 
</p>
<p>
"For The Veilguard we just wanted to get back to those things that made the studio what it was, that contributed to what I would call the Golden Age of BioWare, when there was hit after hit being turned out. The Veilguard was a very conscious return to that with a focus on characters, storytelling and being just this really bombastic single-player RPG."
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a decade-long on-off development and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-says-next-dragon-age-will-now-be-single-player-only-due-to-anthems-fortunes-reversing-eas-original-plans">at one point was set to include multiplayer elements until EA and BioWare changed tack</a>, resulting in the brilliant single-player RPG that ultimately released last month. 
</p>
<p>Story ideas for the game lasted throughout that time, however, as can be seen in some of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-had-dragon-age-the-veilguards-look-nailed-10-years-ago">Dragon Age: The Veilguard's earliest concept art</a>, which has now been shared online. But perhaps this shouldn't be too surprising? After all, as we found out from Dragon Age creator David Gaider, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare knew the deepest secrets of Dragon Age lore 20 years ago, and locked it away in an uber-plot document</a>.</p>
<p>
"A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle. This is the best Dragon Age, and perhaps BioWare, has ever been," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has added the brilliant soundtrack to N64 classic F-Zero X to its music app.</p>
<p>The high-speed futuristic racer has a pounding electro-rock soundtrack, with courses like Mute City and Big Blue featuring particularly iconic music.</p>
<p>And now you can listen to them on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo's new music app</a>, made available a couple of weeks back.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of Dream Chaser, which accompanies the Silence course, those wailing electric guitars matching its intensity of speed.</p>
<p>Still, we need the F-Zero GX on the app next please Nintendo!</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-adds-30-banging-wii-sports-tunes">soundtrack to Wii Sports was added to the app</a>. It's unclear at what cadence Nintendo will be making additions, but if it's weekly then who knows what's next. Can we get Wave Race: Blue Storm too?</p>
<p>Whatever is added, you'll find a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">full list of available game soundtracks in our Nintendo Music app guide</a>.</p>
<p>F-Zero is certainly having a bit of a renaissance at the moment. First there was battle royale F-Zero 99 for Switch Online that's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-secret-tracks-private-lobbies-added">regularly updated with new tracks</a> and Satellaview exclusives. Then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-f-zero-game-speeds-on-to-switch-this-week-at-maximum-velocity">Nintendo added Game Boy Advance launch game F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</a> to its Switch Online collection.</p>
<p>Most recently, Nintendo followed that up with two more Game Boy Advance F-Zero games, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-f-zero-games-headed-to-switch-online-including-previously-japan-only-release">Japan-only F-Zero Climax</a>.</p>
<p>Can we dare to dream a new original game could be on the way? Until then, I'd recommend giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aero-gpx-is-the-f-zero-gx-sequel-nintendo-wont-make">indie game Aero GPX</a> a go on Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mojang Studios has entered a partnership with theme park operator Merlin Entertainments to introduce real-life Minecraft experiences across the globe, beginning in the UK and US.</p>
<p>Merlin Entertainments - which is also behind tourist hot spots such as Alton Towers and Legoland, to name but two - is investing in excess of £85m in the first two planned Minecraft attractions, marking the company's first global partnership with a gaming brand.</p>

<p>While Merlin and Mojang have not shared specific dates or locations, these "experiences" are expected to launch in the UK and US between 2026 and 2027, and include Minecraft-themed accommodation, along with food, beverages, a themed ride and other "exciting" elements. Following this, Merlin and Mojang will expand this partnership - known as "Adventures Made Real" - further afield.</p>
<p>"This is a significant milestone for Merlin, which reinforces our commitment to reaching new audiences through bold and captivating concepts, and directly supports our ambitions for growth," Scott O'Neil, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, said today.</p>
<p>"Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, and this world-first will see fans experience its thrill and creativity in real life, at theme parks and city-centre attractions in leading tourist destinations."</p>

<p>"Partnering with Merlin Entertainments is an incredibly exciting step for us at Mojang Studios. Merlin's expertise in creating world-class attractions makes them the perfect partner to help us bring Minecraft to life in new and immersive ways in permanent locations around the globe," Kayleen Walters, vice-president franchise development for gaming at Microsoft, added. Microsoft acquired Mojang and Minecraft back in 2014, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-mojang-and-minecraft">deal worth $2.5bn</a>.</p>
<p>"Our vast and diverse community is always looking for new opportunities to explore and engage with Minecraft, and we are thrilled to build touchpoints around the globe that will surprise and delight them," Walters continued. </p>
<p>
"These new real-life Minecraft experiences will not only grow our community but also offer fans many more opportunities to immerse themselves in the world of Minecraft in ways they've never imagined."</p>

<p>Along with these upcoming attractions, Minecraft also has a number of other projects in the pipeline, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action film starring Jack Black as Steve</a> (see trailer above) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series.</p>
<p>Netflix will produce this project alongside Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development. While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of Minecraft in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Blimey guvnor! Ubisoft has only gone and slapped a shiny ol' update on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, that game set in Victorian London.
</p>
<p>
Ahem. First released in 2015, it's something of a surprise to see Syndicate get an update now. But as Assassin's Creed fans are now waiting until February for the upcoming Japan-set Shadows, it's perhaps a good time to give this enjoyable romp a revisit.
</p>
<p>
Last night, Ubisoft issued a patch that added 60FPS support on Xbox Series X and S, as well as on PlayStation 5 and the newly-launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Details of the update as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5wlBeqYoDHhzrh61xMNj7R">shared</a> by Ubisoft lie below.
</p>
<p><strong>Xbox (~31.8 GB)</strong></p>

<li>4K resolution at 60 fps</li>

<li>1080p resolution at 60 fps</li>

<ul>
<li>PS5 and PS5 Pro</li>
<li>1080p resolution at 60 fps</li>
<li>4K resolution at 60 fps</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nearly a decade on, Syndicate feels a little overlooked in the Assassin's Creed canon, which is a shame. Its release came at a difficult time for the Assassin's Creed franchise overall - a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">the disaster that was Unity</a>, and while work to softly reboot the series with Origins had already begun.
</p>
<p>
But Syndicate has some great moments, the Frye Twins' co-protagonist mechanic works well, and it hosts a beautiful rendition of London (Big Ben! Leaping between boats on the Thames! A moving steam train hideout!). </p>
<p>
  If you're yet to give it a go, it's a refreshing change from the hardboiled history of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> or the melodrama of Unity. It's also the first time Ubisoft Quebec (the studio behind the upcoming Shadows, as well as the Ancient Greek-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>) got to spearhead a full game for itself.
</p>
<p>
"Syndicate moves Assassin's Creed forward with a solid new adventure, a beautiful London playground and a renewed sense of fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Syndicate review</a>. Cor!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/sony-kadokawa-fromsoftware-elden-ring-bloodborne/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Reuters has published a story that states Sony is looking to acquire the Japanese media conglomerate Kadokawa, which has a number of brands under its various umbrellas. Kadokawa has investments within publishing, films, and the games industry. Most notably with the games industry, Kadokawa owns a majority share of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring developer FromSoftware. It also owns Spike Chunsoft and Acquire.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sony owns a 2% stake in Kadokawa already, with Tencent having approximately 7% of the company. If Sony wanted to outright buy Kadokawa it would have to buy out Tencent’s shares too, though Sony may also choose to keep Tencent has a minority partner in the business. Sony also owns a minority of shares within FromSoftware, so buying Kadokawa would transfer ownership of the Elden Ring developer to Sony, along with ownership of Spike Chunsoft and Acquire. It is not yet clear how much Sony would pay for Kadokawa, but ther reports suggest that deal could be struck within the next few weeks. If Sony does complete this acquisition not only would it boost its videogame portfolio, but it would also expand its presence in the anime and manga markets, book publishing, and also have a bigger presence in the Japanese film industry too.</p>
<p>Kadokawa has recently suffered some setbacks within the last couple of years. In 2022, the chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa was arrested on bribery charges with it being related to becoming an official sponsor for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. He announced he would resign on October 4th, 2022. Earlier this year, Kadokawa became the target of a ransomware attack with its websites being breached. The group behind it, Blacksuit, claimed to hold 1.5 terabytes of stolen data including personnel information and user data.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka would love to see a similar remake for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>, though there are no "concrete plans".</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi">Inverse</a>, Hayasaka discussed the popularity of the HD-2D visual style and whether he'd like to see any other games be remade in this way.</p>
<p>"It’s not that we have concrete plans for this, but personally I would have to say Final Fantasy 6," he said. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> - the first HD-2D title - was developed while referencing FF 6, as it had the highest quality pixel art. I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style."</p>

<p>He continued: "Because this art style itself was created while referencing such titles, it’s highly compatible with games originally made using pixel art. This compatibility is probably why people feel this style is a match made in heaven with these types of remakes."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 would certainly be a popular choice for a remake in this style, alongside the iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. In fact, last year an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/3d-artist-recreates-chrono-trigger-in-hd-2d-style">artist created a HD-2D concept of Chrono Trigger</a> that proved popular on social media.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 is already available on modern platforms as part of the Pixel Remaster collection.</p>
<p>Hayasaka also discussed some of the difficulties of remaking classics in HD-2D, comparing the first teaser for Dragon Quest 3 released three years ago to the final product released last week.</p>
<p>"I’m sure you will find everything to be different, from the map size to the characters’ body proportions," he said. "We get asked why things took so long since the first announcement, but the fact that we needed this much time speaks to how intensely involved the process of applying HD-2D graphics to Dragon Quest 3 truly was.</p><p>"Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth! In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet."</p>
<p>"The HD-2D overhaul is stunning," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake review</a>.</p>
<p>"Blocky sprites are replaced by ones with much higher detail, and they're placed on 3D backgrounds with a camera tilt that still retains the proportions of the old sprite style. It looks exactly how you remember old games felt to play - the goggles of nostalgia made real - only everything's a little smoother now thanks to its new autosave, a greater number of places to save more generally, objective markers to help direct you, and an easier way to teleport between visited locations."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/new-world-aeternum-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Set during the Age of Exploration, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/new-world-aeternum">New World: Aeternum</a> asks what would happen if – instead of the Americas – we stumbled upon a volatile fantasy realm where legends come to life. And where they never perish…</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an adventurer who takes to the high seas, you soon find yourself shipwrecked on its stormy shores, your destiny forever changed. While Aeternum boasts a stunning natural beauty and a bounty of precious resources streaked, there’s a growing corruption sweeping the land, drawing dark and unseen forces into a wider conflict as humans look to make their mark upon this untamed land.</p>


<p>New World: Aeternum is very much an action-oriented MMORPG. The game sports an active combat system similar to souslike RPGs thanks to an intuitive lock-on camera while rewarding well-time blocks and dodges – elements that will feel somewhat alien to fans of traditional MMOs.</p>


<p>These same fans may also baulk at New World’s streamlined character builds. Instead of choosing a class and gradually filling the screen with hotbars and icons, players can only slot a total of six abilities (split between their two equipped weapons) with branching skill trees add a satisfying amount of depth. Weapon pairings will ultimately dictate your role in combat, though New World does give the option to freely switch and experiment, allowing you to completely respec without too much admin involved.</p>
<p>The straightforward controls and condensed ability loadouts complement New World’s fresh console ports particularly well. Navigating chat windows and some of the more advanced menus can get a bit finicky on a gamepad yet it feels like the game was always designed with console players in mind, rather than being an afterthought.</p>
<p>Unlocking its doors to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S isn’t the only thing that’s new for New World: Aeternum. Since the game originally launched on PC there have been a glut of content drops, new features, and quality of life improvements. One of the most notable upgrades is a renewed focus on storytelling and worldbuilding through improved character interactions and cutscenes. It’s clear that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/amazon-game-studios">Amazon Game Studios</a> has poured a lot of love into the lore and presentation of its flagship MMO with fully-voiced NPCs and a living in-game codex that grows as you learn more about the realm of Aeternum and its denizens.</p>

<p>Archetypes are another new addition to New World: Aeternum that will help you slip into one of its many flexible playstyles. After all, while the solo levelling experience is relatively agnostic of the weapons you choose, group PvE activities such as Expeditions and Raids – as well as PvP – require players to choose a role whether that’s a thank, DPS, or healer.</p>
<p>However, it will be a while before you can fully immerse yourself in team play with much of this content unlocking when you hit the game’s original level cap of 60. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long to reach this milestone. For my Mystic (New World’s de facto healer/support archetype) it took around 30 hours of mostly main story quests and Expeditions with limited uptake of side missions.</p>
<p>Aside from straight up duels, there are plenty of PvP options in New World including a recently introduced 3 versus 3 Arena and the more objective-based 40-player Outpost Rush. Then there’s the ongoing Faction War that permeates in the game’s persistent world. Soon after washing up on the shores of Aeternum, you can choose to ally with the Covenant, Syndicate, or Marauders, who are locked in a never ending conflict. Through careful planning and brute opportunism Companies (player-run guilds) can occupy the many settlements found spread across the map, first working collectively to gain influence and then throwing down in massive siege battles.</p>

<p>Away from combat and questing, New World offers a comprehensive crafting system that is split between gathering supplies and then processing these into materials, gear, or sellable goods. Choosing a certain archetype will give you a small boost in certain crafting skills though you’re truly free to pursue any at your own leisure, from refining ore and engineering muskets to fishing and building furniture for your home. Oh yes, there’s player housing.</p>
<p>Beyond its walled cities, townships, and makeshift settlements, Aeternum offers a diverse patchwork of biomes each teeming with life. Covered in forests and fauna, there’s an element of untouched natural beauty streaked with the occasional gash of red and a dense dark miasma to signal the presence of corruption. Each region has its own aesthetic and local tales, rewarding inquisitive players with little nuggets of lore and painting a more detailed picture of Aeternum’s mysterious past. These areas are well populated too, New World touting a bestiary of wild animals to hunt as well as a grimoire of exotic creatures from zombie pirates and mystic dryads to cosmic horrors from another dimension.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of next year's most anticipated games is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>. The fantasy RPG franchise originally created by Lionhead is returning fifteen years after its previous mainline installment, and fans are understandably excited.</p>
<p>Since IP owner Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-legends-officially-cancelled-lionhead-studios-closing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Fable Legends and subsequently shut down Lionhead in 2016, they had to pick a new studio to reboot the series from the ground up. As we've known for a few years, that studio is Playground Games. The British team has crafted some stellar games in the Forza Horizon IP, but that's a racing game; could they deliver the same level of quality with an RPG?</p>
<p>That's certainly the biggest question mark at this point. According to Windows Central's Jez Corden, though, there's not much to fear. Speaking in the latest episode of the Xbox Two <a href="https://youtu.be/VmNZUoJnqdg?t=5844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, he claimed to have seen some footage of Fable that looked fantastic, featuring combat modeled after The Witcher series, probably due to Playground having hired some former CDPR employees.</p>
<p><em>I very recently saw some Alpha gameplay footage from Fable. I have no idea when it was from, I don't know if it was earlier in development or if it was recent, but it looked fantastic. You can tell that this game has CD Project Red DNA. Playground Games picked up a bunch of developers, I believe they picked up the combat designer and you can kind of tell. I'm not saying it's 100% one-to-one with The Witcher because it's not, but you can kind of tell with that melee combat, the pirouettes, the dodging, the seamless hack and slash into an execution, which looks really cool. All that stuff is there; it looks super polished, super good. If this was early gameplay, then it probably looks even better now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that,&nbsp;there was a lot of mixing in of different weapon types. There was pulling out a bow and arrow and also dropping spells I saw a spell that lifted a group of dudes off the ground and slammed them down. I also saw some enemies, like a giant chicken, for example. It actually just looked like a chicken with that sort of comedic angle but also not. Like, it looked like a dangerous scary chicken. Also, I saw werewolves. There was a scene where they lured a werewolf out of its lair with bacon and eggs and sausages.</em></p>
<p><em>It looked really great. The combat looked really tight. I saw a variety of weapons. I saw a big mallet thing which was being used to swing around and hit multiple enemies at once. My hype level went up a lot from seeing that stuff, so that's why I'm so bullish on Fable now.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, The Witcher 3's combat was one of its few criticized gameplay elements. Then again, the developers of this new Fable might have simply been inspired by the foundation while polishing it even further. We'll have to wait until we see proper gameplay to tell. With The Game Awards coming up, maybe Microsoft will show a new trailer.</p>
<p>Corden also reported to have heard back at Summer Game Fest that Fable would allow character selection, probably between a male and a female option, which will be good news for those who didn't fancy the character seen in the trailers so far.</p>
<p>Fable is currently slated to launch next year, probably toward the end of 2025, for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation in talks to buy Elden Ring, Dark Souls developer FromSoftware]]></title>
            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware.1039194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Kadokawa buyout would also include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership studio.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is currently in talks that would likely see it acquire a controlling stake in FromSoftware, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Dark Souls and Bloodbourne, as part of a buyout of its owner, the Japanese publishing giant Kadokawa.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/">Reuters</a> report which claims a deal could be signed in weeks, via sources with knowledge of discussions between the two companies. Both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment on that report.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2022, Elden Ring has now sold more than 25m copies worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sony already owns a 14 percent stake in FromSoftware, and already has ownership of both the Bloodborne and Demon Souls franchises. FromSoftware, meanwhile, owns the rights to Elden Ring and Sekiro.</p>
<p>This deal would likely result in PlayStation gaining the 69.6 percent stake in FromSoftware that Kadokawa holds, meaning it would hold a commanding 84 percent of the company. (Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> currently owns the remaining 16 percent.)
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa owns various other studios, too. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and Tenchu developer Acquire, which recently developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> for Nintendo Switch, Shiren the Wanderer studio Spike Chunsoft and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Kadokawa is also a huge name in anime and manga, and would be a significant addition to Sony's existing portfolio that includes Crunchyroll and Funimation. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's other recent purchases include UK studio Firesprite, plus Housemarque and Nixxes, all in 2021. Most recently, Sony bought the Jade Raymond-founded startup Haven Studios in 2022, currently working on Fairgame$.
