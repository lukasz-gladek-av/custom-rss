			<p>Life simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">inZOI</a> arrived in early access last week on March 28, 2025, and in its first seven days, the new game from developer inZOI Studio and publisher Krafton has already eclipsed 1 million copies sold.</p>
<p>The studio announced the milestone through a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478">post on its official X account,</a> thanking the players who've already jumped into the new highly detailed life simulation.</p>
<p><em>"It's a number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you,</em>" the studio said in its post.</p>
<p>"<em>Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought inZOI to life in ways we could have never imagined. From the very beginning, you've been shaping inZOI with us, and we're deeply grateful for the passion and love you've poured into it. We'll continue working hard to bring that promise to life - where every life becomes a story in inZOI."</em></p>
<p>Right at launch, inZOI jumped to the top of Steam's leaderboards just <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-hits-1-on-steam-40-minutes-after-early-access-launch/">40 minutes</a> after the game went live. The game has clearly struck a chord with gamers who love a life-sim game and perhaps have been looking for a Sims alternative for a while, but the jury is still out if it'll have the legs to really challenge EA's long-running, genre-dominating series.</p>
<p>Krafton has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-sells-1-million-in-a-week-krafton-declares-it-a-long-term-franchise-ip">said</a> that it considers inZOI a&nbsp;<em>"long-term franchise IP,</em>" so at least for now, Krafton will continue to support it and try to make the new life-sim game a strong competitor to The Sims.</p>
<p>One key element to inZOI potentially having legs is that there's clearly a potential for the game to be involved in plenty of meme-able content and the odd scandal since inZOI Studios already had to patch out what the team said was an "<em>unintended bug</em>," that let players <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">run over and kill little children</a>. Players quickly turned to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-hitting-kids-with-cars-was-patched-out-inzoi-players-are-now-kidnapping-babies/">kidnapping babies</a> instead.</p>

The studio known for single-player dark fantasy epics like <em>Elden Ring </em>and the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is now working on two multiplayer games.</p><div><blockquote><div><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring </em>was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">three</a>-<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">part</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">interview</a> also goes into much further detail on <em>The Duskbloods</em> than we saw in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct teaser. The new game certainly looks <em>Bloodborne</em>-adjacent, but its multiplayer format is a significant departure. It also differs quite a bit from the other upcoming FromSoft multiplayer game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> — which is directed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">Junya Ishizaki</a> and due out in late-May. Where <em>Nightreign </em>is a fully co-operative players vs enemies (PvE) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">battle royale experience</a>, <em>Duskbloods </em>supports up to eight players in a PvPvE format.</p><p>Players will be able to choose from over a dozen characters, called “Bloodsworn.” They’re vampiric protagonists with superhuman abilities like super-jumps and double-jumps thanks to their consumption of special blood. Miyazaki noted, “As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.” It sounds similar to the class-based system of<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, but Miyazaki mentions the characters “can be customized to a certain extent.” (Fashion Souls fans, rejoice.)</p><p>Bloodsworn will compete for “first blood” across various maps with gothic and Victorian settings and vibes. Rounds will have varying objectives, with the de facto last player standing format sometimes tasking players to instead work together to take down a notable boss. But the emphasis isn’t solely on challenging combat, as players can earn “victory points” based from non-combat objectives as well. That may help those for whom PvP isn’t exactly their style — as Miyazaki confesses, “That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.”</p><p>What may also appeal to the single-player crowd typical of FromSoftware’s fanbase is <em>The Duskbloods</em> will have its own dashes of deep-seeded lore that in some ways may connect to other <em>Souls</em> titles. For example, the winged rat at the end of the trailer is actually an “elderly gentleman” who “shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series” and will be an NPC players can seek advice from in the hub world.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> may have swerved some of us by looking the part of <em>Bloodborne </em>but turning out to be Switch 2-exclusive multiplayer battler, but personally I’m all for FromSoftware experimenting with different ideas. We’ll get a sampling of the studio’s multiplayer ambitions next month, when <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> launches May 30th, while Miyazaki has much more time to cook with <em>The Duskbloods </em>until it comes out in 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Incredibly powerful Ultimates like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368">Cloak and Dagger’s</a></span> got significantly nerfed in particular. Because of this, a “dive” meta has emerged, with tanks like Captain America, Venom, and Thing and attackers like Spider-Man and others attacking enemy healers much more successfully. </p><p>Dr. Strange and Hulk have fallen off a bit, since they both got their maximum health reduced (and melee heroes like The Thing punch straight through Strange’s shield), so <strong>Magneto, Thing, and Groot are more prevalent</strong>. With dive characters being more powerful, anti-dive characters like Namor and even Peni Parker (particularly in triple-Vanguard teams) are seeing more play. </p><figure id="" data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now let’s talk about a few specific character balance changes.</p><h2 id="h302"><a id="torch"></a>Human Torch changes</h2><p><strong>Human Torch’s primary attack now travels faster and has two more projectiles, making him better at taking out single targets, particularly at close range</strong> (such as after his ground slam ability). His Ultimate is now more expensive and takes longer to charge, but it does more damage, meaning it’s a bigger threat than before.</p><h2 id="h303"><a id="ironman"></a>Iron Man changes</h2><p>Iron Man got buffed in several ways, but took a few nerfs too.. His single target go-to ability “Uni-beam” got buffed, dealing more damage. When he is teamed up with Hulk, it still boosts the damage further, but not by nearly as much, making the Gamma Team-Up less necessary for him to do his best work. He also had his Repulsor Blast (primary attack) damage reduced when hitting enemies directly, but the spell field (splash) damage increased, meaning <strong>he’ll be better at taking out groups of enemies but worse at single target damage</strong>. This creates clear use cases for Uni-beam and Repulsor Blast, so make sure you are getting close and using Uni-beam when taking out single targets and major threats, and Repulsor Blast against grouped up enemies.</p><h2 id="h304"><a id="cloakdagger"></a>Cloak &amp; Dagger changes</h2><p>Unlike the changes to Iron Man, <strong>Cloak and Dagger’s changes made their heals more effective with direct hits</strong>, with Dagger’s healing Lightforce Dagger doing 16 healing, up from 10. The spell field healing went down from 18 to 16, meaning she won’t do as much healing to surrounding allies. This means she’s better at healing single targets, which is something she suffered more at before. Invisible Woman, Luna, and Loki still do better single target healing, but this helps bridge the gap a bit. </p><hr><p>Naturally, we expect things to change up a bit once Season Two arrives next week. For now, if you’re looking to get some hours in with the current meta, these tips ought to prepare you for the state of the game as of early April, 2025. Now, if you don’t mind, me and my fellow Cloak &amp; Dagger players have to get back to fearing Magneto. Cheers!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – New Deus Ex Game Pitched By Eidos-Montreal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal.1155606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Duskbloods – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Rather than making a character from scratch, players will get to choose from over a dozen unique characters that have their "own identity and appearance," as well as unique weapons. Each character will have a weapon or tool to deal damage at a distance, as well the ability to summon an NPC to help them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Every Bloodsworn hero can also be customized. Miyazaki said characters can be "customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own." Customization comes in the form of altering each character's "blood history and fate," Miyazaki said, which will have an effect on character abilities, appearance, and even how they might interact with other players. Progression will come from playing matches and completing objectives, which can then be used to further upgrade and customize each Bloodsworn character.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what players are actually trying to do during a session of The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said players will be competing to complete objectives, obtain Victory Points, and be the last Bloodsworn standing. There will also be personal objectives or special events to complete that will grant various rewards. Players will have some control over these, as Miyazaki said players can assign a "Role" to their character that may see players rewarded for teaming up with or eliminating a specific target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big departure for From Software's usual RPG fare, but already sounds similar to the studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. The multiplayer Elden Ring spin-off also features a roster of hero-like characters to choose from, as players team up to survive and defeat bosses over the course of a match. From Software recently revealed a new playable hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Elden Ring: Nightreign, the bow-wielding Ironeye</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the multiplayer focus of both Nightreign and The Duskbloods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said From Software isn't giving up on single-player games</a>. He also said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-softwares-switch-2-exclusive-was-originally-pitched-for-the-original-switch/1100-6530618/" data-ref-id="1100-6530618">The Duskbloods originally started as a project for the first Nintendo Switch</a>, before revamping the game's development with the new Switch 2 hardware in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">The Switch 2 is still currently set to release on June 5</a>, though preorders in the US have now been delayed as a result of new US tariff policies that could result in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">price increase</a> or a delay.

Eremite Studios and Hooded Horse’s bestest best city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a> is getting a free update and a new paid expansion, featuring a new biome, mechanics and faction. Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty Warzone in 2025 has Verdansk, and the world is a better place for it. The best Meta Loadout in Warzone is the perfect combination of firepower, precision, and fun, and we’ve got it.</p>



<p>Warzone is partying like it’s 2020 again with the reintroduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. Players wanted it for years, the community pleaded, and Activision listened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Season 3</a> brought back the nuked and nullified map. Veterans are hopping back in, and newbies are jumping into the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> before getting the itch for full-scale, human-focused battle royale.</p>



<p>You need the right loadout once you’re ready for Normal and Ranked Warzone in Verdansk. I’m here to drop you our ultimate loadout. Forget multiple variations or options, as this is the best Warzone Meta loadout that should serve you well.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Tried and trusted. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We think the CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle is unbeatable and the best meta primary weapon to use in Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The AMAX has been a fan-favorite in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> before, and it’s still the same in 2025. Various trackers of Warzone gun data show the AMAX is the most-used gun and (debatably) the most powerful if you have the perfect loadout.</p>



<p>I know you’re here for it, so this is the optimal Warzone CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle Meta Loadout for Verdansk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>You might need to level up a bit to unlock these attachments, but rest assured, it’s worth it!</p>







<figure><figcaption>Good times are here again. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Our secondary weapon of choice is the HDR Sniper Rifle in CoD Warzone.</strong> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> is back, and Sniping feels back, and you can one-shot-down players if you’re accurate. The HDR has incredible range, damage, and mobility, and it gives you an option at longer distances. While you can go with something smaller and nimble to assist the AMAX, we feel the AMAX is perfectly viable at close and mid-range.</p>



<p>We want a long-range option, and a one-shot gun at any distance is a no-brainer, so here’s the best loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>We’ve gone with the Survivor, Quick Fix, and Ghost Perks for our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Survivor</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong> Ghost</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Survivor </strong>regenerates health quickly, and you revive allies faster. We think this is necessary for either solo or team-based play. We also need ways to survive and tank enemy damage, so Survivor gets the vote here.</p>



<p>For Perk 2, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> gets the nod, and it wasn’t a hard choice. This is another Perk based around health regeneration. Plus, it comes with the huge benefit of <strong>plating up with one hand</strong>—freeing you up.</p>



<p>Finally, the third slot goes to <strong>Ghost</strong>. It’s not quite as powerful as it was in the original Verdansk days, but we need it. As long as you’re on the move, you can’t be detected by UAVs or radar ping technology. Anything keeping us covert is fine by us.</p>







<p><strong><strong>Overkill is our Wildcard pick to equip a primary and secondary weapon.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The only other realistic contender is Gunfighter, but that’s being considerate to its feelings. If we’re being a cold-hearted killer like we want to be in Warzone, go with Overkill.</p>

Let us know in the comments, and leave feedback in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been rumblings about Nintendo eventually making its way to adding GameCube games to the library of classic games and consoles available through its Nintendo Switch Online subscription for <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-online-n64-datamine-more-games/">a while now</a>.</p>
<p>But that didn't make the reveal that it would actually be happening any less exciting when Nintendo confirmed it during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct on Wednesday. The catch here is that GameCube games are only going to be available to players subscribed to the higher-tier Nintendo Switch Online subscription, which is the NSO + Expansion Pack level, and that these games will be exclusively available to players on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>So even if you're already subscribed to the Expansion Pack tier, you'll need to run out and grab a Switch 2 if you want to play the classic GameCube games Nintendo is adding. And speaking of those games, as expected, Nintendo isn't just dumping all your favorites at once.</p>
<p>The games will be drip-fed as they have been with every other classic console added to the service, and when the console launches this coming June, only three games will be available on launch day. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</li>
<li>Soulcalibur II</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what will be coming later on, Nintendo did provide a quick preview during its Wednesday presentation. It was a quick scroll, but we know to expect another seven games, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure</li>
<li>Luigi's Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no word as to when these games will be added to the library of GameCube games, save for the confirmation during the Treehouse Live event on Thursday that they will arrive "<em>a bit later.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="GameChat &amp; Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEwM94z2oE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Nintendo has already hit some of the big names with this first batch of 10 games, there are still plenty that fans are waiting with bated breath to hear about, like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Super Mario Bros Melee, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, to name a few.</p>
<p>Also, now that we've reached GameCube games, it'll be interesting to see how Nintendo continues to evolve this classic library of games and game consoles. Will we actually get Nintendo Wii games added to this library? How far will Nintendo actually go now that we're solidly in the 2000s and getting closer to modern-day games?</p>
<p>There's a real discussion to be had now as to whether GameCube games are where Nintendo stops. Or maybe we just have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 3 before Nintendo Wii games are far enough behind to be added to this library of classic consoles and games.</p>

            <p>
City-building can be an exhausting affair, once you’ve evolved beyond the initial joy of cottage windows lighting up at night, and start having to deal with things like traffic congestion and rubbish collectors going on strike. As such, it’s nice to play a city builder in which you can rest easy in the knowledge that any urban sprawl you engineer will soon be obliterated. It’s even nicer that said city builder is free. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/before-the-ash">Before The Ash</a> is a hexagonal browser-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim created for the Godot Wild Jam 79 by Aviv Levy. Said game jam’s theme is “growing”. Another developer might have read the entry requirements and knocked out a game about watering daffodils or inflating kittens, but Levy’s thoughts gravitated instead to one of the most famous natural disasters in history. The city you are building in Before The Ash is Pompeii, the Roman burg that was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
</p>
<p>
Vesuvius is kind of your co-mayor in Before The Ash. It periodically spews flaming boulders that set terrain tiles alight, with blazes spreading until they encounter water. You can extinguish these with your mouse cursor to extract Faith from your populace, which is spent to acquire building cards. The deployment of said building cards, meanwhile, requires resources generated by existing buildings, such as stone and food.</p>
<p>The flaming boulders may also double as a means of clearing away structures you’d like to replace. After a few minutes of this, you'll wonder how you ever managed without a neighbouring volcano. Still, there’s only so long you can cosy up to ole Mister Vesuv. It’ll eventually blow its top and annihilate the map. Your job is to rack up the highest score possible before it does. 
</p>
<p>
If <em>I</em> were Pompeii’s ruler, and I had clear evidence of impending apocalypse, I would probably think about organising evacuations before I started making plans for new aqueducts. Still, I can’t deny that I enjoy the concept of collaborating with a volcano to tidy away some offensive fishing huts and gentrify the riverside. I’d love the developer to flesh out this idea some more.

          <p>Nintendo Switch 2 preorders, which were due to begin on April 9, are being delayed indefinitely amid the financial uncertainty surrounding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">Donald Trump's recent announcement of massive tariffs</a> on most US trading partners.</p>
<p>"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553133/pre-orders-delayed-trump-tariff">a statement cited by Polygon</a>. "Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged."</p>
<p>Nintendo announced launch details for the Switch 2 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">on Wednesday morning</a>, just hours before <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/tariffs-trump-news-04-02-25/index.html">Trump's afternoon "Liberation Day" press conference</a> announcing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-affect-countries-economy/">the biggest increase in import duties in modern US history</a>. Those taxes on practically all goods imported into the United States are set to officially go into effect on April 9, the same day Nintendo had planned to roll out Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">for qualified customers</a>.</p>

<p>The delay in the preorder date comes as outspoken gamers online are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jq5990/the_prices_for_the_nintendo_switch_2s_first_party/">making plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">noise</a> over the Switch 2's higher-than-expected $450 price point and over Switch 2 software pricing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">falling in the $70 to $80 range</a>. Nintendo's promotional "Treehouse" streams showing Switch 2 gameplay have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u">inundated with a nonstop torrent</a> of chatters demanding the company "DROP THE PRICE."</p>
<p>Yet today's announcement suggests that Nintendo might need to "assess" whether even a $450 price is feasible given the additional taxes the company will now have to pay to import systems manufactured in countries like China and Vietnam into the United States. Alternatively, Nintendo could eat the cost of any tariffs and sell its console hardware at a loss, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/why-nintendo-is-losing-money-on-each-wii-u-launch-unit/">as it has in the past</a>, in an attempt to make that money back in software sales.</p>

                <p>The first box-office numbers for A Minecraft Movie have arrived, with the Warner Bros. video game movie bringing in $10.55 million at the domestic box office for its Thursday previews.</p><p>For comparison, the video game movie Five Nights at Freddy's made $10.3 million in the US for its previews, while The Super Mario Bros.

For its part, Warner Bros. is penciling in a a more conservative projection of $65 million. Some estimates, Variety said, peg A Minecraft Movie at $90 million for its first weekend.</p><p>Another point of comparison is Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which made $60 million in the US for its opening weekend, going on to bring in $236 million stateside and $255 million from international markets for a total of $491 million globally.</p><p>Globally, box-office estimates suggest A Minecraft Movie could make as much as $150 million over its first weekend. The movie carried a production cost of $150 million, with many millions upon millions more spent on marketing. Despite those hefty costs, Variety said A Minecraft Movie is poised to become a financial success. This would be good news for Warner Bros., as the company's recent releases, Mickey 17 and The Alto Knights, failed to perform up to expectations.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Daniella Brooks, Sebastian Hansen, and Emmy Myers. It's directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess.</p><p>Like some of Hess' other movies, A Minecraft Movie is getting mixed reviews from critics.

			<p>Eidos Montreal doesn't seem to have given up entirely on the Deus Ex series and has reportedly pitched a new entry in the series to multiple publishers, sadly to no avail.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Insider Gaming</a> Weekly podcast, it was revealed that, following the cancellation of a new entry in the series, which came as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/">Embracer's restructuring</a>, the development studio started pitching a new Deus Ex game completely separate from the one that Embracer canceled to multiple publishers to see who would be interested in the game. Sadly, none of the publishers that have been contacted showed an interest, and one in particular said that the series is too niche to do anything with. As Eidos Montreal pitched the game to anyone in the market who would even listen to a game pitch, we shouldn't expect this game to see the light of day anytime soon, if ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As things stand, and with publishers being more averse than ever to taking risks, as highlighted by Tom Henderson in the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast above, it looks like Deus Ex Mankind Divided will remain the final entry in the series for a very long time. You can learn more about the game released back in 2016 in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deus-mankind-divided-review-totally-asked/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Could it be better? Most certainly, as pointed out in the review. But Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is already great as it is, and you would be remiss to leave it hanging in physical (or digital) stores if you care the slightest bit about RPGs with a deep story, lots of choices and a cyberpunk setting.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US owing to President Donald Trump's impending economic tariffs, and the company hasn't yet announced a new date on which you'll be able to pre-order the console.</p>

<p>Confirming the delay in a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ameSpot</a>, Nintendo media relations VP Eddie Garcia said the previously-announced pre-order date of April 9th would be pushed back "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>

<p>Garcia said Nintendo will "update timing at a later date", but that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> remains unchanged. It's unclear whether the My Nintendo Store pre-order date of May 8th will remain in place at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=6b8lUx8x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=Hxxo_cV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 have been delayed in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Garcia says Nintendo is looking to delay pre-orders due to "evolving market conditions" and that he specifically mentions the tariffs, a potential price change for the Switch 2 in the US isn't out of the realms of possibility.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $449.99 in the US, with that price rising to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>However, yesterday, US president Donald Trump introduced a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sweeping range of tariffs</a> aimed at various countries and economic bodies, including the European Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Other countries, like the UK, Australia, and Brazil, were hit with a baseline tariff of 10%.</p>

<p>Those tariffs will hit Nintendo in some of its key manufacturing centers, which will inevitably cause the company to raise its prices for consumers (since that's <a href="https://time.com/7274160/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-questions-answered-explainer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pretty much always</a> what ends up happening when it comes to tariffs).</p>




<p>Nintendo hasn't yet announced that it will delay pre-orders anywhere outside the US, but if you're in one of the countries that's been hardest hit by Trump's tariffs, you may wish to keep a close eye on things in the near future.</p>

<p>In case you missed the announcement, Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 earlier this week. It'll come complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">1080p screen, a 4K dock, and 120fps support</a> for some games, and it's launching on June 5th (a date which still appears to be intact around the world). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>A new report has revealed that Nintendo has acquired a third anti-Palworld patent, and a fourth one is almost about to be granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-secures-two-more-anti-palworld-u-s-patents-might-file-multi-patent-u-s-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-in-a-matter-of-months-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo now has three anti-Palworld patents—the first two mentioned in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier report</a>. The latest one, 12,246,255, was granted on March 11, 2025. It concerns smooth switching between flying and land traversal objects. Also, Nintendo’s request to interview the patent examiner was approved, and it seems a fourth patent will be granted soon.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patents-mean-for-pocketpair">What do Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patents Mean for Pocketpair</h2>



<p>Nintendo will soon have four anti-Palworld patents in the United States, which could mean a lawsuit could be filed against Pocketpair soon. The latest approved patent was initially filled in September 2022, but Nintendo has made amendments to it over the years, even after Palworld’s launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s interview with the USPTO examiner was successful. Out of the 23 patent claims, Nintendo has been able to add additional requirements to independent and dependent claims. It has dropped two claims and made limited changes to a claim. Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company have added a 24th claim, which talks about interacting with a character that a player either battles with or captures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GamesFray believes it is “fairly likely” that Nintendo and The Pokemon Company will file a patent infringement complaint in the US. However, it is not certain, and depending on how things go in Japan, there’s always a chance that the lawsuit will never come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pocketpair’s CEO came ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-ceo-under-attack-japan-pocketpair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under attack in Japan</a> every day’ when Palworld was released. Also, the game could be released on the Switch 2 if the console is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-on-switch-2-is-a-possibility-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beefy enough</a>’. What are your thoughts on Nintendo acquiring more anti-Palworld patents?

                <p>Following President Trump unveiling his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-tariffs-news-04-04-25/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial new tariff plan</a>, Nintendo has announced that it is delaying US preorders. Originally scheduled to start on April 9, a Nintendo representative has since confirmed this date has been pushed back indefinitely in order for the company to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." As such, it is likely we will see an sizeable increase in the console's price before it is relisted.</p><p>The full statement, which was given to GameSpot via a Nintendo spokesperson, can be found below:</p><p>"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged."</p><p>Nintendo's latest console has already been the subject of scrutiny--and more than a few<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-price-roasted-by-duolingo/1100-6530617/" data-ref-id="1100-6530617"> jokes</a>--due to its $450 price tag and the cost of its upcoming first-party titles. Following its reveal, Mario Kart World made headlines as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">Nintendo's priciest game</a> that doesn't include a physical accessory. And yet, it seems like prices will only go up from here.</p><p>For months now, experts have speculated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/#comments-block-33629463" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">President Trump's proposed tariffs</a> would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">significant ramifications</a> for the video game industry. Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> that Nintendo is likely to "feel the impact" of the <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907541343250878752" rel="nofollow ">tariffs on places like Vietnam and Japan</a>, where many Switch 2 units are produced. MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3lludkrrvmc2r" rel="nofollow ">FT</a> that Nintendo had already shipped more than 350,000 Switch 2 units to the USA back in January in an attempt to get ahead of the tariffs. It was also previously speculated by Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis that a Switch 2 "price increase in 2026 might be on the table" if tariffs persist.</p><p>Of course some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage Nintendo to produce Switch 2 units in the United States. However, Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p><p>During Trump's first presidency, tariffs did not apply to video game consoles because console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/">successfully lobbied the government for a special exception.</a> This time, however, it would appear we are seeing the consequences unfold.</p>

<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>According to Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own earlier this week</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>
<p>While as of today Switch 2 pre-orders have been delayed, Nintendo said the Switch 2 will still release on 5th June in the US, as originally planned. It remains possible retail prices for Switch 2 could change following the news regarding tariffs.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Walmart Gaming Canada's <a href="https://x.com/WalmartCAGaming/status/1908136995685032054">social media account</a> is still touting a 9th April date for pre-orders. </p>

		<p>For a certain cachet of gamers, the most exciting Nintendo game of this year doesn’t have karts or smash-happy apes in them, but space bounty hunters. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has been a long, long time coming, but it’s set to arrive as a key cross-gen game for both Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W9xes7BZto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our hands-on came with the Switch 2 Edition of the game, which will be available separately or as a paid upgrade from the base Switch version of the game.</p>


<p>That gives a number of enhancements, though, with the game able to push a 4K 60fps output or 1080p 120fps to TV (stepping down to 1080p60 and 720p120 when in handheld mode). It’s a real sign of the performance bump that the Switch 2 offers, and works in tandem with the refined visual style, scope and performance that Retro Studios is likely getting out of the original Switch.</p>
<p>We played through the opening stage of the game, as Samus descends to the planet’s surface and finds a bunch of Galactic Federation troops besieged by those dastardly Space Pirates once more. It’s an action-packed and combat-heavy opener, but still gives a little time to make use of Samus’ trademark morph ball mode and her scanning visor, both of which will feature much more heavily when digging into the broader game.</p>


<p>Of course, combat makes this an ideal slice of the game to test the different control options that Switch 2 offers. Just in terms of gamepad controls, we’ve come a long, long way since the original GameCube game and the Wii ports both having… atypical control schemes. This immediately feels like a more contemporary first-person shooter set-up, albeit with a lock-on feature using the left trigger instead of aim-down sights, but this also enables a free aim mode. Jump is also on the left bumper, while the right trigger and bumper are used for Samus’ standard beam and missiles.</p>
<p>Locking onto an enemy also enables a motion controller free aim mode, which will be great for boss battles. Lock onto them so that your strafing and dodging is kept relative to their movement, and then aim for their weak spots as they emerge.</p>
<p>It’s a good set up, but honestly, it pales in comparison to flipping the right Joy-Con 2 on its side and using <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> instead. So long as you’re playing with detached Joy-Con 2, you can do this at literally any time, the Switch 2 just knowing when the controller switches orientation and is on a surface, and entering mouse mode, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This just offers so much more natural precision, as PC gamers are well aware. Aiming is easier for keeping enemies in your crosshairs, and leading their movements across the screen – handy when firing slowish rockets their way – but you also still have enemy lock on and free aim when you are holding the left trigger.</p>
<p>It quickly became my preferred way to play through this hands-on session, skewing my senses in a way that made it difficult to go back to gamepad controls. This won’t be for everyone, though, and if you’re playing in handheld mode, with a Pro Controller or even with Joy-Con in their grip, there’s no mouse mode for you. I was also playing in an idealised table/desk setting, and while mouse mode can work great on your trouser legs or sofa arm, that’s less ideal, as anyone who’s living the PC TV life will tell you.</p>
<p>What we saw was just a brief glimpse from the game’s opening. The battles against Space Pirates were fun and it built up to a battle against a Metroid-infested boss, which trapped us in an arena and had us dodging energy waves, charge bolts and more while we targeted weak spots that it struggled to keep covered up.</p>

<p>The climactic moment came after defeating the boss, as more Space Pirates emerge alongside a rebel bounty hunter, blasting an artefact that lends Samus the psychic abilities that were teased in the gameplay reveal from last week. Those will have an integral role through the game, both for the environmental puzzling and the combat</p>
<p>For now, though, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is easily one of our most anticipated games for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s sure to be a great experience on the original Switch as well, but pushing the graphics to higher levels and the mouse mode are the cherry on top.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States won't begin on April 9th, as originally announced, to allow the company to evaluate the potential impact of tariffs in the country.</p>
<p>As reported on Bluesky by GameSpot Managing Editor Tamoor Hussain, Nintendo confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will not begin on April 9th in order to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." The console's release date is unchanged, so it will still be released on June 5th in the United States as it will in the rest of the world. Needless to say, this is extremely concerning, as the chance of a price increase has now skyrocketed.</p>

<p lang="en">Statement from Nintendo: Statement from Nintendo: Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</p>

<p>Even with a price higher than the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">$449.99</a>, will the Nintendo Switch 2 be a worthy purchase? Probably not for some, as Nathan found the console to be maybe too pricey even for $50, despite offering a significant improvement over its predecessor in every possible way, as he highlighted in his hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5th worldwide. We will keep you updated on the new US pre-order date and any changes in the system's price as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
