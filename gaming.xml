            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-town-name-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix will change the name of a town that's become rather unfortunate thanks to current events in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1825925882525151647" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on the Square Enix X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the town of Isis will have its name changed to Ibis in the remake. I'd imagine the reasons for this are fairly obvious, but just in case they're not, it's likely to avoid any accidental reference to the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/isis_fto.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">terrorist group of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-renames-town-called-isis-in-original-1988-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Automaton Media report notes</a>, the town of Isis is heavily inspired by Ancient Egypt in the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, and Isis is a major Egyptian goddess; she's probably one of the better-known deities in the Egyptian pantheon, alongside the likes of Osiris and Anubis.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-remake-isis-town-change.jpg?itok=64cwzDC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-remake-isis-town-change.jpg?itok=LPSPDjqd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3</em>'s Egyptian-inspired town will no longer be called Isis.</figcaption></figure><p>Automaton goes on to show its Ancient Egyptian mythology prowess by pointing out that the town's new name, Ibis, also links back not only to the mythology itself but also to the goddess Isis.</p>
<p>The ibis is an Egyptian bird that was "believed to be a manifestation" of the moon god Toth, and Toth helped none other than Isis when she was pregnant with Osiris' heir Horus in Egyptian mythology. Neat, huh?</p>
<p>Of course, the alteration is also a practical one, and the fact that just one single letter is different means that even if you did play the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, the change shouldn't feel too jarring for you.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, it is, believe it or not, a remake of the original 1988 JRPG, which is the third game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series. Shocking, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-throne-room.jpg?itok=M2_S1UVu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-throne-room.jpg?itok=Q2RAaneN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>will overhaul the original with new visuals and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will the game feature Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix">signature HD-2D art style</a>, also seen in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/triangle-strategy"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, but it'll also feature an improved UI, new animations, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9n80pq2dsbp1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on November 14th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-trailer-reveals-hide-seek-mode-coming-september-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z32r8ECNNiA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> released today, Forza Horizon 5 fans got a look at gameplay for the upcoming Hide &amp; Seek mode launching on September 10, 2024. </p>



<p>The announcement kicked off Xbox’s new Gamescom 2024 livestream. Today’s trailer confirms Hide &amp; Seek is a 5v1 game mode where one “Hider” must race to the finish line while five “Seekers” pursue them.</p>



<p>The Hide &amp; Seek mode will be available as a free update for online multiplayer gameplay. It features a ticking clock for Hiders to reach the finish line, as well as gauges for detection and progress. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hide and Seek - Gamescom Reveal Trailer | Forza Horizon 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z32r8ECNNiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The gauge features allow the Hider to play strategically, hiding “in plain sight” rather than simply trying to outrun opponents.</p>



<p>The new trailer also showcases in-game 4K footage of all the new mechanics. It reveals that the End Zone takes time to become active, and that there are Hider pings so that Seekers can plan and coordinate their efforts too.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games recently announced that Forza Horizon 4 would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-4-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delisted due to licensing issues</a>. It will go offline in December 2024, and as a result, Forza Horizon 4 beat a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-4-beats-all-time-player-peak-post-delisting-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new all-time player peak record</a> just a day later.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 first launched in 2021, and Hide &amp; Seek will be available on PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Game Pass.</p>

But one short flew under the radar — and it looks like it stars one of the most popular actors on earth.</p><p>The glimpse and you’ll miss it look at the Armored Core animation that’s a part of the Secret Level anthology series includes a snapshot of a character that looks a lot like The Matrix and John Wick star Keanu Reeves. Check it out:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/gvct3zywyaaj9v0-1724242265526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If that’s not Keanu Reeves, then I expect his agent will be on the phone to Amazon first thing in the morning demanding a royalty payment. Surely this is in fact Keanu Reeves — the face is instantly recognisable.</p><p>Reeves, of course, is no stranger to the world of video games. Most recently he starred in CD Projekt’s 2020 action RPG Cyberpunk 2077 as Johnny Silverhand. Now, in a surprise move, he’s turned his attention to FromSoftware’s Armored Core, which, while a popular series, is not considered one of the bigger video game franchises around. But then, there are other surprising entries on the Secret Level anthology list. No-one was expecting an animation for Unreal Tournament, for example, or Spelunky, but here we are.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Secret Level will have 15 episodes based on various video games. Here’s the list:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation Studios</li><li>Sifu</li><li>Warhammer 40,000</li><li>Unreal Tournament</li><li>New World: Aeternum</li><li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Pac-Man</li><li>Honor of Kings</li><li>Armored Core</li><li>Mega Man</li><li>Exodus</li><li>Spelunky</li><li>Crossfire</li><li>Concord</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Secret Level gamescom ONL 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A word on the Warhammer 40,000 animation: Games Workshop has confirmed it’s “inspired” by the upcoming video game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>, which is due out in September. It stars “Titus and the boys” in animated action, which is certainly something for Warhammer 40,000 fans to get excited about.</p><p>The 15-episode Secret Level series premieres December 10.

The LEGO Group has announced six sets will be released on January 1 featuring characters such as Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Toad.</p><p>While regular Super Mario LEGO has been available for a few years, this will be the first time the beloved kart racing franchise has enjoyed the same treatment. The six sets range in price from $14.99 to $79.99.</p><p>The sets are compatible with the main line of Mario LEGO too, as putting the Mario, Luigi, or Peach from those sets into each kart will prompt new sound and visual effects to emulate a race starting, horn honking, kart drifting, glider gliding, coin collecting, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart</h3></div></output><p>"With vibrant characters, customisable karts, and unique track items that will pave the way for endless play, these sets will get fans’ creative engines revving as they can turn unexpected surfaces into the ultimate Mario Kart track," LEGO said.</p><p>The cheapest option is the Yoshi Bike at $14.99, a 133 piece set featuring a little blue Yoshi riding a little green Yoshi Bike, one of the vehicles available in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Next up is the Standard Kart at $19.99 and 174 pieces, which comes with a Toad mechanic figure but not a main driver, and is therefore likely meant for the Mario figure from the mainline Super Mario LEGO sets.</p><p>Donkey Kong and DK Jumbo is $34.99 and comes with 387 pieces, Baby Mario versus Baby Luigi is $29.99 and comes with 390 pieces, and Toad's Garage is $39.99 and comes with 390 pieces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The biggest set is twice that price, coming in at $79.99 with 823 pieces. Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix is therefore the centre piece of the Mario Kart range, and comes with the start line and track markers alongside three racers: Baby Peach, Lemmy, and Toad.</p><p>Mario Kart sets were teased earlier in 2024 but have only been full revealed now. They're otherwise not particularly surprising, as LEGO and Nintendo are far from strangers with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-nintendo-sets">several collaborations preceding these</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-nintendo-entertainment-system-nes-officially-revealed">A brick-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System console was one of the larger sets</a>, while the Super Mario line has included myriad different products such as<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-luigi-starter-set-adds-co-op-to-lego-mario"> the Luigi Starter Set</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-dry-bowsers-castle-revealed">Dry Bowser's Castle</a>, and even a massive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bowser-lego-set-mario">2,807 piece Bowser set</a> that connects to the others. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-super-mario-64-playset-revealed">A Super Mario 64 set</a> was also released in 2021.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>A game narrator plays an important role, there is no doubt. Just look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler! This is a role that, indeed, also plays an integral part of the ongoing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> series, and famous names such as Leonard Nimoy and Sean Bean have lent their vocal talents to the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, Bean is passing on the narration sword - as it were - on to another Game of Thrones alum for the series' next instalment, Civilization 7.</p>
<p>As revealed in a new trailer, developer Firaxis has announced Gwendoline Christie (or, Brienne of Tarth to some) will be guiding us through the game on its release next year. "Now it's your turn to reimagine civilisation," Christie says in the trailer, "and build something you believe in."</p>

<p>Civilization 7 is set to release on 11th February 2025, across PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a> and Epic, PS4 and PS5, Xbox One and Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Our Chris has already been hands on with the upcoming strategy game. "Playing Civilization 7 feels, if not quite like donning an old pair of comfortable slippers, then at least a first try-on of a refreshed version from the same designers," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-pairs-seismic-changes-with-a-lovably-familiar-formula">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 preview</a>.</p>
<p>"A group of designers who know precisely what it was about the old pair that made them such well-worn favourites."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to a recent report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Tom Warren’s sources have claimed that Bethesda “has been targeting an April 2025 release for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5”. However, this release window might change depending on how the development goes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to PS5 have surfaced for some time. It surprised many when the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> a PS5 port for the title at Gamescom’s opening night live yesterday. As per the official announcement, the upcoming first-person adventure will be released on the PlayStation 5 in the Spring of 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, MachineGames provided some new information about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at Gamescom last night. There will be a bunch of puzzles for players to overcome, from “mysteriously locked chambers, complex ancient mechanisms, and ritualistic sequences of challenges to understand and solve.” Skill trees aren’t traditional; players must find ‘Skill Books’ worldwide to learn new skills.</p>

<p>Details about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s exploration were revealed, explaining how the game has a linear storyline and narrative-driven sequences. Still, players will also find much more open areas for exploration. Additional tools for Indy were revealed, too, along with The Whip. These include the Camera, Journal, Lighter and the Rest. The Rest refers to tools that players can find across the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus/news/2024/august/lego-super-mario-kart-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, LEGO officially announced that multiple new LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart sets will release on January 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The upcoming sets include Yoshi Bike, Standard Kart, Donkey Kong &amp; DK Jumbo, Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi, Toad’s Garage, and the Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix Set.</p>



<p>Today’s blog adds that fans can use separate LEGO Mario, Luigi, or Peach figures to the new sets for more interactive features. These include “audio and visual effects for race-starting, horn-honking, kart-drifting and gliding sounds from the game.”</p>



<p>It also reveals that “players can also use these characters to scan Item Boxes, allowing them to collect extra coins and help boost their score as they finish the race.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix will be the largest set with 823 pieces and a price tag of $79.99. The smallest set will be Yoshi Bike, featuring just 133 pieces and costing $14.99. So, there’s a decent range of options among the six sets.</p>



<p>LEGO Design Director Simon Kent teased sets that “provide an immersive building experience and capture the heart-pounding action of the beloved video game series.”</p>



<p>The upcoming Mario Kart-themed sets also arrive shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-world-shadow-the-hedgehog-sets-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Super Mario World set</a>, which will launch in October 2024. </p>



<p>In addition to LEGO Mario Kart sets, the new blog also teased three new LEGO Animal Crossing sets. Those include Stargazing with Celeste, Leif’s Caravan &amp; Garden Shop, and Able Sisters Clothing Shop.</p>

                <p>At Gamescom this week, Fable creator Peter Molyneux revealed his next game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-debuts-new-god-game-masters-of-albion/1100-6525994/" data-ref-id="1100-6525994">Masters of Albion</a>--and he now says it could be his last. In an interview, Molyneux said he expects to be in his late '60s when Masters of Albion is done, and if he were to make another game, he would be in his mid-70s.</p><p>Molyneux told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/masters-of-albion-is-peter-molyneuxs-final-shot-at-redemption-probably" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> he's not guaranteed to live that long. "My life expectancy is measured in days rather than years because of my lifestyle. I smoke and drink and don't sleep enough," he said. "So if this is going to be my last game, what should it be? And the first thing that occurred to me is that I wanted to go home. I wanted to come back to PC and console, and make a game for gamers."</p><p>Molyneux runs the independent studio 22cans, which created mobile games like The Trail and Godus. He said he "got disillusioned with mobile," in part because of how mobile game development requires developers to stick to a specific formula to make money, according to Molyneux.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last. I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard," he said.</p><p>In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Molyneux talked about how he's able to use Albion in his game, saying it's in reference to a historical term for Great Britain. It is not, as Molyneux sees it, owned by Microsoft via the Fable series.</p><p>"[It's] like saying if you set a game in America, you can't set any other game in America," he said. "So Albion can't be copyrighted. It's the name for England and Wales and that's how we get away with it."</p><p>Molyneux went on to say he honestly doesn't know if Albion can be trademarked. "I mean you would think that the responsible person I should be, I would've spent the last six months in lawyers' offices," he said.</p><p>Microsoft owns the Fable series, and the company previously granted the rights to Flaming Fowl Studios for its CCG Fable Fortune years ago (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-fortune-the-card-collecting-spin-off-of-the-/1100-6473416/" data-ref-id="1100-6473416">the game has since shut down</a>).</p><p>If there are legal consequences, that will come in time. For now, Molyneux said he's excited about Masters of Albion because it "extends and expands" the worlds he made in the Fable series.</p><p>"But it's not actually Fable 5 or anything like that," he said. "If you've played Fable, then definitely Masters of Albion will be familiar to you. One of the things that we have got and we absolutely wanted a nail was the humour. I think in the Fable games, it's not so much about telling jokes, it's more about giving you, the player, the ability to do ridiculous and funny things. And we've got that in Masters of Albion in absolute spades. I think we’re really nailing that."</p><p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/masters-of-albion/peter-molyneux-new-strategy-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Molyneux addressed his history of overpromising and underdelivering. He said he is "so, so, so sorry" about how he has "sold games by overpromising" and discussing features that didn't exist as if they did. "I apologize to anyone that got excited and got disappointed," he said.</p><p>"I'm really sincerely sorry to those people. I wasn't doing it because I had a plan. I was doing it out of ignorance really, and now I'm really obsessive about only talking about things I can show," he said.</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans also generated controversy over the game Curiosity: What's inside the Cube? The winner was promised a "life-changing" reward but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-god-who-peter-molyneux-forgot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ended up receiving nothing.</a></p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider animated series will be making its debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> later this year. The show is set to follow on from the events of the rebooted Survivor trilogy, which those who have played the games will know saw Lara Croft lose more than one friend (in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">Rhianna Pratchett admitted to me the first game in the series became a "cavalcade of death"</a>).</p>
<p>Now, speaking with <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-showrunner-tasha-huo-interview/">Nerdist</a>, the Tomb Raider series' showrunner Tasha Huo said Lara will deal with the resulting grief in the first season of The Legend of Lara Croft, so she can finally "start working on other shit".</p>

<p>"This series... really acts as a bridge between the origin story to the Lara that we fell in love with in the '90s, when we first started picking up the games," Huo told the publication. "That Lara was very quippy, very confident."</p>
<p>The showrunner therefore wanted to explore how Lara became that more self-assured version of the series' leading lady, and a TV show was a great medium to do just that. "I think what we got in the Survivor game series was so much humanity from her that was very moving to me as a player, and surprising given the colder Lara that we met in the original series," Huo said. "So for me, it was really cool to be able to explore the more vulnerable aspects of her while still maintaining the strong superhero figure that she is."</p>
<p>Huo furthered: "Lara has been burdened with grief since the '90s, but I feel like she's never fully gotten over it. And I wanted to move past it, to be honest, so that she could start working on other things, but it felt like we still had to address it."</p>
<p>"So in this first season, she is dealing with grief and we watch her power through to figure out how to become her best self after that so Lara can start working on other shit."</p>

            <p>Space can be a lot of things: beautiful, awe-inspiring, full of hope for mankind's future. But it can also be the setting for some truly spine-chilling horror - and that's what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s upcoming Shattered Space DLC will focus on. It places the base game's creepy House Va'ruun faction - a cult who worship a deity called the Great Serpent - centre stage. (Taking a wild guess, this is probably not going to be one for people who don't like big snakes.)</p>
<p>Shattered Space will see you travelling to the House Va'ruun's homeworld, which has been designed specially to tell the DLC's story. This means, if you decide to venture back out into the stars, you'll be able to return to the DLC whenever you like and pick up the storyline where you left off.</p>
<p>But where does the name Shattered Space come in? Well, as we found out during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> showfloor presentation this morning, if Starfield's main campaign is about the pursuit of knowledge, then Shattered Space is about the knowledge you should really shut away in a box and never touch.

<p>
  Upon arriving at Dazra, House Va'ruun's capital city, you'll discover that much of it has been lost to a vortex. Space has literally shattered, leaving the citizens searching for survivors and the minor houses who make up their society fighting for control. There's even worries that the Va'ruun Zealots are trying to use the chaos to re-establish their own house...</p>
<p>You'll quickly find yourself caught up in the politics of House Va'ruun. Yet, if you decide to journey across the planet, you'll discover that the vortex's effects aren't just confined to the city's borders. Creatures are emerging from the other side of the vortex and they're certainly not happy to be on an unfamiliar planet. Not to forget about the planet's terrain itself which includes gravity anomalies.</p>
<p>The vibes here are pure space horror - to an extent the base Starfield never really touched upon. And it's interesting, especially off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-gets-release-date">last night's look at the game's sporty new space buggy</a>, to see Bethesda trying different things. There, it was a pitch for the game to be a sort of space-set Forza-inspired off-road romp, with the REV-8 - Starfield's first land vehicle - now available for free. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield didn't land perfectly</a> - but perhaps it can become, as Skyrim has through its modding scene, a staging ground for all manner of other things. Including giant space snake horror. Shattered Space will be released on 30th September for PC and Xbox Series X/S.

<p>The new sets - which were announced at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> - feature some of Mario Kart's best-known characters: Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Toad, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and Baby Peach.</p>
<p>Lego Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures are not included and must be purchased separately.</p>
<p>The six sets feature a Yoshi Bike, a Standard Kart, Donkey Kong and DK Jumbo, Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi, and Toad's Garage, respectively. They range from 133 pieces to 390.</p>
<p>Baby Peach and the Grand Prix set is the biggest set, featuring 823 pieces so you can build your very own starting gate. It also includes Lemmy in the Landship kart and Toad on the standard bike.</p>
<p>Also announced at Gamescom were three new Lego Animal Crossing sets: Stargazing with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a>, Leif's Caravan and Garden Shop, and Able Sisters Clothing Shop. These sets will also go on sale from 1st January, 2025.</p>
<p>These are not the only Mario-flavoured Lego sets on the way, of course. Last month, Lego revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-yoshi-pixel-art-set-revealed">2D-style Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi</a>. The set will reportedly launch on 1st October and feature 1215 pieces.</p>
<p>The set is the latest entry into Lego's adult-orientated Super Mario range, following earlier impressive sets such as the fold-out ? Block and Bowser statue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has closed its investigation into Apple's in-app payment system "on the grounds of administrative priority".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66c5991067dbaeb97a13e513/Case_closure_statement.pdf">statement</a> posted to the gov.uk website, the CMA said it no longer considered the investigation a priority but stressed that the case's closure "does not constitute a decision by the CMA".</p>

<p>"The CMA will continue to monitor Apple's conduct in the market. Its decision to close the case on grounds of administrative priority does not prevent, pre-judge or fetter the CMA's ability, if appropriate, to open an investigation [...] in [the] future, or to take action in respect of the conduct considered as part of the investigation".</p>
<p>The statement comes over three years after the CMA commenced an investigation into the distribution of apps on iOS in the UK and a market study into "mobile ecosystems".</p>
<p>The final report, which was released in June 2022, "identified a number of potential harms from Apple's requirements on certain developers to use their proprietary payment system to process in-app purchases for digital content, which could be avoided if app developers were able to choose their own payments service providers and transact directly with users".</p>
<p>After assessing a continuation of the investigation, the CMA said as it generally prioritises cases by the strategic significance of its work, it was conscious that this is "a fast-moving area" and any enforcement under the UK's Competition Act would "potentially take a significant period of time". It also noted that it will soon also have the option to consider firms' conduct in digital markets under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act (DMCC) 2024, which would allow it to address issues "in a more timely, holistic, and flexible manner".</p>
<p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">said he has "no regrets"</a> over his company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">decision to break Apple and Google's terms of service back in August 2020</a> - something that saw the hugely popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> booted off both iPhone and Android storefronts.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-refers-apple-to-the-european-commission-after-dispute-over-button-design">Epic referred Apple to the European Commission</a> for rejecting its notarisation submission, alleging Apple's refusal is "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)".</p>
<p>The following day, Epic Games updated its statement to confirm that Apple has now accepted its submission, but did not reveal if it had rescinded its call for the European Commission to investigate its "concerns" at that time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Odyssey 3D is set for a global release “within this year” <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-groundbreaking-glasses-free-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-at-gamescom-2024">according to Samsung</a>, and will allow users to “seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D modes” based on preference — which may tempt folks who are curious about 3D gaming, but apprehensive to commit.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D is Samsung’s first 3D gaming monitor, having first <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/best-of/s/samsung-light-field-display.aspx">teased a concept display at CES</a> earlier this year. It’ll be available in 27- or 37-inch sizes and features a 4K QLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, alongside a 1-millisecond response time and support for AMD FreeSync. Both monitors also include a single DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.1 ports for connectivity, and a tilting, height-adjustable stand to ensure you can best position it to experience 3D content.</p><p>The glasses-free 3D is achieved by combining a lenticular lens — specialized hardware that can direct different images to each eye — with a built-in eye tracking camera, and view mapping to continuously adjust for depth perception. Acer uses a similar system in its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro">SpatialLabs laptops and monitors</a>. The resulting Stereoscopic 3D can only be viewed by one person at a time, but that’s hardly an issue for gamers, and my own experiences with the technology have left a good impression: it’s really fun to see things jumping out at you without having to wear special glasses.</p><p>One thing that’s missing is the price. We’ve reached out to Samsung to see if pricing information is available, but if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723345/acer-conceptd-7-spatiallabs-edition-laptop-features-specs-display-design">Acer’s products</a> (and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23757776/samsung-qd-oled-odyssey-g9-curved-gaming-monitor-price-release-date">historical pricing on Samsung’s Odyssey lineup</a>) are any indication, the Odyssey 3D offerings won’t come cheap.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for.959364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The first thing that jumped out to me as I began Monster Hunter Wilds’ introductory mission was how quickly I got invested in its story now that both my character and my Palico companion had voice acting of their own. The second thing, sadly, was how poorly this early preview build ran once I took control. Wilds is exceptionally exciting to me, recapturing what I love about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review">Monster Hunter World</a> while learning from the joy that came from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-review">Monster Hunter Rise</a>’s enhanced mobility, finding a balance of both that felt great across the handful of missions I tried. It’s unfortunate that its rough, in-development performance put a little bit of a damper on my demo time, but if Capcom can sort those issues out by launch next year, Wilds could be exactly what I was dreaming of from the next Monster Hunter.</p><p>What’s immediately clear is that Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out some of the traditionally rougher edges of this series. For instance, rideable monster mounts make a return after first being introduced as an automated option in World’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">Iceborne</a> expansion and then expanded into full control in Rise. This iteration leans more toward the latter, defaulting to follow a target but allowing you to take the reins directly anytime. Your dino-bird, called a Seikret, can scamper across special paths, glide, and give you time to use or collect items, which makes travel engaging in a way that feels less artificial than Rise’s Spiribird busywork.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But it’s not just a matter of convenience, as your mount also stores a second weapon option that you can swap to while riding. As a lifelong Insect Glaive main, this didn’t really appeal to me at first… until I realized that you can also use ranged weapons like Bowguns <em>while </em>mounted. That fully recontextualized this system, letting me pepper a retreating monster with bullets while my Seikret automatically chased it down, then swap back to my Glaive when it was time to hop off. I guess we’re all learning ranged weapons now, and I am very okay with that added flexibility.</p><p>I can only really speak to my experience with the Insect Glaive when it comes to how weapons have changed, but I was surprised by the adjustments I saw there – most of which seem to be in service of the new Focus Mode option that lets you more precisely aim your attacks at specific monster parts and special weak points. I found myself with a lot more options to sidestep or make micro-adjustments while attacking, with seemingly fewer combos that would end with a move that killed my momentum and more opportunities to really control how I was laying down the hurt. Again, I didn’t play enough to have the clearest sense of that shift just yet, but it feels like that Rise philosophy of speeding up some of the clunkier parts of combat is alive and well, even if you aren’t flying around on a Wirebug this time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out rough edges.</p></div><p>And if you’ll indulge some Glaive-specific gushing, there are two <em>massive</em> changes that radically changed the combat pattern I was used to. First, landing your aerial attack no longer bounces you back into the air for a chain of helicopter-blade slicing, which was admittedly a huge drag to discover. But the loss of that goofy fun is at least partly made up for by more convenience tweaks, as hitting a weak point with a special Focus Strike move will not only deal tons of damage, it also immediately collects all three Kinsect essences at once, massively speeding up that process in the mid-to-late part of a hunt. (Your aiming reticle now also has a helpful indicator that tells you which essence the monster part you are aiming will provide, and managing that system feels like less of a hassle all around.) </p><p>Even in my short playtime, I saw so many little examples of things like this – stuff that doesn’t undermine the challenge and deliberate pace that makes Monster Hunter what it is but <em>does </em>make the experience that much smoother. There’s a quick option to use whatever recovery items you have that will minimize waste, your hook can grab most items from afar (even while mounted), collecting at gathering points moves just a bit quicker, you can finally pick up bomb barrels after placing them, and firing an SOS flare will even fill your team with AI hunters if you’re offline or until real people online are able to join. It’s a laundry list of tweaks that aren’t necessarily revolutionary, but all make so much sense you wonder why it wasn’t like this before.</p><p>Of course, the big, buggy Gammoth in the room is how it all ran. I am willing to give Capcom the benefit of the doubt to a pretty substantial degree here given Wilds doesn’t even have a release date beyond “2025” yet – there is presumably a lot of time left to polish things up – but it’s still worth mentioning that this demo ran badly. Like, <em>really distractingly badly. </em>During busy moments, the framerate dropped to a degree that almost made it hard to play, and the group I was playing with saw multiple hard crashes. Again, this in-development build is by no means the final version of Wilds, but it is the version Capcom chose to show us, and I can’t help but be just a <em>touch </em>concerned that maybe that’s an indication that, at best, Wilds might drop later in 2025 than I was expecting, or at worst, that Capcom bit off a little more than it will ultimately be able to chew.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds gamescom ONL Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That’s partly because the ambitious scope here is truly impressive, seemingly hoping to keep hunters out in the field longer. Rather than kicking you back to town after a successful hunt, the second mission I did was structured more like Iceborne’s Guiding Lands, where you could stick around after to explore or immediately take on a new one, with world events and other dynamic things coming and going around you. Rather than starting from a single tent, there was even a surprisingly large outpost on the map I saw, complete with NPCs to talk to. I didn’t really get to see much of this side of Wilds in my demo, but it could add up to a very different feel between fights. </p><p>From what I did see, Wilds is shaping up to be pretty much what I hoped for: a Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry for me. It’s hard to tell exactly which way that needle will point after just a few missions (or if these structural changes will swing it somewhere else entirely), but I certainly can’t wait to play more so I can find out. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

However, Towerborne is now a ‘limited time exclusive on Steam,’ according to a new trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What that means is Towerborne begins Steam Early Access on September 10. In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/towerborne-why-early-access-and-a-focus-on-fun-means-a-better-game-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft said an Xbox Game Preview release will follow, with a full, now free-to-play launch planned for 2025. Towerborne will also include cross-progression, so your progress will carry over to whichever platform you prefer to play on.</p><p>Explaining the decision to go with an early access launch, game director Daniel McLaren pointed to the successful Kickstarter that got The Banner Saga off the ground.</p><p>“Stoic’s history has always been about interacting with our players, and Kickstarter is the promise of something,” McLaren said. “For Stoic, that worked out very well, and now we’re able to say hey, you don’t have to wait for us this time, we can give you a game right now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.</p></div><p>Microsoft said that as a result of the Steam early access launch, “Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.”</p><p>It’s fair to say the announcement of Towerborne Steam first launch and full launch in 2025 has sparked a vociferous discussion among Xbox fans. While some are saying they’re fine with the release strategy, others are pointing to the fact Microsoft has for years marketed Towerborne as a Microsoft-published Xbox game and now it’s set to launch on Steam first, disappointing yet again what’s left of the company’s core console audience.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/towerborne-1724236339356.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Towerborne.

While Microsoft executives continue to stress the importance of consoles to Xbox, and indeed have promised next-generation consoles and heavily teased an Xbox handheld for the future, the overall strategy is clear to see.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s director Hiroshi Takai has said it's "possible" and "probably even likely" that future series entries will launch day one on PC, rather than further down the road from their console counterparts.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/">GamesRadar+</a>, Takai spoke about Final Fantasy 16's upcoming PC debut, and the time between its arrival and the PS5 release. Final Fantasy 16 first released as a PlayStation console exclusive last year, with the PC version promised when it was ready.</p>
<p>"Naturally, we wanted to get the PC version into players' hands as quickly as we possibly could," Takai told the publication. "We don't get anything out of delaying its release either."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's much more we could have done to speed up the porting process," Takai continued, adding the time taken to get the PC version up to snuff was "time well spent".</p>
<p>When asked if future Final Fantasy games could perhaps see a day one PC release, Takai said: "I think it's possible - probably even likely." He did caveat this point though, saying "the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy", so this was "just [his] personal opinion".</p>
<p>The director went on to address some of the recent bumps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s PC ports have faced on release. You may recall, on its own PC debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was criticised for its performance</a>. Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it a "flawed, barebones release" that was "nowhere near good enough".</p>
<p>However, Takai said Square Enix "always listens to player feedback and bears it in mind".</p>
<p>"Since we want as many players as possible to enjoy our game, we made sure to address any points that could be perceived negatively," he said. "Of course, it's not just feedback from FF16 players that we listen to, but from other games, too."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 16 is set to arrive on PC next month, on 17th September. The game will arrive as a complete edition, including all DLC: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-first-dlc-opens-that-one-mysterious-door-and-its-characters-minds">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-finally-complete-though-its-dlc-wont-appease-critics">The Rising Tide</a>.

The announcement came via a teaser trailer, below, that on face value offers little insight into what to expect when the game launches in 2025. But eagle-eyed fans have spotted a number of secrets buried within the trailer itself, and Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford has said there are even more yet to be discovered.</p><p>“There are several secrets in the teaser for Borderlands 4,” Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826058021614793024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> following ONL. “Some I have not seen commented on yet. What have you found!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for Borderlands 4 follow.</em></p><p>Let’s start with what has been found. The most obvious secret is a snapshot of what very much looks like Borderlands villain Handsome Jack with the vault symbol covering his face. This heavily suggests Handsome Jack, the president of the Hyperion Corporation, returns for Borderlands 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-1724230300344.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this the return of Handsome Jack?</figcaption></figure></output><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Handsome Jack is returning for Borderlands 4. The vault symbol perfectly aligns. (Credit to @UndeadMD for the find) <a href="https://t.co/j2plLNACuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j2plLNACuk</a></p>— JoltzDude139 (@Joltzdude139) <a href="https://twitter.com/Joltzdude139/status/1826003824018075880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what else? There is eridian writing in the trailer. The Eridians are the ancient, presumably extinct alien race that serves as something of a mysterious force throughout the Borderlands series. Could the Eridians play a role on Borderlands 4?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/writing-1724230502972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>HE IS WATCHING.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/more-writing-1724230591197.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>BREAK FREE.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But what does the eridian writing say? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ex4p1i/comment/lj3ettm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor pskought</a> believes this is a substitution cipher, and the translation works out as “HE IS WATCHING” and “BREAK FREE.”</p><p>This is all very cool, but what does it mean? Fans have a number of theories, including that “HE IS WATCHING” alludes to the Watcher, an alien of Eridian origin that appears in 2014's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</a>. Some fans are currently speculating that The Watcher will end up as the antagonist of Borderlands 4, or at least a shadowy figure who is revealed to have been pulling the strings all along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-again-1724230409142.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this also Handsome Jack, or someone else?</figcaption></figure></output><p>Meanwhile, a mysterious orange face pops up at the end of the trailer which may be another look at Handsome Jack or someone else. Fans aren’t sure who this is, or who the robotic hand shown grabbing the face mask belongs to, but all these clues combined with Gearbox’s confirmation that Borderlands 4 is set on a brand new planet, suggest Borderlands 4 is certainly heading in something of a new direction. Perhaps a more serious tone this time around?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/hand-1724230753969.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who's this?</figcaption></figure></output><p>As Pitchford says, there are more hidden secrets players have yet to discover. Some may be little more than Easter eggs. X/Twitter user Primidian spotted what they think is an easy to miss look at Lilith crashing into Elpis, Pandora's moon and the main setting of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. We see Elpis in the trailer on a collision course with the new planet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lilith crashing into Elpis <a href="https://t.co/DTF5p1XKB4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DTF5p1XKB4</a></p>— Primidian (@Primidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Primidian/status/1826058172861428028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>What else do we know about Borderlands 4 at this point? It’s described as “the definitive looter shooter,” and we know it’s out at some point after March 2025 but before the end of 2025 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. Borderlands 3 and spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands were both timed Epic Games Store exclusives. Clearly, Borderlands 4 is not.</p><p>“See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight,” reads the official blurb.</p><p>We also know Borderlands 4, like previous games in the series but unlike the recently released Borderlands movie, contains “intense violence or gore, suggestive themes, strong language, and general mature content.”</p><p>There’s also word of cross-platform multiplayer, which would be an unsurprising first for the Borderlands series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Borderlands 4 Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here's more from publisher 2K:</p><blockquote>Borderlands 4 was announced at gamescom’s Opening Night Live with a teaser trailer providing players with their first tantalizing glimpse of an all-new planet. Borderlands 4 is the fourth mainline title and seventh overall entry in the franchise. Players will once again assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they search for secret alien treasure while blasting everything in sight.</blockquote><blockquote>“The team and I at Gearbox have a lot we’ve wanted to do with Borderlands since we first introduced the looter shooter genre to the world with our original game,” said Randy Pitchford, founder and President of the Gearbox Entertainment Company. “All of us at Gearbox have massive ambitions for Borderlands 4 and are putting everything we have into making everything we love about Borderlands better than ever before while taking the game to new levels in exciting new directions.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Borderlands franchise has sold-in more than 87 million copies to-date, receiving critical acclaim from reviewers and fans alike. With unforgettable characters, deep world building, and more unique guns than can be counted, the franchise has cemented itself as a must-play series.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re thrilled to be able to share with our fans that 2025 will mark a massive year for 2K and Gearbox Entertainment,” said 2K Core Games Senior Vice President and General Manager Catharina Lavers Mallet. “The Borderlands series is one of 2K’s most successful franchises ever and is beloved by millions globally. We’re excited that our already close partnership and collaboration with the Gearbox team has grown even deeper, and we look forward to delivering best-in-class experiences for both longtime fans and new players alike.”</blockquote><p>The reveal of Borderlands 4 is a long time coming, with Pitchford teasing it on a number of occasions in recent years. He told IGN in February that Gearbox was working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-teased-by-gearbox-founder-randy-pitchford"><u>the "greatest thing" it has ever done</u></a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Netease' free-to-play Overwatch wannabe comprised of superheroes from the Marvelverse, is set to launch on December 6th. And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's big middle finger to Overwatch isn't only that every hero is free-to-play immediately, but any heroes released later down the line will be too. On the one hand I think this is good because there's no barrier to trying out the new hotness. But on the other, I do think there was some merit to locking new heroes behind at least a bit of progression. Not like, spending real life money or anything, but just a sense that you've worked to unlock the new hotness. I don't know, I just found it quite exciting whenever I unlocked a new character with my hard earned Overwatch Bucks. And weirdly, it gave me a sense that I'd passed some basic tests: in mastering the simple free characters, I'd graduated to the more complex new release.</p>

<p>Captain America and the Winter Soldier are also joining the roster, which confuses me slightly as I thought they were one and the same. Then again, I am about as in tune with the Marvelverse as I am some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX38z_Ar9yI">The Voice's coaches performing Beautiful Day 12 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise yeah, my thoughts on Marvel Rivals are thus: I think this game is swinging around far too late. I wouldn't say hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> are dead, but I do believe Marvel Rivals' specific brand of shooter just isn't in demand anymore - even if it does look alright.</p>
<p>It might be DC or whatever, but I hope Square Enix one day gives us another Guardians Of The Galaxy adventure again. Now that game? That game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review">was good</a>.</p>
