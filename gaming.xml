            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-weekend-betas-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches in October, but players can get in early via a pair of open betas. Activision is running two of these beta periods during consecutive weekends, and the dates and times for each have been revealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is when you can jump into each beta:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers)</strong> - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT</p>

<p><strong>Weekend 2: Open Beta (for everyone)</strong> - September 6 at 10 a.m. PT to September 9 at 10 a.m. PT</p>

<p>Both betas are multiplayer only and will feature several online modes, weapons, equipment, and perks for players to tinker with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Set in 1991 during the Gulf War, the espionage-themed campaign centers on a mysterious organization's infiltration of the U.S. government. The Black Ops agents must go rogue to stop this threat, which takes players across the globe with new faces and returning favorites like Woods and Adler. You can learn more about the game by checking out our Summer Game Fest preview <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-%E2%80%93-polychromes-dennies-and-more.928530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/free-codes-for-zenless-zone-zero-polychromes-dennies-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been stuck in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/five-things-to-know-before-playing-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a> but lack resources, do not panic. Luckily, miHoYo has been kind enough to put out free codes that you can redeem in-game, which can help you get various rewards.</p>
<p>These rewards can help you get hands-on resources such as Polychrome, Dennies, and Investigator Logs, which are helpful if you want to progress in your game. Be warned, though. They have a limited amount of time for you to use them before they expire and will no longer give you rewards if you try to redeem them in Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
<h2>All Free Codes for Zenless Zone Zero</h2>
<ul>
<li>KANURBT5MQ8D - 40 Polychromes</li>
<li>USNC9SB4499R - 6 W-Engine Power Supply</li>
<li>NB6D9SB4MPSZ - 6 Crystallized Plating Agents</li>
<li>4BPDRBT459RH - 6000 Dennies</li>
<li>NS6U9TTLM6AV - 2 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>XTNDQAS44985 - 4 Official Investigator Logs</li>
<li>CATCHABOO - 30 Polychromes</li>
<li>ZENLESSGIFT - 50 Polychromes, 2 Official Investigator Logs, 3 W-Engine Power Supply, 1 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
<li>ZENLESSLAUNCH - 60 Polychromes and 6666 Dennies</li>
</ul>
<p>These codes can only be redeemed once per account, so you won't be able to get these rewards more than once if you try to redeem them multiple times.</p>
<h2>How to Redeem Codes in Zenless Zone Zero</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Due to the layout of the menus in the game, it may seem a little bit daunting trying to figure out how you are meant to redeem codes in Zenless Zone Zero. Don't panic; these steps will walk you through how to get your hands on those free resources.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, you need to reach Inter-Knot level 5. This is quickly done and can be done within the first couple of hours of the game or less.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the in-game menu in the left-hand corner by pressing ESC on PC, options on PlayStation 5, or tapping the button on mobile.</li>
<li>Select 'More.'</li>
<li>Select 'Redemption Code.'</li>
<li>Copy and paste the code into the available text box.</li>
<li>Select 'Redeem'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to other<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-link-psn-to-hoyoverse-id/"> HoYoverse games</a>, you won't need to unlock the mailbox function, as it will already be available as soon as you start playing Zenless Zone Zero. This is where your rewards will go once you have redeemed them.</p>
<p>You can also redeem the codes via the <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/redemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero website</a>. To do this, you must log in to your HoYoverse account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to the Zenless Zone Zero redemption website.</li>
<li>Select your server and character nickname.</li>
<li>Enter the redemption code into the text box.</li>
<li>Press 'Redeem.'</li>
<li>Check your in-game mailbox to get your freebies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most games that have access to redemption codes, they are due to expire. Some codes that were available for Zenless Zone Zero have already expired. They will be listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>NIJIZZZ</li>
<li>ZZZFREE100</li>
<li>ZZZTVCM</li>
<li>ZZZ2024</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will be updated as soon as new codes are released or as current codes expire so that you don't waste your time trying to get resources from an invalid code.</p>

This includes adding new dialogue in some scenes, adjusting animations, and even adding a few more smooches for some characters. Here’s the full rundown:</p><h2 id="h9373"><a id=""></a><strong>Wyll Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Patch 7 includes a heap of fixes for Wyll, ranging from improvements to his dialogue reactivity to fixes for romance scenes.</em></li><li><em>If you’ve experienced issues triggering the romance scene with Wyll, this update will fix that. Should your relationship be headed in that direction, the cutscene in question will now trigger when you speak to Wyll at camp before your Long Rest.</em></li><li><em>A bug that had been preventing his romance greeting from triggering has also been fixed, so players in Act III who have a stable, loving, and committed relationship with Wyll will now see his romance greeting triggering correctly.</em></li><li><em>We’ve fixed Wyll’s dialogue reactivity during the epilogue for partnered players who have either joined Karlach in the Hells or Lae’zel in the rebellion, and we also determined there simply weren’t enough opportunities to kiss Wyll during the epilogue. This update rectifies that with the option to ask for a kiss in more paths of Wyll’s epilogue dialogue.</em></li><li><em>And if you’re in holographic form during the epilogue, he’ll no longer automatically assume he’s talking to Lae’zel, which was weird.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h9374"><a id=""></a><strong>Astarion Highlights</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-recommend-id="image://ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-format="gif" data-width="700" data-height="389" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-recommend-id="image://ad141093b5035689cddb049dd13a1608" data-format="gif" data-width="700" data-height="389" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astarion kisses Tav." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>In Patch 7, we’ve made improvements to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the ascended Astarion.</em></li><li><em>We’ve also made tweaks to how Origin characters react within certain cutscenes, to enhance their emotional impact. For example, companions will show Astarion more empathy when he loses his ability to withstand sunlight.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h9375"><a id=""></a><strong>Lae’zel Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Lae’zel will now wait a little longer at her recruitment site if you tell her you’ll be returning. And once she’s set up at camp, she will also cycle through more varied idle animations.</em></li><li><em>This update will also put an end to an annoying issue where resurrecting Lae’zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, blocking you from leaving Act I.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h9376"><a id=""></a><strong>Karlach Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Along with some more general fixes for Karlach, she will now react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he has told her that he can help her.</em></li><li><em>That sketchy fade-to-black that follows her final scene in Avernus, which also unintentionally gave you a very brief glimpse of the region in gameplay mode, was a visual bug that has also been fixed.</em></li><li><em>The dialogue block caused by choosing to stay with a different companion the morning after your second romance scene with Karlach is no more.</em></li><li><em>Also, she’ll no longer brush the shaved side of her head during her camp idle animation. Wrong side, Karlach.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h9377"><a id=""></a><strong>Gale Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>With a few tweaks to camera angles and fixes to animation pops, repeated dialogue, and missing VFX, we’ve polished up Gale and his scenes and further refined his donation UI.</em></li><li><em>That panel that opens when donating magical items to Gale? This will now show all items eligible for donation - including those on your person, your party’s inventories, and your Traveller’s Chest.</em></li><li><em>This is part of the work that began with Hotfix #16 to improve the donation UI and update a player’s ability to access certain quest-related items, which has now been completed. We’re reinstating the intended behaviour that was removed in Hotfix #17 as a temporary bug fix to missing UI functionality. So if you now deny Gale a magic item three times in a row with magical items either on your person, your party’s inventories, or now from your Traveller’s Chest, he will leave your party.</em></li><li><em>Alternatively, selecting “I’m not giving you anything. Not now, not ever” will still cause Gale to leave your party forever.</em></li><li><em>We’ve also patched up a bug that was preventing the final dialogue between Gale and Mystra from triggering, as well as a scene in the endgame that would cut off before you could kiss.</em></li></ul><h2 id="h9378"><a id=""></a><strong>Shadowheart Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>In addition to fixing a few of her animation bugs, this update fixes a number of quest issues for Shadowheart.</em></li><li><em>A bug that saw the Spear of Night either not being received, or being spoken about as if it hadn’t already been acquired, is no more. Another bout of amnesia has also been fixed, in which Shadowheart occasionally thought Viconia was still alive after killing her. The ‘Daughter of Darkness’ quest should also now close properly if you choose to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia.</em></li><li><em>And yes, we’ve tweaked a few kissing scenes for her too, fixing a broken romance cutscene that should have triggered after giving Shadowheart the Idol of Shar, and a kissing animation that will no longer kick in before the dialogue option is chosen. We’ve also polished up the appearance of neck kissing. In the words of Michelangelo, no great work of art is ever finished, and so too is our approach to the art of snogging.</em></li></ul><p>Patch 7 is still two months away, but Larian says it’s not <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>'s final update, as the studio is looking to add crossplay multiplayer and a photo mode, which will all come as part of a later patch. All of these new changes sound great, but I will probably wait until the photo mode is added to go back because I’m a screenshot sicko.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bidding cracked $10,000 near the end of yesterday and $30,000 shortly after. “I am scared to see how much this goes for,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CDawgVA/status/1812938846801391721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CDawgVA/status/1812938846801391721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Colquhoun. </p><p>The auction then went viral when other streamers, including new CEO of FaZe Clan FaZe Banks and <em>CS:GO </em>streamer Amirfps313, got into a bidding war that pushed the price up to $500,000. “WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING,” wrote Colquhoun. “Wtf is going on,” Anys responded on Instagram. “The donations were capped so I don’t know if this is real or what.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the auction authenticates the bids, and thus how many of them are real vs. just other content creators clout-chasing off of the stunt. When I checked the Tiltify page this morning the high bids had all been wiped, but then came back a few minutes later. At the time of writing, the top bids were dominated by user “@haryvibes on X” and user “pls sex me poki.” </p><p>At least it’s all for a good cause. The auction ends on July 19. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When Gears of War: E-Day was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in June</a>, many fans wondered if it would be a console exclusive to Xbox or if a PlayStation release would also happen. Fast-forward a month later and a job posting is hinting at a possible release on Sony’s platform.</p>



<p>The Coalition is looking <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1729899/Senior-Online-Client-Engineer---Gears-of-War-%E2%80%93-The-Coalition">for a senior online client engineer</a> to work on Gears of War: E-Day. This position, according to the post, will “help build the multiplayer and online experience” of the game, including “in-game economies and commerce, session management, player statistics, user generated content, and matchmaking”. </p>



<p>As part of the preferred qualifications for the job, the listing mentions prior experience working with online platforms such as Xbox Live, Steam, and, yes, the PlayStation Network (PSN). </p>



<p>While having experience with PSN doesn’t necessarily confirm that a PlayStation launch of the game is guaranteed, it’s interesting enough that it was specifically mentioned. We know the game is certain for Xbox and Steam, which is why it makes sense to see it in the listing.</p>

                <p>If you're in the market for a new wireless gaming headset, there's good news: The console variants of Razer's flagship BlackShark V2 Pro headset are seeing a pretty hefty discount this week at Best Buy. Both the <a href="https://shop-links.co/1838999239400000010?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S BlackShark</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847980274346195567%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-headset-gets-big-discount-for-first-time-on-prime-day%2F1100-6524981%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 BlackShark</a> headsets are newer to the market and haven't seen any discounts previously, but both have had their prices slashed by $50 as part of Best Buy's sale to compete with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>.</p><p>The BlackShark V2 Pro headset has been around for a bit, but the console variants are fairly new and include a few additional features. Both support 2.4GHz wireless connections using a USB-C dongle that's included with the headsets, or with Bluetooth 5.2, and Razer says both can provide up to 70 hours of battery life. They also offer a detachable unidirectional microphone and use 50mm audio drivers. You can get them in either white or black.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827" data-ratio="0.82802547770701" data-width="1099" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4334827"></a><figcaption>Razer BlackShark V2 Pro for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4334827-razer.jpg"></figure><p>There are some key differences between the headsets, though. The Xbox version works with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile--but only supports Windows spatial audio on the Xbox systems, PC, Mac, and mobile, not the PlayStation consoles. Meanwhile, the PlayStation version works with PS5, PS4, PC, Mac, and mobile, but not the Xbox consoles. That headset also is compatible with the Sony's 3D spatial audio.</p><p>Whichever headset you're going for, though, the discount here is pretty significant. Best Buy is knocking $50 off the usual $200 price tag, bringing the cost of each headset down to $150.

                <p>For virtual reality fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a> is one of the best days of the year when it comes to upgrading your VR experience. You can't go wrong with the Meta Quest 3, and a solid set of earbuds helps to make that technology more immersive. Normally $80, the surprisingly versatile <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B87MQG2N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Soundcore VR P10 earbuds</a> are now on sale for <strong>$50</strong>.</p><p>These are officially licensed to work with Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets, but they're also compatible with PC, PlayStation, Switch, and other consoles capable of receiving a Bluetooth signal. This sadly rules out Xbox due to its proprietary tech for wireless headsets, but it still makes for a flexible set of earbuds overall.</p><p>For the tech specs, these wireless gaming earbuds use a 2.4GHz high-speed wireless connection, custom chipset, LC3 codec for fast audio transfer, and 11mm drivers to deliver some deep bass to your ears. It's worth mentioning that the 128GB Meta Quest 3 is currently $430 (normally $500) for Prime Day, and a few other accessories have been discounted as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publisher-announces-literal-cat-and-mouse-city-builder-whiskerwood.928485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-publisher-whiskerwood-city-builder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced brand new city builder&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>, which apparently didn't get the memo that "a game of cat and mouse" is supposed to be metaphorical.</p>
<p>Developed by Minakata Dynamics, whose work you'll know if you've played train strategy sim&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1355090/RAILGRADE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Railgrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>&nbsp;sees you constructing a home for a colony of industrious mice who are laboring under the "oppressive paw of their cat overlords".</p>
<p>Minakata Dynamics promises the ability to eventually decide whether you want to keep working under the cats' yoke or to "raise whiskers in defiance", so it sounds like you'll be able to lead some sort of rebellion against your feline masters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=ZFMhpdpP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-city.jpg?itok=bu345fhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is an actual cat-and-mouse city builder.</figcaption></figure><p>In gameplay terms, if you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/timberborn"><em>Timberborn</em></a>, then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Whiskerwood</em>.</p>
<p>The devs promise "complex simulations" and "supply chain management dealing with over 40 commodities", so if building the perfect logistical operation is something that presses your gaming buttons, this one's definitely for you.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, you'll also be able to build both upwards and downwards in order to "maximize space", leading to cities that ask you to build "up into the sky" and to burrow "deep underground". I suppose the latter, at least, is sort of in keeping with the rodent theme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=6GA0M_j6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whiskerwood-hooded-horse-gameplay.jpg?itok=QN9294NU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love logistics-based city builders, this one's for you.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll also come across other factions of mice, and it's up to you whether you want to try and befriend them or move straight to hostility to defend your settlement.</p>
<p>Of course, there'll be a tech tree to work your way through, as well as a "strategic layer to expand influence beyond the colony". In short, this sounds like another Hooded Horse hit, especially if you're into&nbsp;<em>Ghost of a Tale&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Redwall&nbsp;</em>novels.</p>
<p><em>Whiskerwood&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> "soon", although no release date has been announced yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For a big-name, highly anticipated, fully playable game to hit piracy sites <em>two months</em> before it’s due out, however, is astoundingly unusual. That’s what’s happened to <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, the Saber-made sequel to Relic’s 2011 hack-n-slash hit, apparently including all 75GB of the nearly finished game, and even server binaries.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195928,196251" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Originally reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>, the sequel—developed by <em>Evil Dead</em> and <em>World War Z</em> studio Saber Interactive—has leaked in a completely playable form. While there are reportedly some placeholder assets and missing bits and pieces, it’s said this unfinished build can be played online with other people. Absolutely horrific news for all involved.</p><p>People have been posting in-game footage of  the leaked game, although it looks as though publishers Focus are copyright striking it as fast as they can. However, a 47-minute Russian video I found shows the game running extremely smoothly, and looking extremely good. It has, if nothing else, got me hyped for the game’s official release.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076">Space Marine 2 Might End Up Being The Best Warhammer Game Ever</a></span></p><p>The original <em>Space Marine</em> was made by Relic, the studio behind <em>Company of Heroes </em>and <em>Homeworld. </em>In 2013, a sequel was in the works when the company became collateral damage in the miserable collapse of THQ. Almost a decade later, with the rights now in the hands of Focus Entertainment, the project was restarted by Saber in 2021, with footage first seen in 2022. By 2023 we learned of three-player co-op, and earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076"><em>Kotaku</em> suggested it could be “the best <em>Warhammer</em> game ever.”</a></span></p><p><em>Insider Gaming</em> says it believes the leaked <em>Space Marine 2 </em>build is from February 23 this year. This obviously means it’s going to be months behind what Saber intends to release on September 9.</p><p>It’s also worth adding that leaked builds found online are fantastically likely to contain all manner of malware, added by those looking to take advantage of the situation, let alone all those who will mis-label absolutely anything else with the name of the game to lure in the gullible, giving even further reason not to consider downloading the leak. </p><p>While this must be devastating for all involved, it’s possible to take solace in the knowledge that historically, major leaks can offer enormous extra promotion for a game (I bet you’d forgotten <em>Space Marine 2</em> was coming in a couple of months). And when they’re as incredible-looking as what’s appearing in footage, even provide guerrilla advertising. I’m <em>certainly</em> going to be playing the released version come September 9, having glimpsed how good this looks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on X</a>, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin revealed that Patch 1.2 is coming tomorrow, and also spoke about server updates for the game.</p>



<p>First, Rubin mentioned a server change designed to fix up matchmaking regions. In a series of replies to fan questions, they also elaborated on plans for future updates, including Patch 1.2. Rubin confirmed this new update will arrive sometime tomorrow.</p>



<p>One player asked about weapon updates “for nerfing and buffing different guns.” Rubin confirmed some are coming to XDefiant in Patch 1.2 tomorrow, and added “we have more coming in patch 1.3.” </p>



<p>They did not offer details about other changes coming to Patch 1.2. If some plans are already in place for 1.3, it might arrive sooner than later, but that is only speculation.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey all! We made a server change last night that may reduce the number of times you matchmake with a region that is not the one you are in. Let me know if you are still getting in games that are in a different region than your own. And if you do get a region that is not yours let…</p>— Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1813203749973991561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Another fan asked about a server select option, as a potential addition to last night’s server fixes.</p>



<p>Rubin stated “that is something we are looking at,” but did not confirm plans to do so. They clarified there is “no eta at this time to know if/when we would add that.”</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Rubin also addressed concerns <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over the Spiderbot issues</a>. Ubisoft only just released Season 1 and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corresponding patch notes</a> this month.  Season 1 features the new Capture the Flag mode, more factions and maps, and more.</p>

Its appeal lies in its blend of strategic depth and accessible gameplay, making it an obvious choice for game nights with people who don't devote their entire lives to the hobby.</p><p>Players draft colorful tiles representing Portuguese azulejos, which are ceramic tiles used in decorative art. There's a great tactile aspect to the game, which makes it fun to physically handle and place the tiles to create a mosaic of your own design. There's a certain satisfaction of watching your pattern unfold as you strategically place each tile. It's kinda hard to explain until you try it for yourself.</p><p>The game also has a mild competitive aspect to it. Players must carefully plan each move to maximize points while strategically denying opportunities to their opponents. There's something puzzle-like about picking your tiles while also throwing a wrench in the gears of your opponents' strategy.</p><p>Our reviewer, <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/mattdp">Matt Thrower</a>, said as much in his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">review of Azul</a>:</p><p>For more, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-board-game-deals-2024">best Prime Day board game deals</a> and the rest of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-sales-and-deals">Prime Day coverage</a>.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 16, 2024 1:23 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a delicious, delirious recipe–and one that composer Eli Rainsberry leaned into when concocting the tranquil, hazy score for Hollow Ponds' latest release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't Rainsberry's first rodeo. The IGF-nominated composer and sound artist previously cultivated the scores for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Saltsea Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Longer Home</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Monster's Expedition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For their latest opus, Rainsberry had to craft something both meditative and dynamic. A soundtrack that could embody the unpredictable verve of bird flight and the quiet serenity of a watercolor sunset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer over email, they explain there are two signature soundscapes that comprise </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> musical palette. One was ambient and spacious, and the other was more upbeat and vibrant. It's a combination partly inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spiritual prequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hohokum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but Rainsberry was keen to avoid creating an obvious pastiche.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The ambient side of things was one of the very first things I explored as part of the process of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> soundscape. I initially leant into more subtle, constant drones akin to the sort of works from Eno until we felt like we wanted to go more spacious, and letting things breathe where possible, ultimately aiming to figure out more of the sense of space, bedding the music more into the ambience," they explain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I regularly bounced off feedback with the creative leads (Ricky Haggett, Dick Hogg), plus our sound designer (Dan Pugsley) who I collaborated closely for some of the music design and implementation. This was the first project I was on with that kind of collaboration since I tend to act as audio lead on most of my other projects. But I was pleased that during a lot of the time on production, there was music that I was able to compose first passes on that made it into the game with not much feedback, and to have that trust built up already–especially from after working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> before with Ricky and Dick–meant a lot to me, there."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A deliberate use of space and silence">A deliberate use of space and silence</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In scoring for the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–a picturesque dreamscape filled with offbeat creatures–Rainsberry was adamant that players needed space. Their score should accentuate the landscape around players, not overshadow it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I scored to support the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I wanted to make sure that there was a lot of space made to allow folks to take a breath in hearing the distant calls of these creatures, the ambiences of the trees, grass and streams. I think there’s power in how you use silence or at least quiet interludes when arranging music in a space like this," they note.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For each area of the world, I used different sets of synthesised textures and pads that I felt resonated with each space or [...] liked how they sounded against certain melodies that’d play in those areas. The Lupin Fields, for example, would feel a little different to the Grasslands with some textural and melodic changes, making sure they had different sonic identities.&nbsp;I also had a set of instruments that were more acoustic–stringed and plucky to layer on top. Having day and night cycles in the game, only the acoustic layers would phase out during the night."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rainsberry felt that blending electronic elements with woodwinds and strings would help layer in texture. The organic and synthetic swirling together to create a sound that feels both familiar and distinct–much like the myriad of creatures players will encounter in on their travels across the Uplands. It also pushed them outside of their comfort zone, with Rainsberry previously leaning more heavily on "purely electronic" sounds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I wanted to revisit my approach to writing for woodwinds and strings. My use of woodwinds, where you'd hear flute, clarinet and saxophone lines in places, felt somewhat 'on the nose' [...] for a game that’s about riding through the winds of fields and grasslands. [So] I used these predominantly for the rarer creature chase tracks and stings, where I thought it’d be a neat way to give each rarer creature, such as the Emperor Cosmet, a support for its voice and calls. I found that there was something quite earthy about woodwinds generally that made me want to try using that palette of instruments a lot more," they add.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Finding the right balance for came from experimenting between those textures and instruments, with some prioritizing of certain melodic woodwinds and any little arpeggiated patterns I tend to make. I’m also a sucker for reverbs and experimenting with the different ways my presets get processed (Valhalla's Vintage Reverb has been a big favourite for me recently, though Logic’s own Space Designer I still use), so I sometimes use them on select acoustic instruments and EQ/low pass in a way that sounds more close to a synth pad with extra texture. [This] helps bring a little balance for tracks with less synth instruments."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Comedic beats and electronic suites">Comedic beats and electronic suites</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is unashamedly laid back, but it also has heart and humor in abundance. Capturing the latter proved particularly challenging for Rainsberry, who admits they struggle with writing more comedic beats. "It's finding the timings of certain bits, making some sounds a little goofy while still considering the world we're in," they say, outlining the task at hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are moments in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where players will need to capture Burgling Bewls, pesky little creatures that have smuggled away some very important whistles. Apprehending those cheeky Bewls and collecting whistles allows players to attract new creatures and bolster their flock. It's a core part of the gameplay loop, but scoring those moments of lighthearted victory proved difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I struggle with these sorts of things, I always defer back to listening and watching references from other media that I enjoy to see if anything would resonate with what I’m doing, and maybe suit the humor of what I want to go for more," says Rainsberry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As someone who’s really into their animation (support The Animation Guild as they prepare to strike in the future by the way), I tend to watch those more for inspiration, especially shows like Adventure Time. I always admired how far out and abstract the music would go [in Adventure Time] while still remaining really funny to me. Its music would also be frequently something I'd listen to for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Rainsberry decided to play around with sounds that some might perceive as too immature for game scores. It was a big swing, but one that helped capture the essence of those brazen Burgling Bewls. "I played around with instruments that’d typically be deemed as a little childish or goofy, some that’d pitch shift a little funny," they explain. "Xylophones can be cute and fun to create some little chromatic stings and riffs here and there. [...] For example, I synced some mouth pop-like sounds to when the Bewls steal those whistles during an early game cutscene."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing the more practical side of composition, Rainsberry explains the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> score relied heavily on a mix of instrument libraries such as Native Instruments' 'Massive' and 'Reaktor.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There was a fair bit of FM synthesis with NI's 'FM8' and u-He's 'Repro 5' too. Those two in particular were go-tos in terms of shaping that part of the sonic soundscape," they say. "Repro's instruments were great because I was able to tag and assign them as favourites to use for specific projects. I had a few to pick and expand on for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> especially, so they helped support some of my workflow that way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The other acoustic and woodwind instruments I used included Westwood Instruments' 'Untamed' suite, where the instruments recorded were more improvised and expressive. The higher the velocity raises, the more chaotic they get. That being said, I quite liked having them at a medium to low velocity since they still brought out breathy, murmured textures that I felt rested well against the synth pads I built up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite their penchant for electronica, Rainsberry says they're a guitarist at heart and explains some of their acoustic recordings can be heard in tracks like 'To the Hilltop' and 'The Water Towers.' They also created sonic sketches on keyboard during production to help turn raw concepts into more tangible ideas. All of those building blocks were then assembled in Logic Pro, which Rainsberry explains "has always been how I've composed and arranged."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Logic Pro] has always supported my workflow generally by letting me build a library of presets for each project," they continue. "I can just select them and either use them or work something else out from there. Part of the process for me generally is layering up different sounds, textures, and harmonies and hearing what works and compliments each other–it takes a bit of time and I feel like so much of my ‘writing’ is trialling and erroring different combinations of them, but I think it’s worth it for me in the long run, especially when it comes to the mixing and mastering stages."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They suggest their approach to mixing and mastering is still a work-in-progress, and says that with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they tried Match EQing as close as possible to a handful of reference tracks.&nbsp;We suspect it's a sentiment most creative types can relate too. Perfection is always situated just beyond the veil, but in the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">blissfully understated yet soaring score, we think Rainsberry has come as close as you could probably get.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://elirainsberry.bandcamp.com/album/flock-ost">You can listen to Rainsberry's Flock score on Bandcamp</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>The previous Game Pass wave of July 2024 titles offered several more options, including Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. But fans often appreciate day one releases, and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a particular highlight.</p>



<p>Capcom recently teased Kunitsu-Gami during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-next-showcase-announced-for-july-1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom Next Showcase event</a>. It showed off gameplay, cinematics, and announced a collaboration with Okami. The crossover will be a free title update for purchasers and available on release day. </p>



<p>Fans who pre-order Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess can also gain access to special equipment and a mini artbook. The action strategy game will be available on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p>



<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a soulslike from A44 Games, and Dungeons of Hinterberg is a fantasy adventure from Microbird Games.</p>

The least-expensive Xbox out there is the $300 Xbox Series S, so the ability to take advantage of this Prime Day deal might be attractive to a number of people. Microsoft has always said it does not expect cloud gaming to overtake or replace the traditional hardware-based model, and to that end, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/" data-ref-id="1100-6523373">Microsoft is cooking up a new Xbox device now.</a></p><p>Microsoft itself at one point was thinking about creating its own streaming-focused Xbox device of some type, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-the-xbox-streaming-console-isnt-ready-yet/1100-6509207/" data-ref-id="1100-6509207">Microsoft's R&amp;D teams couldn't get its components' price down low enough for it to make sense as a commercial product.</a> So instead, Microsoft is working with companies like Amazon and Samsung to help expand Xbox's footprint in the streaming space.</p><p>Whereas Microsoft used to spend a lot of time, money, and attention on trying to convince people to buy new Xbox hardware, that isn't the company's sole focus any longer. The wider goal, it seems, is to expand the Xbox ecosystem to as many people as possible, and to convince them to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F10%2F25%2F23423668%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-20-million-people-streamed&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-cloud-gaming-now-works-on-4k-fire-tv-sticks-which-are-up-to-50-off-at-amazon%2F1100-6524775%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721136586642ghd" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">More than 20 million</a> people have already used Xbox cloud gaming, and that figure no doubt stands to grow bigger still in the months and years to come.</p>

However, any mention has now been scrubbed, with the service only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. GTA+ coming to Switch would be somewhat surprising, since one of its main benefits is extras for GTA Online--which is part of GTA V, a game not available on Nintendo's system.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via both a cinematic trailer introducing its world and an extended gameplay trailer that demonstrates how it'll play. It turns out the answer to that second conundrum is "quite a lot like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, by the looks of things".</p>
<p>This one's got a distinctly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>-style urban fantasy setting as well, and it revolves around a group of characters investigating Anomalies in the land of Helthereau.</p>

<p>You can also see some combat, which looks fairly similar to HoYoverse's style; you'll be switching quickly between characters to build combos, and it looks like each character will have special abilities to take advantage of as well.</p>
<p>Rather unusually for an anime-style gacha game, you can also see characters floating down to street level from rooftops,&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Knight&nbsp;</em>style, before hopping into cars to explore the rain-soaked streets of the city at night.</p>
<p>Here's the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness</em>.</p>

<p>If that trailer has piqued your interest, then I'd suggest checking out this 13-minute gameplay trailer as well, which shows off a wide range of different activities in&nbsp;<em>NTE</em>.</p>

<p>Both trailers conclude with a teaser for something more in September, so it sounds like we might get a release window - or, at least, a beta window - then.

			<div>
								<p><span>Back</span>  in 2005, a small firm offered a tantalizing vision of the future of computer keyboards.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>What if your keyboard was filled with tiny screens that showed you exactly what any given press would do, each built into a crystal-clear key? The keys would morph and shift as you needed, transforming from letters and numbers to full-color icons and app shortcuts, depending on what you were doing.
</p>


								<p>Readers and tech bloggers adored the idea. “It’s about time someone shook up this stagnant keyboard market,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050729090327/http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000740050460/">declared <em>Engadget</em></a>. “The concept is fantastic,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050829024522/http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/input/index.php">wrote <em>Gizmodo</em></a>. <em>Slashdot </em><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/05/07/14/1335215/optimus-keyboard-with-oled-display-keys">lit up</a>.
</p>


								<p>The keyboard was just a concept, dreamed up by Art Lebedev, a Russian design firm, and it was an ambitious idea at that: called the Optimus Maximus, it would require over 100 built-in screens using display technology that wasn’t readily available at the time. With all the excitement, the firm decided to make it real.
</p>

		</p>
</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>The journey to create the Optimus Maximus would take years and end in multiple commercial failures. But Art Lebedev’s vision and the technology created along the way would live on and ultimately find widespread success —&nbsp;a success that’s been hidden inside another popular product: Elgato’s Stream Deck, a small desktop accessory covered in morphing, full-color keys.
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato came to release its first Stream Deck in 2017, Art Lebedev’s Optimus keyboards had faded into history. But there’s more linking the two devices than a core idea. In fact, the Stream Deck hardware came from precisely the same company that developed the Optimus Maximus’ keys. In a very real sense, Art Lebedev’s work laid the foundations for what Elgato would go on to create.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>In</span>  2010, Elgato was in “crisis mode.”&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>For around a decade, the German video capture company had been selling its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTV">TV tuners</a> to people who wanted to watch and record live television via a connected computer. But by 2010, it was clear that the market for such devices was disappearing fast. On one side, broadcast TV was becoming increasingly encrypted, limiting what Elgato’s devices could do. On the other, the streaming revolution, led by Netflix and YouTube, was cutting out the humble TV tuner entirely.
</p>


								<p>“You’re on a sinking ship, you’ve got to figure out what you’re going to do,” recalls Elgato’s Julian Fest, whose parents originally founded the company in 1999.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato started to take a hard look at its business, and it noticed one number that didn’t quite make sense.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Elgato knew how many TV tuners it had sold, but people had been registering far more copies of the company’s EyeTV recording software than its own customers would need. When it emailed those customers, it found out they were using a <em>rival</em> piece of hardware, the Hauppauge HD-PVR — and not to record broadcast TV. They were recording gameplay from their PlayStations to put up on YouTube. Right under Elgato’s nose was a new market opportunity.
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>The market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Armed with over a decade’s worth of video encoding knowledge from its TV tuner days, a direct connection to Hauppauge’s customers, and Hauppauge’s own quarterly earnings reports to know just how many HD-PVRs it sold, Elgato decided to release a rival capture product specifically tailored to gamers. The result was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/21/3034372/elgato-game-capture-hd-xbox-360-ps3-recording-announced">Game Capture HD</a>, released in 2012.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Three years later, when Fest took over as Elgato’s general manager, it seemed clear that the market for online gameplay videos was poised to explode. With Amazon acquiring the live streaming service Twitch for almost $1 billion in 2014, Fest was on the lookout for ways Elgato could double down. Perhaps it could offer a way to not just capture gameplay footage but also to help Twitch streamers control their broadcasts in the moment.
</p>


								<p>“If you looked at the state of Twitch and live streaming at the end of 2015, it was intriguing, but it was also kind of boring,” Fest tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Everybody’s stream was like, ‘Here’s my gameplay, here’s my webcam,’ and that’s it.” He figured that simplicity was because of all the different jobs a streamer has to handle during broadcasts: between playing the game, reading the chat, and entertaining an audience, it’d be difficult to <em>also</em> run a dynamic broadcast filled with changing layouts and eye-catching transitions.
</p>


								<p>Unless, Fest thought, there was a way to offer advanced broadcast controls without distracting a streamer from other tasks. The company found its answer in a <a href="https://youtu.be/oFqiNWyBnAo">popular German TV show</a> where the host had a so-called “nipple board” of buttons in front of him, built into a giant desk. “Every time you pressed one of these buttons, it would play a funny clip that his team had found on TV,” Fest recalls. The team wondered if Elgato could use a similar array of buttons to control a livestream.
</p>


								<p>Elgato had its idea — now, it needed to find the right buttons to make it a reality.&nbsp;
</p>


							

			</div>
			<div>
								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev had never intended to make a massive splash in the keyboard business. Timur Burbaev, who served as the keyboard’s industrial designer, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the initial idea came about shortly after he joined in 2003. The keyboard was just meant to be a concept, similar to its <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/lavatrix/">Lavatrix washing machine</a>, to show off the studio’s design chops and drum up more business in the free time between projects.
</p>


								<p>In July 2005, the company released a <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/concept/">series of concept images</a> of what it called the “Optimus keyboard.” It had the same basic layout as a full-size computer keyboard but with a twist: “Every key of the Optimus keyboard is a stand-alone display showing exactly what it is controlling at this very moment,” the website still reads. 
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>A decade before the Stream Deck, the Art Lebedev Optimus keyboard convincingly imagined screens beneath keys.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The vision was an entire keyboard that could visibly change each key’s function to match your chosen app.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>The concept called for 123 individual OLED screens; the final Optimus Maximus shipped with 113.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				
				<p><span>Even today, these renders look surprisingly real thanks to the pixelated imperfections visible in each key.</span>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>One image shows how the keys could change to show an array of Photoshop tools; another shows dedicated controls for <em>Quake.</em> (This was 2005, after all.) On the left edge of the keyboard are macro keys that can be programmed to open specific programs, illustrated with a series of delightfully 2005-era logos like Internet Explorer and QuickTime. Although the images are renders rather than real photographs, the close-ups make an effort to show individual pixels present on the screens of the keys, a small imperfection that provides a tantalizing hint of reality. Nearly two decades later, the imaginary device still looks fantastic.
</p>


								<p>It was hard to ignore the amount of interest the design was getting. The team called an emergency meeting to discuss. “Back then, we just realized that if you get such a positive response, then let’s risk it and just produce it,” Burbaev says. It was “a clear indication” that the team should try and make it for real. The long and difficult journey of producing what would become the Optimus Maximus had begun. “No one imagined how much time and energy and especially investment it would take,” Burbaev says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>A big early decision was working out what kind of screen technology to use. The first iPod with a color display had only just been released, and the iPhone had yet to make its debut. Candybar-style phones like the Nokia 1110 and Motorola C139 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_mobile_phones">reigned supreme</a>. Art Lebedev thought LCD screens of the era were too dim and offered terrible black levels, while E Ink screens had terrible response times and no backlighting at all. OLED seemed like the best choice.
</p>


								<p>But this was long before OLED displays were routinely shipping in mainstream smartwatches, smartphones, and TVs. “The problem with OLED displays was that you could potentially find such a small OLED display in 2006 but a) it would cost you a fortune and b) it would have a massive resolution,” Burbaev says. They were meant for military users to show tactical information like maps on tiny screens, not <em>Quake</em> icons on a keyboard. 
</p>


			</div>
				<p><span>“Finally we realized there is no other option than to make our own matrix for the display.” - Timur Burbaev</span>
</p>
			<div>
								<p>Art Lebedev decided its “only option” was to dive headfirst into the OLED display business. Burbaev believes his was one of the first companies to ship a product with these kinds of small, low-cost, low-resolution OLED screens. Doing so involved placing what Burbaev describes as a “very strange” order with a Taiwanese manufacturer with some prior experience. He adds that two managers from Art Lebedev ended up living in Taiwan for half a year while they were being made.
</p>


								<p>Not only did Art Lebedev need to find screens small enough to fit under each of its keys but it also needed to find a way for them to coexist with keys that you could actually type on. The final keyboard ended up being a bit of a fudge: the screens didn’t actually move. Instead, the company built a moving plastic keycap that moved <em>around</em> each screen. But even this solution had its challenges, Burbaev says. This plastic keycap needed to not only be transparent enough to show the display but also tinted enough to not reveal the ugly inner mechanism of each screen and durable enough to withstand scratches.
</p>


								<p>All of this meant the development process for the Optimus Maximus was long and difficult, and <em>Wired </em>featured the keyboard not <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/12/vaporware-06-return-of-the-king/">once</a> but <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/01/ye-vaporware/?slide=7&amp;slideView=2">twice</a> in its annual vaporware roundups. Art Lebedev was unusually open about the troubled development process, cataloging its progress making the keyboard <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/">on a LiveJournal blog</a>. We’re used to receiving such updates in an era of Kickstarter and crowdfunding, but the approach felt novel at the time — and it shows just how slowly development went. It took months just to arrive on a keycap design, <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/3161.html">studying various possibilities</a> along the way. The company’s first OLED manufacturer <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/25029.html">went bust</a> before managing to deliver its pricy $10 keys, forcing Art Lebedev to hunt down a new Taiwanese supplier.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Finally, after years of development, hundreds of preorders, and dozens upon dozens of blog posts and concept images hyping up every aspect of the idea, the Optimus Maximus began shipping <a href="https://optimus-project.livejournal.com/53878.html">in February 2008</a>.
</p>


			</div>
		<div>
	
	<p><span>A diagram shows how Art Lebedev’s keys compare to normal laptop and desktop keyboard keys. The Maximus key has a gem-faceted prism of a lens surrounding its screen, while the Popularis key is simply a lens.</span>
</p></div>

		
			<div>
								<p>What was this legendary keyboard actually like to use? In a word: “Terrible.”
</p>


								<p>“Let’s put it this way, we sit around and type all day long and this thing wore us out in about 30 seconds to a minute,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-22-optimus-maximus-at-long-last-we-bring-one-home-to-test.html"><em>Engadget</em> wrote after its first few weeks of testing</a>. “The Optimus Maximus is terrible for touch-typing,” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/optimus-maximus-review/"><em>CNET</em> concurred in its July 2008 review</a>, noting that “the tightly packed keys make for lots of mistaken presses, and the mushy responsiveness slows down your words per minute.” In 2018, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj7GYU-wedo">retro keyboard YouTuber Chyrosran22</a> called the keys “fishy fuck nuggets with a capital F” that are “extremely terrible” to type on.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>These are issues that would be hard to forgive on <em>any</em> keyboard, but the Optimus Maximus also carried a $1,600 price tag in 2008 (north of $2,200 in today’s money). At that price, it had to be perfect, and the reality was far from it.
</p>


			</div>
			<div>
								<p>So Art Lebedev came up with another, cheaper way to make screen-filled keys work: one big screen. In 2012, it released the Optimus Popularis, a more compact keyboard that placed one large LCD display under all its transparent keys, with no need for any individual OLED screens or mechanical switches underneath. Instead, you’d type on <em>lenses</em> that would activate the keyboard’s single large screen, with each lens held floating in place by an aluminum frame. This basic idea is the key to every LCD keyboard we’ve seen since, from the Elgato Stream Deck to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697370/razers-touchscreen-star-wars-the-old-republic-keyboard-hands-on">Razer’s discontinued Switchblade UI</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">the Finalmouse Centerpiece</a>.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Yet fundamental problems remained. Not only was Art Lebedev’s new keyboard only slightly cheaper (it still <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Optimus-Keyboard-LCD-Screens,14365.html">cost north of $1,000</a>) but also the Optimus Popularis was an absolute pig to type on. Art Lebedev was kind enough to send one to us for the purposes of this story, and we had ambitions to write this entire piece on the Popularis. But after half an hour, we gave up. It was a struggle getting the keyboard to register keypresses in the first place. Its space bar, in particular, is a nightmare that refuses to actuate unless you press it firmly enough in exactly the right spot, which is nearly impossible if you want to type at any sort of speed.
</p>


						
								<p>Even in 2024, in an era of phones that are not just smart but that can <em>literally fold in half</em>, we still find ourselves wishing Art Lebedev had been able to deliver on its 2005 concept images. It’s a really beautiful idea with huge amounts of promise. But even if Art Lebedev never truly delivered, it did a lot of the vital iteration to get there.
</p>


							

			</div>
			<p><span>Four</span>  years after the Optimus Popularis’ failure, a strikingly similar gadget appeared on Indiegogo. The “Infinitton” contained just 15 individually customizable LCD keys, much like another old Art Lebedev concept dubbed the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/aux/">Optimus Aux</a>. But this time, gadget lovers didn’t praise the idea to high heaven — the keypad missed its first crowdfunding goal of $30,000 and barely made that money a year later on Kickstarter.
</p>
		<div>
	<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yw-NuGChpbI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p>
</div>

		
			<div>
								<p>But for Taiwanese manufacturer iDisplay, the Infinitton was far from a disappointment — it was a decade-old idea finally paying off.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>That’s because iDisplay was <em>the company</em> that built those OLED and LCD keys for Art Lebedev all those years ago, the Russian design firm and Elgato both confirmed to <em>The Verge</em>. It never stopped working on them. “The success of Optimus Maximus kept me interested to continue the research and development of the built-in screen keys,” iDisplay cofounder Jen Wen Sun tells us via translated email. By 2017, he’d racked up over a dozen patents on the tech and says he sold the screens into broadcast equipment, airplanes, and cars along the way.
</p>


								<p>The company was originally formed in 1998 and worked on <a href="https://www.idisplay.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%9F-79-%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC-5@3x.png">buttons for the gambling industry</a>, he tells us, surviving off small-scale R&amp;D projects while he kept trying to sell casinos on his push-button screens. Casino owner Bally’s was once interested, he says, but a deal never panned out.
</p>


								<p>Back in Germany, the Infinitton caught the attention of Elgato’s Julian Fest, who was researching how to turn his screen-equipped streaming controller idea into a reality. “As we’re thinking about this controller, this crowdfunding campaign comes out and we’re looking at this box and we’re like ‘Oh, this is perfect. We need to talk to these guys,’” Fest recalls.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>By the time Elgato started talking to iDisplay, the Taiwanese company had already solved many of the hardware challenges needed to turn a thousand dollar-plus keyboard into a relatively affordable $149 computer accessory. It could use small off-the-shelf screens similar to what you might find in a car’s infotainment system. And iDisplay had a simpler job on its hands crafting the Stream Deck’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23706779/stream-deck-pop-bubbles-bubbledeck">bubble wrap-esque button feel</a> because it didn’t have to worry about people needing to type at 50-plus words per minute. That feel had been crafted before Elgato ever touched it.

								<p>Elgato essentially turned the Infinitton into the Stream Deck. That first Stream Deck, Fest says, “was really just on a hardware level an iteration of what these guys did.” Look at the original Stream Deck next to the Infinitton, and the resemblance is clear; it’s the same three-by-five grid of buttons turned on its side and with a new housing. “We tried to keep it as simple as possible,” Fest says.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>The way Fest describes it, the main thing Elgato brought to the table when it started working with iDisplay was focus. In its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2086416348/infinitton-a-smart-touch-screen-keyboard/description">Kickstarter campaign for the Infinitton</a>, iDisplay pitched the accessory to anyone and everyone. It was for designers, traders, and musicians. It was for architects, engineers, and programmers. It was for video designers and photographers and business professionals.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>In contrast, Elgato knew exactly who it wanted its Stream Deck to be for: streamers. It held a six-month private beta to collect feedback from its intended users, and it poured a lot of effort into making sure the device integrated nicely with OBS, the industry-standard streaming software. “The big new component then was building software that was tailor made for live streamers,” Fest says. “What we did is we took something existing and just repositioned it for an audience that actually understood and appreciated what this thing could do.”

								<p>That’s not to say Elgato didn’t have any challenges to overcome while developing the Stream Deck with iDisplay. Fest says a big one was ensuring that the Stream Deck could not only send information to a computer but also receive it back and show it to the user. Without being able to stay in sync like this, the Stream Deck risked being the glorified macro pad that critics claimed it was. “If you fire off a hotkey, you don’t know if that action succeeded,” Fest says. “What we wanted to ensure is that if you change a scene in OBS you can clearly see on your device [that] that scene is now active and the other one is not. Or if you mute yourself, you’re muted, and we can guarantee that you’re muted because we’re talking natively to OBS.”
</p>


								<p>The approach worked. iDisplay had sold just a few hundred units of its Infinitton via its crowdfunding campaigns, but the Stream Deck quickly became a staple of the Twitch streamer’s toolkit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/17/15327118/elgato-stream-deck-release-amazon">after its release in 2017</a>. A year later, <a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/corsair-to-acquire-elgato-gaming">Corsair acquired Elgato</a> for an undisclosed sum — and in 2022, <a href="https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-acquires-majority-ownership-taiwan-based-electronics">it bought iDisplay</a>, locking down its LCD keys.
</p>


								<p>Other companies have taken notice. In 2022, Razer introduced the Stream Controller, and a year after that, competing PC accessory manufacturer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23798716/logitech-loupedeck-acquisition-announcement">Logitech snatched up Loupedeck</a>, which had worked with Razer on the rival streaming accessory.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Much like when it morphed its TV tuner into a game recorder, Elgato developed an audience for a technology rather than the other way around. It had been the missing piece of the puzzle since the beginning. But ironically, the audience for the Stream Deck has since expanded almost as wide as the one iDisplay hoped would embrace the Infinitton.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Fest says he knows of Stream Decks being used in the hundreds by organizations ranging from call centers to police dispatcher services. The UK’s Virgin Atlantic airline <a href="https://www.elgato.com/eu/it/s/virgin-atlantic">uses dozens of Stream Decks</a> to simplify communications with pilots and air traffic controllers. Even SpaceX was an early customer, Fest says. (SpaceX did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.) The simple genius of the Stream Deck is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23703402/stream-deck-button-of-the-month">that it made LCD keys <em>peripheral</em></a>, useful for anything where you need a button that dynamically advertises what it’s doing.

			In this 3D animation, the original Optimus keyboard concept and the Stream Deck play a game of digital ping-pong across the entirety of their key-covered screens.

								<p><span>Art</span>  Lebedev was right about one thing: there was indeed a market of people prepared to pay top dollar for premium-quality keyboards. But in retrospect, the Russian design studio bet that the market would go in the opposite direction of the one it actually went in. Instead of a software-based future filled with screens, keyboards embraced <em>hardware</em>, rediscovering mechanical key switches that had been around since the ’80s. Users began fixating on typing feel, seeking out tactile switches and clacky keycaps. The many compromises of LCD keys might have been too much to ask.
</p>


								<p>But Elgato didn’t need to find a balance between typing feel and screen because its Stream Deck aimed to complement a traditional keyboard, rather than replace it. “Everybody has opinions on how Stream Deck’s keys feel. Some absolutely love it. Some say it’s way too mushy. But for everybody, it’s usable,” Fest says. You can forgive a key that feels mushy if you only need to press it to mute yourself while streaming.
</p>


								<p>Which is not to say there’s no space for the kind of screen-based design that Art Lebedev and iDisplay worked to create. The gaming accessories company Finalmouse appears to be banking on exactly that with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23518440/finalmouse-centerpiece-mechanical-keyboard-screen-features-price">forthcoming Centerpiece keyboard</a>, which draws on the single-screen approach of the Popularis but combines it with a set of actual mechanical switches — translucent ones — to retain the feel of a mechanical keyboard.&nbsp;
</p>


								<p>Like the Optimus Maximus, the Centerpiece has already blown past its first promised ship dates and is entering the vaporware realm. But if it does arrive, perhaps function and form will finally be aligned.
</p>


								<p>As for Art Lebedev, it doesn’t consider the Optimus keyboard a failure. “You could argue how successful the project was in terms of return on investment,” Burbaev says, telling us how much business it drummed up for the studio even a decade later. Sometimes a new client would admit that they, too, were fixated by those concept images back when they were a kid.
