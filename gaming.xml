            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just made its Chapter 6 launch trailer available to view in-game, revealing fresh details about the evergreen battle royale's latest revamp.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-estimated-release-date">Chapter 6 isn't due to launch until this weekend</a>, following Saturday night's big Remix live event finale starring Eminem and Snoop Dogg, so the upload of a trailer in-game now looks like an unfortunate slip-up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet has now pounced on the trailer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">confirms the towering Godzilla as an enormous boss</a> that roams around Fortnite's fresh new Japan-inspired map. 
</p>
<p>
There are also smaller bosses - a huge samurai, a floating demon mask - as well as a giant turtle. Hopefully we don't have to shoot the giant turtle. 
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
On an even smaller scale, Fortnite looks to be introducing some kind of cute jelly thing as a pet? Previous artwork showed what looked like pet-like creatures, including a cute-looking dragon, hanging out on characters' shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Oh and finally: Big Hero 6's Baymax - part of the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass - will get to do his 'Balalala' thing as an emote.
</p>
<p>
Despite Chapter 6 being a big revamp for Fortnite, there's actually a fair amount here that feels familiar. Samurai swords are back but look similar to their usage in the game previously. Some of the architecture here looks similar to the Japanese-themed biome back on the Chapter 4 map. And the towering Godzilla boss, let's be honest, feels a little similar to the towering Doctor Doom live event. Although this time with fire breath.
</p>
<p>
We're expecting much more to be officially revealed about Fortnite's future this weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Next week, Chapter 6's launch will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">the arrival of the game's Fortnite OG mode</a> - that brings back Fortnite's beloved original map as a permanent addition <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">with its own battle pass</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Friday has arrived even for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. This week only, GFN users from the free tier (or even newcomers) can upgrade to either Performance or Ultimate memberships for a three-month subscription at half the normal price. This means you'll pay $4.99 monthly for the Performance tier and $9.99 monthly for the Ultimate tier instead of the usual $9.99 and $19.99. As a reminder, the Performance tier is the rebranded Priority tier that was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-upgrades-geforce-now-middle-tier-but-introduces-100-hour-monthly-playtime-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> a resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p. However, NVIDIA also announced plans to introduce a 100-hour monthly playtime cap starting January 1, 2025 for new customers, while every active paid number as of December 31, 2024 will be able to continue avoiding the cap until January 2026, provided that they maintain an active subscription.</p>
<p>As part of the Black Friday deals, GeForce NOW members can also redeem a 30% discount from SteelSeries to purchase the <a href="https://fave.co/4idOI7x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stratus+</a> or <a href="https://fave.co/3Zd0h6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nimbus+</a> controllers for Android or iOS devices, respectively. To redeem the discount, opt-in to GeForce NOW rewards and look out for an email with details. Do note that this exclusive offer cannot be combined with other SteelSeries promotions.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a GeForce NOW update without some new games added to the ever-growing list of over 2K compatible titles. This week, players can start enjoying the following games on NVIDIA's cloud:</p>
<p>● New Arc Line (New release on Steam, Nov. 26)<br>
● MEGA MAN X DiVE Offline Demo (Steam)<br>
● PANICORE (Steam)<br>
● Resident Evil 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour Demo (Steam)<br>
● Slime Rancher (Steam)<br>
● Sumerian Six (Steam)</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a hands-on preview of the steampunk fantasy cRPG New Arc Line earlier this month, following the game's debut on early access.</p>
<p><em>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. However, you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm eager to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</em></p>

<p>Following a controversial reveal, Polaris Quest revealed 16 minutes of Light of Motiram gameplay.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was heavily criticized yesterday following its reveal due to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/">striking resemblanc</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/"> to the Horizon series</a>. Since the initial reveal though, 16 minutes of new gameplay of the game has been revealed, showing the game in somewhat of a different light.</p>



<p>You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="騰訊曝光《荒野起源》15 分鐘實機展示 未來將與 PlayStation 有更多合作" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsq1xnd0CvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It’s fairly obvious that the developers have been heavily inspired (if not just blatantly ripped off) by the Horizon series, but after watching the gameplay, you also see some inspiration taken from other games like ARK and Souls.</p>



<p>The gameplay has left people conflicted. Some think the game looks impressive, whereas others think it’s just an unoriginal idea that borrows concepts and designs from other games.</p>



<p>“I think you can’t be more unoriginal than this,” said YouTube user Xezene on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqwoP_cTo4I&amp;t=502s&amp;ab_channel=Gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reupload of the gameplay</a>. “This looks fantastic,” said YouTube user MrMultiPlatform.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram has been announced to be released sometime in 2025 on PC.</p>

            <p>We’ll chat about what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a>’s new roadmap is bringing to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> in a second, but first, here are some other genres with the -punk suffix I would like to see brought to fruition soon:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Pastrypunk (A sort of Great British Bake Off meets The Running Man murder gameshow)</li>
<li>Beepunk (A gritty post-apocalypse following a catastrophic pandemic that only beekeepers were able to survive due to those funny hats they wear)</li>
<li>Jinglepunk (Christmassy!)</li>
<li>Tescopunk (in which a series of mergers leaves a single surviving Big Tesco and its management as the true underdog in the future corporate forever wars)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even one of these would make me very happy, but here’s something to make you happy, rhetorical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enjoyer. It’s a roadmap. With snow. It is a snowed-map.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First up, there’s several hotfixes culminating in Patch 1.2, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4459221603601877670?l=english">the update</a> says “implements various gameplay and interface changes,” with more details to come soon. “As you all know,” the update teastes “frostland is a dangerous place, full of hidden truths buried beneath layers of ice and time, and you are never quite certain where it may lead you and what it may uncover if you look hard enough…”</p><p>The next big’un is the “Free Major Content Update”. There aren’t any details really, although 11 bit say that “on top of DLCs, we’re committed to adding free content updates, which in many ways were inspired by your feedback, that will significantly impact your overall experience with the game.”</p>
<p>Finally, there’s three pieces of paid DLC planned: two for next year, and one for the year after. That third piece doesn’t have a name, but 2025’s DLC are named ‘Spectrum’ and ‘Aurora’. “Rest assured,” say 11 bit, “these major milestones are only part of what’s to come. Alongside them, we will continuously work on hotfixes and improvements to the game and its overall stability. Right on the horizon we have the Patch 1.2 that implements various gameplay and interface changes - more on that very soon.”</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a “an atmospheric, bold attempt to reinvent its own society-moulding subgenre,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review?view=comments">reckoned Sin</a> in her review, “whose story and building features too often frustrate with too few options or distract with too many.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.

After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements">Lies of P is also receiving a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 continues its solid sales performance. The game developed by Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=space+marine+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units within a day of its debut (considering pre-orders, of course) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out</a> to be the second best-selling game launch of the year in Europe. Less than three months later, the studio <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/119-november-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Space Marine 2 broke the milestone of five million copies sold, which proves that the game was well-received among the notoriously picky Warhammer 40K fans.</p>
<p>Saber also took the opportunity to reveal to the community that Patch 5.0 would be released in the first half of December, which means in the next couple of weeks. The update will add a new PvE co-op Operation called Obelisk, in which players must rotate a replica of the Obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This Operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p>
<p>To reach the console control of the obelisk, players must venture through a dark tomb. It will be even more challenging due to a new addition to the Chaos roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy. They will now appear in every PvE Operation featuring Chaos.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also getting a big customization improvement with the next update. Color lenses have finally been added, allowing players to customize between fifteen colors. Moreover, the patch will also bring the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, adding the unique armor set Dark Angels Champion as well as three themed weapons and one themed shield (for the Bulwark class).</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Patch 5.0 will introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation, bumping frame rates across the board on PC.</p>

<p>Saber also told fans to look forward to Titus's story continuing in Amazon's Secret Level Prime Video series, which will feature a dedicated Space Marine 2 episode. To celebrate the event, they will activate special Twitch Drops between December 10 and 31.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> is coming in December, with the addition of a huge new island to the game. Pocketpair has also revealed a crossover collaboration with Terraria for their monster catching survival game that will arrive in 2025.</p>
<p>There’s few details to go on at this point, but the new island will be about six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in the last major update in June. This new locale will bring “Powerful tower bosses and many vicious new species of Pals lurk here.”</p>


<p>They also promise, “A large amount of new content will also be added.”</p>

		
		

<p>Palworld launched into early access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the start of this year – the console exclusivity going hand in hand with being day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> – before spreading its cute monster-y wings onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation</a> in September. The game really took the world by storm, with the “meme game” concept of being Pokémon with guns grabbing people’s attention, but then also appealing to core gamers by leaning into other popular genres like survival and base building.</p>
<p>That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

<p>We’ll just have to wait and see, but even with the spectre of legal trouble in the background, it’s good to see that Pocketpair is forging ahead with big updates such as this.</p>
<p>We expect to see more news in due course, with The Game Awards a likely avenue for some kind of reveal or announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/what-we-played-death-stranding-30-birds-towers-of-aghasba/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one of those weeks where I ignored the games I’ve been playing for a while (sorry Metaphor: ReFantazio) and started something completely different, setting out for a walk with Sam in Death Stranding. I have to say that the opening must be amongst the most cinematic game experiences I think I’ve ever had, and I absolutely love the world and the weirdness. I’m on a massive sci-fi kick at the moment too – you should all be watching Silo Season 2 on Apple TV+ – so it’s just the perfect game to match up with that.</p>

<p>In a surprise to no-one <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 as his one chill out game, but <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/30-birds-review/">30 Birds for review</a> and it is apparently very good! He’s also started Loco Motive for review. Finally, he’s revisiting an old favourite and started replaying The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played plenty more Phasmophobia, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, which is another VR game with telekinetic powers and guns, saying, “It’s great! (And on PS+ Premium game catalogue).”</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/">Towers of Aghasba</a> which offers some intriguing twists on the survival sandbox genre. He told us, “There’s still a lot of resource gathering, crafting, and base building, but also some cool features like nurturing emergent ecosystems and a more narrative-driven focus. It’s still in early access and I’m hoping the introduction of multiplayer will help dial up the fun factor.</p>
<p>“I’ve also been playing Assassin’s Creed Mirage which I really struggled with at first due to the rather basic combat and filler missions. Although I enjoy Basim as a protagonist, there’s only so many times Ubisoft can repeat the same assassin origin story – that said, roaming the streets of Baghdad and moving away from the RPG-ness of more recent AC games has provided a fun romp that also eschews any effort to pursue AC’s present-day storyline.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> has been getting real “Remember when Freddos were 10p?” Vibes from the Steam sale, saying. “20% off doesn’t feel like 20% off when the end result is still £40.” So he’s not actually bought anything new, but has got some bits of back catalogue in his basket. His gaming this week has been fits and starts of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, as he still hasn’t quite figured out which of the many Warhammer 40,000 games is the new one that everyone loved back in September. That and some GT7 on PS5 Pro with its shiny new ray traced reflections.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also perused the Steam sales, picking up UFO50 as an early Christmas present but just some super cheap horror stuff alongside that. Giving his new Switch a workout, Ade has been playing Bayonetta 3 and absolutely loving it. He says, “It’s a totally bonkers but totally brilliant game. It’s reminded me how much I love Platinum Games – with Vanquish being my absolute favourite – I’ve got a hankering to give Astral Chain a play next!” You’re in for a treat if you do!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

It's normally $150 but there's a 50% discount for Black Friday that drops it to only $74.99.

This would make an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers">gift idea for any gaming fan</a> who loves working on complex building block kits like LEGO.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h2><div catalogid="71c42985-9d8c-4c5d-a28d-7485a219d539" id="211751"><div id="211751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The MEGA Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set is a buildable 3:4 scale replica of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/xbox-360-the-launch-review">Xbox 360 console</a> with a brick count total of 1,342 pieces (5.5 cents per brick). The details in this build are, frankly, incredible, and include interactive elements, lighting effects, and the coolest accessories. Here's a rundown of the biggest highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console exterior is well represented with details like a removable hard drive, ventilation holes in the rear, text in the right places, and lighting effects. Unfortunately, there's no option to swap in a red ring of death.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console internals are just as faithfully reproduced as the exterior. There's a tray to pop in the supplied Xbox game disc (we'll get to this later), the motherboard, various heatsinks and doodads all connected by wires, and even a fancy little Cortana chip. It's also easy to get into the console (just press a little green button).</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The set includes an authentic looking mini <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/23/halo-3-review">Halo 3</a> game disc complete with a detailed Halo game box that looks just like the real thing. That's not even the best part. You can place the Halo disc into the console's internal disc tray and it will light up the Cortana chip inside. How cool is that!?!</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox controller has a removable battery pack. When you slide in the battery pack, the controller's guide button lights up.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-years-after-you-ended-the-world-in-plague-inc-you-can-now-rebuild-it-in-after-inc.1047885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/plague-inc-rebuild-after-inc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NDemic Creations, the developer behind the remarkably popular world-ending title, Plague Inc., has released After Inc. This mobile game follows directly on from the 2012 apocalypse-inducing epic, inviting players to build a settlement and reshape society.</p>



<p>It’s a complete flip from the first game, in which your chief goal was to rid the world of humans by creating a disease so powerful that it couldn’t be stopped. Anyone who played it knows how open-ended it was, and they also know that living in Iceland or Madagascar was usually the best way to avoid catching the nasty diseases concocted by players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-rebuild">We Can Rebuild</h2>



<p>After Inc. is available now on iOS and Android, and it comes twelve years after the release of the first game. That’s about right in the post-apocalyptic stakes – things have to blow over before you can start rebuilding, right?</p>



<p>Per a post advertising the launch of the game, Ndemic wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After Inc. (is) a unique blend of strategic simulation, survival city builder and ‘mini 4X’. The Necroa Virus has ravaged humanity – build a settlement and shape your post-apocalyptic society.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s coming to Steam in 2025, which follows in the footsteps of Plague Inc., which launched first as a mobile exclusive game before being ported to PC. It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist now on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>At first blush, After Inc. is much more immersive and involved than Plague Inc. Players are introduced to a more detailed, granular world, and while they’re still able to influence things across a wider area, After Inc. is more focused on rebuilding the world on a localised scale than it is tearing it down on a global one.</p>



<p>To that end, After Inc. is set primarily in the United Kingdom, which is where Ndemic Creations is based.</p>



<p>In After Inc., players are invited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore ruins</li>



<li>Farm resources</li>



<li>Build and expand settlements</li>



<li>Make tough decisions</li>



<li>Extermine zombie infestations</li>



<li>Follow an intense campaign</li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a long time coming, and while most fans of Plague Inc. didn’t expect it to service, it’s a welcome addition to 2024’s gaming lineup.</p>



<p>Did you destroy the world in Plague Inc.? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a> on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it's the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.
</p>
<p>So it is in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ-unflattened">Trombone Champ: Unflattened</a>, a VR spin-off that's out now.

<p>Made by Flat2VR Studios, a company that specialises in, as their name suggests, bringing games from flat screens to VR, Unflattened seems like more than a straight re-formatting. The menus are all new, the notes whizz towards you <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a>-style, there are cosmetic unlocks for the trombone, and you can unlock and trade cards of famous musicians from throughout history.
</p>
<p>The fundamental tooting remains the same, mind you. Trombone Champ: Unflattened is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151670/Trombone_Champ_Unflattened/">available from Steam</a> and will work with more VR headsets than just the Meta Quest featured in the trailer above. It costs £12.79/€14.79/$15.
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Unflattened will retain the best thing about the original: the community that surrounds it. Trombone Champ players have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">organised championship competitions</a>, made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-final-fantasy-7-trombone-champ-mod-is-pitch-perfect">custom tracks</a>, and turned those custom tracks into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">excellent YouTube videos</a> to enjoy whether or not you play the game yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Steam autumn sale</a>. 
</p>
<p>Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I think I'm right in saying that Steam sales are, at the very least, not <em>as</em> exciting as they once were, if only because we've grown used to them. It no longer seems like a miraculous surprise to have so many games deeply discounted all at once. Doubly and triply so once you factor in all the other digital storefronts, all of which also have their own big seasonal sales.

<p>Maybe it's also just become harder to find the truly spectacular deals because there's now so many of them. Sure, it's great that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> is £1.59, but it's forever slashed to cheap, so it's hard to get pumped about it. Instead it just feels like it's obscuring the handful of games where its discount is actually news. 
</p><p>It feels like a bigger deal that Hitman: World Of Assassination is a mere £2.49, a full 90% off for some of the best stealth gaming ever made. 25% off a game as new as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is significant, although it's still £45. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> at £30 feels like a good entry point for players uncertain about a slightly off-kilter fantasy RPG.
</p>
<p>Maybe we just all permanently have more games than we can ever play now. Between bundles and freebies, who needs spend money, discounted or otherwise, just to throw another game on the backlog?
</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm simply out of touch. There are definitely going to be some people saving their pennies and waiting for each new Steam sale to arrive, and more power to you. I'm not pooh-poohing Steam sales, so please put away your phone flashlights. I am genuinely curious how the RPS commenter is split, however: do you share my malaise, or are you currently posting Gaben memes in the group chat? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s launch server issues have been resolved, Asobo Studio has stated, with server capacity now increased to meet demand and reliability at over 99.999%. Patches are due next week on 2nd and 9th December aiming to make further client-side improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-27-update/">update to the community</a> follows on from launch woes that saw players shoved into unending queues and the servers unable to cope with demand. <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now/">Hotfix 1</a> was released last Friday on 22nd November to address key snags that people were facing, though there is one outstanding issue with outdated marketplace content from MSFS 2020 clashing with the new install of MSFS 2024 on PC.</p>


<p>As noted last week, “outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behavior.” The advice was basically to remove that content.</p>
<p>Along these lines, most MSFS 2020 content has now been ported across to MSFS 2024, though with community reports and analytics showing that some 3rd party add-ons are still problematic, Asobo is currently blocking all MSFS 2020 non-aircraft content from use with MSFS 2024.</p>
<p>The patch on 9th December will add a feature for users to disable and enable content themselves, and a safe boot option that can deactivate all 3rd party content at once if you’re struggling to launch the game.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://flightsimulator.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16882910197148-Known-issues-for-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-2024">an FAQ for outstanding issues</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the circles you fly in, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has maybe flown under the radar – heh – compared to its predecessor. The 2020 game was a marvel of conception and execution, able to approximate the entire world for players to fly in, and then with Asobo releasing a long-running stream of content updates to add more human-created touches of reality. MSFS 2024 sounds like it would be more iterative – and purchased content does carry forward – but has made some major changes to allow you to land and hop out of your aircraft, to bring a more meaningful career mode to the game with new mission types, and more.</p>
