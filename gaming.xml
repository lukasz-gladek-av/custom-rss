While the franchise’s next major entry, Wilds, will surely be no different when it launches early next year, those who hopped into its pre-release beta yesterday are finding that its monsters don’t look quite as they expected. Specifically, many creatures currently sport low-poly models that make them look like they just hopped straight of a PS1 game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Wilds beta seems to be struggling with its polygons</p><p>Here's a thread of any comically low-poly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MHWilds</a> images I come across that are too funny to ignore🧵:</p><p>Feel free to drop your own low-poly encounters</p><p>Starting off with a low poly Seikret <a href="https://t.co/ilbAUb7cet" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ilbAUb7cet</a></p></div>— TeaCommonShark (@khitwins) <a href="https://twitter.com/khitwins/status/1852264130734100559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear what exactly is causing these low-poly monsters to infest the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, but it appears that PC players are being affected the most. While an issue as widespread as this would be a concern for players who just picked up a finished game, there are those who can’t help but find the fun in this visual glitch during this pre-launch test. Many, including X/Twitter user @khitwins, have taken the opportunity to collect their findings in <a href="https://x.com/khitwins/status/1852264130734100559" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a thread of posts</u></a> while asking others to do the same.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-dragon-age-review-controversy-shows-how-much-youtube-and-twitter-have-poisoned-video-game-discourse.1025790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, when a big new game comes out, you can pretty much roll the dice on what kind of reactionary controversy it will produce. Are we looking at a moral panic over trans characters? Diversity consulting? Games journalists being too positive? Games journalists being too negative? Some other quibble that will be forgotten in a week, interchangeably swapped out like grains of sand dragged away by the unrelenting tide? Anyway, the usual suspects got mad about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reviews this week.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours for a full rundown of <em>why</em>, but the whole thing is illustrative of a larger, more important issue: Thanks to algorithmic prioritization on sites like YouTube and Twitter, this is how a growing number of people engage with video games. Plenty of normal people still manage to tune it out the hours-long rants and conspiracy theories, but at what point does this rancid flavor of brain rot go from a vocal niche to a borderline-mainstream position? And what are the long-term consequences of that?</p><p>Also on this week’s episode: We lament <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the untimely end of Firewalk</a>, the studio that made <em>Concord </em>to Sony’s specifications and then promptly got dumpstered for it. Will the industry actually learn from this? We can only hope. Then we move on to more media layoffs, <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time at Fandom</a>, which owns GameSpot, among a sometimes-baffling lineup of other properties (TV’s Guide’s website? Huh!). Oh, and we solve <em>the hell</em> out of what would seem to be an impossible puzzle: How does a worm drive a little apple car?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can grow so large that it becomes the entire internet, supplanting YouTube and other platforms with the kinds of refreshingly chill conversations we regularly have in our Discord (which you can join by <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribing to our “member” tier</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I guess my doomer-pilled concern about all of this is that as the American fascist project continues to grow in power and all of these platforms facilitate these ways of talking about things – conspiratorial thinking and whatnot – do we reach a point where [this becomes the default]? Because I would say that right now, this is still not the way most normal people talk about games or engage with them. A lot of people, as we see even based on <em>Dragon Age</em>’s Steam numbers right now, saw this game, thought it looked cool, bought it, and now they’re playing it. If you look at Asmongold’s most-viewed video about all of this, it has around one million views. One million sounds like a lot! But this game will probably be bought by north of ten million people. So it’s a fraction. And even then, a lot of the people who watched that video were probably never going to buy the game anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s not negligible, exactly, but it’s still a niche. But as these things continue to have relatively convenient onramps – like searching “<em>Dragon Age</em>” on YouTube and getting pulled down this rabbit hole – do we reach a point where this is the predominant mode of conversation around games? Inmates taking over the asylum or whatever; is that where we’re headed? Because we’ve seen this in American politics: The more you enable these people structurally or systematically, the more footing they gain until they become a default.&nbsp;</p><p>Are we looking at that in the conversation around games, too? Are we already a large part of the way there? And then to what extent are the people who are engaging with this stuff and dunking on these people constantly also facilitating it? I don’t know. I hate to use this phrase, but I’m just asking questions. It’s one of those things that… I wouldn’t say it keeps me up at night, but when I can’t sleep, I’m like “I may as well also make myself feel bad.” And so I start thinking about things like this.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I want to say that it’s still a small number of people broadly. And I was talking to someone else this week about how we see the internet, but there are also millions of people playing video games who are not on the internet. So what are people actually doing? To some extent, you’ll never know. And I want to say that at least on Twitter, it’s an echo chamber. But I don’t know. This conspiracy about Sweet Baby, is it this widespread conspiracy, or is it three loud guys and their friends? I think seeing this colloquial usage of it <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dualshockers-promotes-idiotic-alt-right-sweet-baby-conspiracy-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-hastily-deletes.1021527/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this DualShockers review</a> makes me think “Oh God, maybe it’s a bigger thing.” Who just says that?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I think an important thing to remember is, we work in video games, and we work directly with people who know as much about video games as possible and as much about the video game media ecosystem as possible. The people who follow us on social media, all they do is talk about video games all day. Our peers and colleagues and former colleagues, that’s all we talk about. As a sample of the game-playing public, we are a tiny fraction of people. All my IRL friends will talk to me about a <em>Call of Duty</em> game once a year. Everyone I play football with will talk to me about <em>EA Sports FC</em> once or twice a year to complain about it. They don’t play <em>Dragon Age</em>. They don’t know what it is. They barely know what <em>Fortnite </em>is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same for everything: It’s music. It’s movies. People don’t consume media about these things constantly on a daily basis. It’s easy for us to lose track of that because we think everybody does, because everybody around us does. But my experience with this stuff – because I make it my point to know as many people outside of games as possible to avoid becoming a broken husk of a person – is [that] it’s really important to get that perspective. It’s fucking video games. No one cares. Play a game you like or don’t. You don’t need to go online and talk about it for 18 hours a day or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, people like Asmongold are out there making these videos, but like Nathan said, what’s a video like that going to top out at? A million? Worldwide? Among English-speaking people? That’s not shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right. There are well over 300 million people in the United States alone.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Right, and that doesn’t include English-speaking people in Europe and the rest of the Anglosphere. I don’t think it’s something to be worried about as a discourse-shaping trend; it’s more just a bummer for that type of content on that type of medium. It’s gonna go on its own journey, and during that time people are going to be put off it. People might stop watching that kind of content and look somewhere else. They might look on TikTok or on blogs like Aftermath dot site. </p><p>It’s not a given that every 13 year-old boy watching an Asmongold video is going to turn into someone who thinks like that.&nbsp;Most people are relatively normal, and there’s a point where once people with a certain kind of hateful or twisted or conspiratorial view start to get oxygen and start to get enabled, their views become increasingly bizarre to a normal person. People aren’t so easily brainwashed that they’ll all just go along with that. </p><p>Obviously the political situation in the United States shows that lots of people can if they’re subjected to it long and hard enough, but on a global basis, on a normal-person basis, a lot of people will eventually be like “I think this guy’s fucking weird” or “Who cares? It’s <em>Dragon Age</em>” or “Not everything has to be a conspiracy and a political gesture.” I’m more optimistic than other people are with that stuff, but it’s more of a YouTube problem than a societal problem. They need to sort that out.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>True, but in addition it’s a Twitter problem, it’s a Facebook problem, with Asmongold there it’s a Twitch problem, it is to some extent a TikTok problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> But Facebook is a great example because kids don’t use Facebook anymore. It’s boomer shit, and it’s full of weirdos, so they stopped using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> But it’s a radicalization engine for boomers. All of these things are radicalization engines. They all ended up at the same place despite starting at different starting points. If we’re just talking on radicalization engines – those are our main means of communication – then how long until everyone is some flavor of radicalized, and not for the better? And again, you talk about polarized politics in our country; we’re already part of the way there. I hope that things get better, but I think that will require a concerted effort on the part of those who want them to be better to build something else. I think as long as we’re doing it all [on these platforms], there will be a slow but steady downward trend.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is the third patch to arrive since last weekend’s release and adds a host of tweaks and fixes for glitches big and small. Although the update largely focuses on Multiplayer and Zombies, it also includes a trio of universal touch-ups, including the removal of that pesky black screen glitch that has bothered players when trying to load into a match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/codblops6-1725926226920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update brings fixes for Multiplayer and Zombies.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Multiplayer adjustments include the removal of Lowtown from the Infected map pool while adding the same mode to Private Match’s list of available modes. Players will now find that the Shotgun Slug attachment deals the correct amount of damage, too. Stability improvements have also arrived to address hiccups revolving around the UAV Scorestreak, Infected medals, and the Vigilance Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s typical for some players to take advantage of map exploits shortly after launch, and it’s also typical for the team at Activision to move quickly when squashing these exploits. Today’s update is no different, as it comes with a few patched exploits in the Zombies mode. Specifically, enjoyers of the round-based game mode will no longer be able to re-activate timed GobbleGums for extra use. Additionally, the Tactical Raft can no longer be used to block zombie paths on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 launched last Friday and has already positioned itself as one of the most successful Call of Duty games of all time. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>the series’ biggest launch ever</u></a> earlier this week. Call of Duty GM Matt Cox added, “Black Ops 6 is an amazing game, and the response from the Call of Duty community has been incredible. This is only the beginning.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of the updated Nuketown map today, players can expect to dive into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>Black Ops 6 Season 1 when it launches November 14</u></a>.

In the time since, consoles and PCs alike have progressed even further, giving developers more power than ever to work with. As such, Sony has opted to revisit this hit game to bring its presentation more in line with its sequel, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, with a killer remaster that packs in a whole lot of improvements. Here’s what you need to know about <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>.</p><h2 id="h127013"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s new in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was already a stunning game on PlayStation 4, and the 60fps update it received a while back for PlayStation 5 left a lot of folks questioning if it even needed a remaster. Well, however you felt about that, a quick glance at the many improvements makes it easy to appreciate this lovingly-crafted upgrade.</p><p>So what’s new? Here’s a breakdown of the most notable changes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The overall visuals have been drastically improved, with better textures, increased foliage density, and reworked lighting</li><li>There are more than 10 hours of re-recorded dialogue and motion capture that make characters appear considerably less stiff in cutscenes, looking far more fluid like those in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></li><li>DualSense support is now available, offering haptic feedback and adaptive trigger functionality</li><li>You can now fully remap your controls</li><li>A wide variety of new accessibility features can be toggled on and off</li><li>Remixed audio that takes advantage of Dolby Atmos and PlayStation’s Tempest 3D AudioTech</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-recommend-id="image://74ee52ccf17d7e60c590e2d2114a3986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Since <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> is the same game as the original, returning players should have a pretty good idea of its length and content. If you’re new to the game, though, you may be curious how long it’ll take to complete.</p><p>An average playthrough of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> should take you around <strong>20 to 25 hours</strong>. This includes casually dabbling in a few side activities but mostly focusing on the main story. Of course, the remaster also includes the game’s only DLC, <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, which can take another 10 to 15 hours to experience.</p><p>However, those seeking to see and do everything the main game and DLC has to offer can spend up to <strong>80 hours</strong> exploring its stunning landscapes, to clear all the bandit camps, climb all of the Longnecks, and finish a wide variety of other optional but rewarding tasks—doing that ultimately results in earning its coveted Platinum trophy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-recommend-id="image://02f730c620867dc161363d525ba744b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> was originally developed by Guerrilla Games, the same team that brought to life PlayStation’s long-running <em>Killzone</em> franchise. They have since focused on releasing more games in the series, including <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, and the upcoming <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> was remastered by Nixxes, who are best known for porting or remastering other popular PlayStation exclusives, like <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>. They’ve got a firm grip on this process, and it shows in this beautifully upgraded version of a game that was already gorgeous on PlayStation 4.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-recommend-id="image://60d6a06738be1202229ca1234c113b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> is available on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p>Since the game is published by Sony, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never release on Xbox or Nintendo consoles.

<p>Prime Gaming is a sweet deal for anyone already subscribed to Amazon Prime. It’s arguably one of the best aspects of the service for a gamer, as the platform offers up stacks of free games every month for you to download across a range of platforms. It’s a shame that the games are almost always exclusive to PC players but never mind.</p>



<p>Amazon has revealed a hefty assortment of games coming to the platform <strong>for free </strong>in November – check out the full list below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-free-game-on-prime-gaming-in-november">Every Free Game on Prime Gaming in November</h2>



<p>There are some seriously tantalising titles coming to Prime Gaming through November.</p>



<p>As usual, the release of these games will be staggered, and to pick up a certain game you’ve got your eye on, you might still need to wait a few weeks before it’s available. Also, you’ll need to be willing to use a series of platforms and storefronts to redeem the games – GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games, for instance.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Prime Gaming games in November:</p>



<p><strong>November 1 – Available Now</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy (Epic)</li>



<li>Mafia: Definitive Edition (GOG)</li>

On Steam, a whopping 463,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying Capcom’s upcoming title, putting it in the platform’s top four games by player count in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>It’s storming up the charts on other platforms, too. The launch of the Monster Hunter Wilds beta has even dwarfed the likes of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which was released just yesterday.</p>

<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is great, but it’s not running well on PC. Players have reported widespread issues, including an unpredictable frame rate and a bizarre problem that’s turning enemies into polygonal nightmares.</p>



<p>Many have written the game off because of the somewhat exorbitant system requirements, so that might go some way to explaining the issues. However, Capcom has assured users that it’s acting on all the feedback received during the beta, and the base game is ‘already better’ because of it.</p>



<p>The team has been quick to address the biggest issues through support functions on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you’re experiencing issues in the Steam version of the Open Beta Test, please check out our Troubleshooting &amp; Known Issues guide: <a href="https://t.co/KNr7t4ECRS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bit.ly/OBTsupport</a>.</p>



<p>The issue of afterimage noise occurring in certain environments when Frame Generation is enabled will be fixed in the full game, which is already in a more improved state compared to the beta test.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the support options are pretty thin, directing players to generic troubleshooting articles that offer advice that’s not at all tailored to the game or any specific problems. </p>



<p>Despite the technical issues, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta continues to perform well, numbers-wise. At the time of writing, 144,000 players were logged into the game on Steam alone, and on Twitch, it’s beating Counter-Strike, Escape from Tarkov, and Apex Legends.</p>

                <p>Activision has released the latest in its "Replacer" line of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 ads, and this one is maybe the best and funniest yet. If you're just catching up, Peter Stormare plays a character called The Replacer; he's the guy who replaces you because you're too busy playing Call of Duty.</p><p>In this newest spot, The Replacer fills in for Tonya on Jeopardy, before having a hilarious exchange with Jeopardy host Ken Jennings that culminates in The Replacer replacing Jennings. It's good stuff, riffing on Saturday Night Live's popular series of Jeopardy spoofs with a contestant messing with the host.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORamyqb1G0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gORamyqb1G0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Activision has created more than two dozen of these Replacer ads for Black Ops 6, featuring Stormare replacing all manner of people, including TV hosts, the Pope, the NFL's Kyler Murray, boxer Canelo Alvarez, podcast host Joe Rogan, and political analysts. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see all the spots on the Call of Duty YouTube page.</a></p><p>Stormare's The Replacer debuted in 2013 and has been a mainstay for Activision's Black Ops marketing campaigns over the years. The first in the series of commercials for Black Ops 6 featuring The Replacer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-brings-back-popular-character-for-black-ops-6-marketing-and-he-pretends-to-be-the-pope/1100-6526771/" data-ref-id="1100-6526771">went live during NFL matchups back in September.</a></p><p>The Replacer has even replaced an in-game Call of Duty: Warzone character, Graves, prompting some to believe he could actually be released in the game sometime down the road. It remains to be seen if that will happen, however.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched on October 25 and was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-spiked-call-of-duty-to-a-bonkers-day-on-xbox/1100-6527515/" data-ref-id="1100-6527515">quick success</a>.

Presumably, travel would be slow, costly, and strategic. It no doubt would have introduced new alien enemy types as well, potentially introducing some interesting sci-fi mysteries about the origins of human and Locust life on Sera.</p><p>The industry veteran suggested those ideas, which didn’t sound like anything more than a pitch document at the time, were scrapped as The Coalition works instead on mining Gears’ past with a prequel centered around Emergence Day, the franchise’s version of the Invasion of Normandy when millions of Locust came out of holes in the ground to attack humanity, eventually leading to the use of weapons of mass destruction that ended up crippling Sera’s surface-dwelling nations.</p><p><em>Gears 5</em> also ended with a cliffhanger related to a choice about which main character to rescue, the consequences of which would seemingly get hashed out in<em> Gears 6</em>. It sounded like the plan was for the most popular choice among players to become the canonical one. Though, at the rate the franchise is going, it could be years before fans get to see that play out in a game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/todd-howard-didn%E2%80%99t-want-troy-baker-to-play-indiana-jones.1025661/</guid>

<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be in our hands and on our consoles and other assorted platforms in little more than a month. It was over a year ago that Bethesda Game Studios lifted the lid on Indy’s next adventure – and subsequently revealed that the iconic adventurer would be played by none other than Troy Baker.</p>



<p>However, in the months leading up to the production of the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard was against signing the superstar actor for the lead role.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-people-chose-you-every-time">‘People Chose You Every Time’</h2>



<p>Troy Baker is one of the most storied voice actors in the industry. From BioShock to Shadow of Mordor, and from The Last of Us to inFamous, he has been around the block more than a few times.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chat with Troy Baker</a> recently about a new cyberpunk-themed project he worked on.</p>



<p>It seemed like an obvious choice to pair Baker with Jones, as almost anything the actor touches turns to gold. But Todd Howard, one of Bethesda Game Studios’ most senior heads, originally rejected the idea of hiring Baker.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Rolling Stone</a>, Todd Howard and Troy Baker were captured offering their thoughts on the same page. It was revealed that the pair hadn’t properly met before they touched base regarding the role of Indiana Jones. It was stated that Howard outrightly told Troy over a video call that he ‘wasn’t what they wanted’.</p>



<p>This was despite audiences reacting positively to Baker’s performances:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>‘We felt for this project and the time period it was set in, we cast a pretty wide net,’ </em>Howard says. <em>‘I’ll have you know, we did a blind taste test, and people chose you every time.’</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the team – and Todd Howard – opted to bring in Troy Baker to perform the role of the legendary treasure hunter. </p>



<p>Do you think they made the right decision? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Both appeared in some promotional videos for the episode, and yeah, Mulaney is there, but Roan’s elaborate outfit is the star of the show. The green and gold outfit features a huge crescent headpiece with gold waist pieces stretching out to the side that seemingly double as armrests. The whole fit is something straight out of a fantasy RPG, and folks in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/rocco_botte/status/1852246952647225794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/rocco_botte/status/1852246952647225794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fandoms like <em>Final Fantasy</em></a></span> are jumping on the jokes.

The day after launch—a work day for most people—saw those numbers sitting around 62,000. Now, I know many people will think 70,000 isn’t all that impressive, as it doesn’t break the top ten most-played games on Steam, but it did surpass <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for a time, which is no small feat. Even more impressive is that, on day one, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> outsold <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on Steam, pushing the FPS down a spot on the top seller’s leaderboard.<br></p><p>If you spend any amount of time online today, you’ll find plenty of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">discourse surrounding <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>. A vocal minority continues downplaying its significance, claiming the <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> beta test outperforms the full <em>Dragon Age</em> release. Yeah, it does. But <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a free-to-play, limited beta. So, obviously it’ll outperform a full-price RPG. We can celebrate both!<br></p><p>So, why is <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>outperforming EA’s other single-player hits? It’s a well-crafted RPG with action-combat mechanics, impressive world design, perhaps one of the best character creators in the genre, and an expansive storyline spanning nearly 100 hours to complete. Oh, and it’s Steam Deck compatible and doesn’t require the EA App!<br></p><p>If you’re jumping into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/kckxlp1mp2bpm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/kckxlp1mp2bpm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> this weekend, pay close attention if you want to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-explained-executors-1851686439">unlock the game’s secret ending</a></span>!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FINAL FANTASY XIV - Patch 7.1" Crossroads" Preview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For those who fancy a challenge, Chaotic Alliance Raids will be introduced. These are harder versions of existing alliance raids. One week after the subsequent sub-patch 7.15 is released, the "Cloud of Darkness (Chaotic)" raid will launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-says-studio-head/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>and is already off to a great start. It's been blowing up on social media and has received nonstop buzz online. At the moment, it has a Mostly Positive review rating on Steam. This game has been wanted by Dragon Age fans for a long time, as Dragon Age: Inquisition was released in 2014, making it a whopping 10-year wait for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The latest game in the Dragon Age franchise had been in development for years by 2020 and was in deep water by that point. It had been rebooted from a single-player game into a live-service game with heavy multiplayer elements, a component often seen in recent EA games, including games like Anthem. As we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> at the time, some employees within the company were referring to the next Dragon Age game as "Anthem with dragons." Once Gary McKay <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-confirms-gary-mckay-as-gm-success-is-all-about-rebuilding-our-reputation-and-delivering-on-our-promise-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took over</a> in 2020, he was determined to make sure that the same mistakes were not made when creating Dragon Age: The Veilguard. After he took over, he began to meet with some of the leadership in BioWare and EA and made the decision to take Dragon Age back to single-player.</p>
<p>This information comes from a report&nbsp;<span>by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-01/-dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-high-stakes-at-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier at Bloomberg</a>, where Gary McKay's thought process behind this game was explained in detail. For McKay, it made perfect sense to revert the game back to single-player</span>, as games like Anthem didn't succeed, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a huge hit with fans of Star Wars and those who weren't.</p>
<p>"Once we made that decision, a lot of things started to fall into place," said McKay. However, there were other setbacks and obstacles. The pandemic was a huge one, as BioWare had to start hiring people remotely, which "made for cultural challenges," said McKay. As a result, the game didn't come out by its original target date; instead, it came out this week. Last summer, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-layoffs-mass-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw</a> a layoff of 50 people at BioWare, which included some of the company's top names. McKay said in the interview with Schreier that the industry "was all about focus at that time. When you have a really large team, you're always compelled to keep everybody busy all the time. When you have a smaller team, you have the right people in the right roles at the right time; some incredible momentum is gained at that point."</p>
<p>So far, Dragon Age: The Veilguard seems to be performing well, but neither EA nor BioWare have released any numbers at this point. It's uncertain whether they will, but it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/">currently topping charts on Steam</a>. Maybe this is the boost both BioWare and EA need to start developing some great games in the future, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-still-hasn%E2%80%99t-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs.1025568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy's Alan Wake 2 was a resounding critical success when it launched last year. It matched the studio's historic highest Metacritic score (Max Payne's 89). Here on Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score from Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Despite not aiming to revolutionize the survival horror genre, Alan Wake II is an amazing game that no one who enjoys a good trippy horror story should pass on. Remedy Entertainment really outdid themselves, releasing their best game to date and one of the most immersive gaming experiences of the past few years.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn't quite sell Gangbusters. Back in March, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-alan-wake-2-has-recouped-most-of-the-investment-studio-plans-more-regular-sequels-for-aw-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Alan Wake 2 had recouped 'most' of its investment. The latest report that the Finnish company <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> today makes it sound like Alan Wake 2 barely went forward—the game still hasn't recouped all the costs.</p>
<p><em>At the end of the quarter, Alan Wake 2 had recouped most of its development and marketing expenses. After the end of the quarter, the second expansion of Alan Wake 2, The Lake House, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> on October 22 alongside the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game.</em></p>
<p>Remedy's games were never really huge mainstream hits. Still, two factors probably contributed to the relatively low sales. For one thing, they launched the game only in digital stores, but that's now been rectified, as mentioned above; the retail debut might bring in a few more players. More importantly, Epic Games funded the game's development and therefore secured a permanent exclusive for its own store on PC. This meant no release on Steam, which would have certainly brought in a larger audience. On the other hand, without Epic Games, Alan Wake 2 might not have been made at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala also addressed investors on the status of the future projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, previously codename Condor, continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Control 2 has progressed well in the production readiness stage and is on track to start full production during 2025. Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested in preparation for full production.</em></li>
<li><em>Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making steady progress in full production. The development team continues their work, gradually reaching important milestones.</em></li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is rolling back one of the biggest changes to its laptop chips in years. Remember how this fall’s Lunar Lake laptops <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">ditched the idea of memory sticks</a>, putting a fixed amount of RAM on the processor package instead? Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger now says that turned out to be a financial mistake, and Intel won’t do it again. Oh, and he may be axing desktop GPUs, too.</p><p>Future Intel generations of chips, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake, won’t have baked-on memory. “It’s not a good way to run the business, so it really is for us a one-off with Lunar Lake,” said Gelsinger on Intel’s Q3 2024 earnings call, as spotted <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-panther-lake-to-launch-in-second-half-of-2025-no-more-memory-on-package-in-future-products">by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>. </p><p>“We’ll build it in a more traditional way with memory off-package, and the CPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off-package in the roadmap going forward,” he said.</p><p>It may seem a bit of a head-scratcher, because Intel touted Lunar Lake’s on-package memory as a competitive advantage when it came to laptop battery life — boasting that it reduced the power consumption of moving data through the system by 40 percent. </p><p>But on the earnings call, Gelsinger suggested that Lunar Lake was supposed to be more of an experiment, rather than the core of Intel’s laptop efforts it became: </p><div><blockquote><p>Lunar Lake was initially designed to be a niche product that we wanted to achieve highest performance and great battery life capability, and then AI PC occurred. And with AI PC, it went from being a niche product to a pretty high-volume product.</p></blockquote></div><p>Don’t we all want the best performance and battery life from our laptops? Perhaps — but Lunar Lake became a problem for Intel because it relied too much on external partners for the memory chips and wafers from rival TSMC. Last quarter, when Intel announced its mass layoffs and restructuring, Intel’s CFO revealed that Lunar Lake <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">was too costly to help turn Intel’s fortunes around</a>. Gelsinger says Lunar Lake hasn’t shipped 100 million units or anything like that, but it became “a meaningful portion of our total mix.”</p><p>Unfortunately for PC graphics enthusiasts, it seems like Intel’s discrete GPU efforts are similarly seen as a failed experiment now. Gelsinger says he’s focused on simplifying the company’s consumer products now, and dedicated graphics cards / chips are apparently on the chopping block. He said:</p><div><blockquote><p>How are we handling graphics? That is increasingly becoming large, integrated graphics capabilities, so less need for discrete graphics in the market going forward. </p></blockquote></div><div><p>If Intel axes them, it won’t come as a huge surprise — its gaming graphics initiative <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650611/intel-raja-koduri-gpus-amd-nvidia-apple-leave-ai-startup">only had very limited success</a> with standalone cards, and only ever managed to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911902/intel-arc-a580-announcement-performance-price-nvidia-amd">at the ultra-budget end</a> of the field, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">AMD is now threatening even more</a>.</p></div><p>But it’d be a bit of a shame if Intel never manages to get past the letter A — Alchemist — and the gamers waiting for Intel’s Battlemage dGPUs never manage to see its sophomore effort. At least Intel’s Arc graphics efforts, including Battlemage, did trickle down to the increasingly powerful integrated graphics aboard its laptop chips. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
