          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the second crossover, it's with indie sensation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a>. A Balatro-inspired trinket for Naoe and an amulet for Yasuke, both called "Winning Hand," have been added via the update. The items sport a legendary perk that has a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders. Ubisoft, however, isn't simply giving aways the new item. The patch notes state players will need to "work together to figure out how to get it" but doesn't offer any other clues, so let the hunt begin.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side of things, update 1.0.5 brings some welcome improvements to the Assassin's Creed Shadows' parkour. A new vertical jump option has been added, allowing players to jump up to nearby ledges or awnings without having to wall-run. Other additions include the option to make it so sprint no longer disengages when parkouring up or down, as well as enhanced distance and height for back and side ejects, making it easier for Naoe to keep to the rooftops.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from bug fixes, the other major additions via update 1.0.5 are new photo mode features (like the ability to change the time of day and toggle headgear on or off). Assassin's Creed Shadows' preorder quest, Thrown to the Dogs, is now also unlocked for all players, and revolves around helping a loyal canine companion avenge his master. Completing the quest unlocks the Tsuki-maru pet that can be placed in the game's hideout. The full Assassin's Creed Shadows patch notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.0.5 is just the latest addition to Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft having already detailed what's next for the open-world RPG as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>. An Assassin's Creed Shadows update earlier this month added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-assassins-creed-shadows-update-announced-adds-new-story-mission-and-fixes-a-deer-problem/1100-6531312/" data-ref-id="1100-6531312">new story pack</a>, with updates planned for later this year set to introduce new game plus, additional free story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h2>PATCH SIZES:</h2><ul><li>PS5: ~3.31 GB</li><li>XBS: ~19 GB</li><li>MAC: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~13 GB</li><li>Steam: ~4.3 GB</li></ul><h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h2>"Thrown to the Dogs" Quest Unlocked</h2><p>With this update, all players will receive access to the pre-order bonus quest, "Thrown to the Dogs". Help a loyal dog avenge his late master and unlock Tsuki-maru as a pet to place in your Hideout.</p><p>The quest is available in early game, once you have completed "From Spark to Flame". It can be found at the Tennoji Temple, outside of Osaka.</p><h2>SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS</h2><h2>Dead By Daylight Event</h2><p>We're excited to unveil our first special collaboration with this new Dead by Daylight event coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p><em>As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat...</em></p><p>This event comes with a new free quest that you can access from the Hideout upon unlocking Yasuke as a playable character. Once the event is completed, you will obtain a free trinket and banner.</p><p>You will also be able to further personalize your two characters with a Dead by Daylight-inspired pack in the store, featuring outfits, weapons, trinkets, and the chance to ride off into the shadows with none other than the loyal steed, Maurice.</p><h3>Balatro Trinket</h3><p>We are also adding a new trinket for Naoe, and an amulet for Yasuke called "Winning Hand" -- directly inspired by Balatro. These new items come with a legendary perk that gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders.</p><p>Now... you will need to work together to figure out how to get it!</p><h2>PARKOUR IMPROVEMENTS</h2><p>The team has prepared a bunch of improvements to enhance the parkour mechanics. We want to give a big thank you to all our dedicated parkour players for their ongoing feedback since launch.</p><p>Here are the main changes:</p><h3>New Vertical Jump</h3><p>We're adding a brand-new parkour interaction allowing both Naoe and Yasuke to jump and grab any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall-runs. To trigger it, simply press the jump button as you approach low overhangs, and your character will make the jump.</p><h3>Sprint Toggle Lock</h3><p>As long as the directional inputs are maintained, sprint no longer disengages when using Parkour Up or Parkour Down.</p><h2>Enhanced Back and Side Ejects</h2><p>We've also enhanced the distance and height of side &amp; back ejects, favoring foot landings over hand landings. This includes new animations for Naoe when performing height-gaining side ejects, extending her capacity to remain high-up during parkour.</p><h2>NEW PHOTO MODE FEATURES</h2><p>Photo Mode is receiving its biggest update for an Assassin's Creed game, with the addition of new features to better customize your shots and make the most out of capturing the beauty of Feudal Japan.</p><p>These include the following options:</p><ul><li>Change the time of day</li><li>Play around with numerous poses and facial expressions</li><li>Toggle headgear on/off</li><li>Play music while editing your shots</li><li>Sticker colorization</li><li>New customization frames</li><li>Save Custom Filters</li><li>Reset only one parameter</li><li>Tweak camera speed</li><li>Improved preview mode</li><li>Fullscreen (PC only)</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoy these new customization options! Don't hesitate to share your new Photo Mode shots online using #ACPhotoMode for a chance to be featured on our social media channels (@AssassinsCreed).</p><h2>LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed the issue where players had a persistent New Item notification in their inventory. <em>We did it!</em></li><li>Addressed an issue where some players were given a new save file at level 60, with gear and all objectives uncovered.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the desynchronization warning for 'killing civilians' would appear without any reason.</li><li>Fixed an issue where romancing Lady Oichi before romancing Rin could cause a breakup.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h3>Balancing</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Samurai Daisho and Ronin occasionally gave an extremely high amount of Mon regardless of their level, disincentivizing other methods of gaining Mon.</li><li>We have also partially rebalanced the Mon economy to encourage more world exploration and gameplay activities to earn Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources instead of purchasing them through merchants.</li><li>In pursuit of this, we've bumped up the cost of Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources sold by Merchants and lowered the quantity available each season for each Merchant.</li><li>If you still want to purchase them, we've increased the amount of Mon acquired from completing contracts.</li></ul><h3>World</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Yagoro would become trapped in a Kofun and not return to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could remain stuck inside the construction site at Osaka Castle.</li></ul><h3>Quests</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not exit the quest "Vision of Realms" if they selected 'Quit to Memories' and loaded their progress from the Animus Memories menu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where quitting during the "Nobutsuna Sensei" quest caused Yasuke to become stuck in the flashback.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yaya doesn't join "The League" after being successfully recruited.</li><li>Fixed progress issues in the "Showdown in Sakamoto" quest that happened if Katsuhime previously died.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wake Up Call" quest where the "troublemaker" couldn't be hunted down.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Find Local Dishes" quest where Narezushi could not be obtained from merchants.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wolves and Foxes" quest where players were not able to speak with Hattori Hanzo. <em>I guess we'll let you talk to him now.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in "A Peculiar Guest".</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Missing Missive" quest due to being unable to retrieve the letter.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would crash during the "Temple of the Horseman (An Eye for an Eye)" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest where Katsuhime's letter would sometimes disappear. <em>You got mail!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where the game incorrectly believed Katsuhime was dead and players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Naoe and Katsuhime being attached to surrounding water. <em>They just wanted to go on a little swim!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Katsuhime dropping into the water and swimming to shore.</li></ul><h3>Stealth</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Shinobi Bell effect was blocked by line of sight from NPCs.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><ul><li>Adjusted an issue where the +600% affliction buildup engravings was a text error.

It’s slim, charges fast, and has a built-in USB-C cable so you can leave the tangled mess at home. At $26.99, it’s a solid pickup. On the other hand, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LvR?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>UGREEN USB-C to USB Adapter 4 Pack</strong></a> is perfect for those moments when you need to plug a USB-A gadget into your laptop or phone—super handy and only $6.98.

It’s a 1:1 replica straight from the TV show, complete with a screen that runs Fallout animations, an FM radio, and a working clock. At $199.99, it’s a bit of a splurge, but man, if you’re a fan, it’s the kind of thing that makes you stop and stare every time you walk past it.

Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays.

Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing.

A Chapter based on Scott Cawthon’s legendary animatronic horror series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-is-finally-getting-a-five-nights-at-freddys-killer-and-hes-voiced-by-matthew-lillard">will finally, officially arrive in Dead by Daylight</a> June 17, marking the end of a long wait and the beginning of another year of more crossovers, quality-of-life fixes, and more. It’s a collaboration years in the making, and we got a first look at how it’s shaping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN sat down to interview Dead by Daylight Creative Director Dave Richard and Killer Designer Jason Guzzo ahead of the upcoming Chapter’s public test build (PTB), which launches today at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET, to learn more about how this latest collaboration stays true to the looks and lore of Five Nights at Freddy’s. Alongside learning more about how the new Killer, Springtrap, uses doors, cameras, and jump scares to terrorize Survivors, our chat revealed more details about some of the other horror icons Behaviour would love to add and exactly how much Markiplier they watched to prepare for the new update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eager Nintendo Switch 2 fans will also be happy to know that Behaviour confirmed with IGN separately that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-every-nintendo-switch-game-with-compatibility-issues-on-nintendo-switch-2">Dead by Daylight's startup issues on the device</a> will be resolved by the time the new console launches next week, June 5. Meanwhile, the team has an explanation behind why they opted out of including a new Survivor this time around, but if we’re lucky, Freddy Fazbear’s time in Dead by Daylight is just getting started.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/dbd-ketchup-ch36-character-art-killer-vf-dynamicpose-1920x1080-1748353673542.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Springtrap comes to Dead by Daylight. Image provided by Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Heading into the PTB, how are you feeling about how Springtrap looks and feels to play compared to other past Killers in previous PTBs.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dave Richard:</strong> Jason will be able to answer that in more details, because, of course, he's the main designer on this. I feel excited. I feel confident. We know that this is the top-requested franchise and Killer. It has been for many, many years, so a little bit stressed as well. There's a lot of hype, there's a lot of expectation, but the team did great to be authentic and to create a very, very cool Five Nights at Freddy's experience within the Dead by Daylight metrics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Guzzo:</strong> I mean, I think Dave put it pretty well, I have not been at behavior for 23 years and on DBD since the beginning, so I think my stress is a little higher than his. For him, it's like, 'Oh, this is just part of the, part of the flow.' But for me, this is, this is my third Killer. So yes, I did Chucky and Dracula previously, but being able to kind of be trusted with FNaF on DBD was so awesome. I'm really excited about it. It takes us almost a year to do a Killer, so it's really cool to finally be able to say, like, 'Oh, here's what we're doing,' and everybody can see it and play with it and let us know... hopefully their view on it aligns with ours, and hopefully they love it as much as we did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Just reading over some of the details I saw beforehand, this seems so authentic to Five Nights at Freddy's and what the gameplay is in that series, which I didn't expect. I didn't expect to see doors, cameras, and even jump scares. Were there discussions about playing as other animatronics, or was it always Springtrap the team had their eyes on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Obviously, it's not something we can answer easily on, like, all the inner workings that we have with our different partners. There were many, many iterations of what this Chapter could be, and we ended up here, and it's great, and that's all I can share.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is the first time players get to play a spring trap in a video game, which I'm sure for the Five Nights at Freddy's community is huge. Can you talk about what it's like creating original gameplay for this character with such a limited blueprint to base things off of?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> That's a great question. Really, like, as you implied, the gameplay from FNaF is very different from DBD - drastically different. So really, the goal was to say, 'What's the experience of FNaF? What the - my favorite word in the whole world - what's the vibe? That's the millennial word: 'What's the vibe?' So, I mean, I watched, no joke, about 70 hours of content. I won't name names, but the king of FNaF. Everybody knows who it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Shoutout to Markiplier. Yeah!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> [Laughs] I mean, I love him now. I hadn't really watched him before, and now I've watched so much of his FNaF stuff, and I'm subscribed. I watch all of his new videos and stuff. It won me over. But no, it was really cool to be able to kind of see, not only just the gameplay. I'm going to be honest: I don't love jump scares as a player. I love horror movies. Horror games with jump scares... I'm a bit of a baby about it, but it was cool to not only just watch the gameplay, but watch, of course, the streamers' reactions and the people playing it in the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you watch people playing live, you see the community interacting. Also, just seeing what people react to... because you can make a game like FNaF, and you go, 'Oh, it's all going to be jump scares,' and people just kind of ignore that, and they kind of focus on something else. So, being able to watch somebody play, and watch people play, and read all the lore - because Five Nights at Freddy's lore is crazy - and just say like, 'Well, what are people reacting to, and how can we kind of adapt that to into the context of DBD?' There was a lot of back and forth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a lot of cooks in this kitchen on this Chapter because everybody has ideas for FNaF. It's the big one. Everybody wanted to make sure that it was as authentic as possible, and, of course, everything went through Mr. Scott Cawthon. So, yeah, it was really cool to do all that research and take a ton of notes and say, 'What can we mess with and what can we do, and how can we enhance DBD with a flavor - or with the vibe - and the experience of FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I have to jump back to the very start of that question, when you talk about the announcement and how people reacted. I had the chance to reveal it was Springtrap at PAX, and in that room there was almost 1000 people, and they shouted so loud that the floor was shaking. It was just... it just amazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's super exciting and a big moment for everyone right now. I spoiled it a little bit, but can you guys give me more detail about what players can expect from Springtrap in the PTB, a little more specifically? How does your version of this Killer and that new map do the character justice?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Jason, that's all for you. I just want to say real quick that, going back to your previous question, you know, the task that the team had was quite challenging. To distill that vibe and to have the mechanics of a single-player experience where you're the Survivor transformed into that duality, that you can create that fear, or you can experience it in another kind of way, in a very different kind of game. Before we jump into the mechanics of it, absolutely, we wanted jump scares. That's part of the vibe. Absolutely we wanted to create these moments of hunting corridors and of surveillance. Then the thing I'm really happy about, and Jason, you'll be able to describe, but that whole door thing was not an afterthought, but it was a thing that you came up with afterwards, and it made it through, and it's absolutely brilliant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> Wow. The creative director, calling me brilliant [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> You can end the interview now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> [Laughs] So, he is primarily a projectile Killer. The power kind of comes in two flavors. There's two halves of it. I'm gonna attempt to ramble and go on tangents a little bit, but I promise I'll get to where I need to be in a second. One of the things that I wanted to do with this one was, as mentioned, FNaF is like a Survivor game, right? In the context of DBD, you're playing from the Survivor's point of view. You're sitting in the security office, and you're managing the battery, and you are trying not to get yourself killed. So, I wanted to kind of step back and say, 'How can we enhance the Survivor side of the gameplay for this Chapter?' Because that's kind of what people know from FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, we couldn't just say, 'Oh yeah, all four people stand still and open and close doors and manage a battery' - that's not DBD. What we came upon was the idea of, 'Well, the security doors, they're pretty iconic, and obviously the security office is super iconic.' Where we landed was that the security office is this transitional space for both Survivors and Killers. There are doors that are spawned around the map. Each has a camera and a number. So, you know kind of which camera is which or which door is which.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survivors, when they interact with the door, they're given the camera view with the battery, and they see the little map of the cameras in the corner. You can flip through them, see what's on the other side of any door. If you find a door that you like, if it looks safe on the other side, or if you're going to save somebody, or whatever it is, you can hit our input and you get a little canned animation, almost like a cinematic. It's not pre-rendered or anything, but it's very hands-off. I kind of equate it to a super short theme park ride, where you see, in first-person, your Survivor walks through the security office and looks around, and it's spooky. Then the door opens on the other end of the room, and you leave, and then now you're on, potentially, the other side of the map. It's basically a teleport, but it's very thematic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/dbd-ketchup-ch36-character-art-killer-vf-marketingpose-1920x1080-1748353727087.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Springtrap wielding his pizza knife. Image provided by Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick here is that even though it's a safe space - or it feels like a safe space - it is not. The Killer doesn't have access to the cameras but can enter the doors and can look around at any of the other doors he likes and teleport to it. He gets the same thing: He gets kind of a movement through the security office, but if his path happens to cross paths with a Survivor, they get a little jump scare, and he grabs them, and he walks out of the door, carrying them. It feels really thematic, and the animation is so good. It's so good. The anim team killed it. The first thing I said was, 'Can we do a grab Killer?' We have melee and M1 Killers. We have range Killers. Can we just do a Killer that's all based around grabs? Because grabs in DBD are inherently kind of jump scares. We wanted to lean into that a little bit. Obviously, it's not the only thing you can do - that'd be kind of boring - but we did lean into those kinds of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the other half of his power is his projectile. He has a big old fire axe that he can lob. It's a very unique arc. It's not like anything we've ever done with a projectile Killer before. It's not built for sniping. It's not designed around sniping. It's not balanced around sniping. It's really to do some really gnarly trick shots, and we've already had some people pulling off some crazy things internally. It's been really fun to watch. We wanted to marry those two things with the door gameplay, and 'How can we expand on that, and how can we expand on this idea of him being the grab Killer?' One of the things that we did is, if you hit a Survivor with your projectile, you can chase them down, and you hit M1, and really, I mean, it's a thematic thing. We're basically just skipping a step. Normally, they would fall down, and you would pick them up, but we're doing that all in one shot. You get in close, and you hit your basic attack, and Springtrap very violently grabs the axe, spins you around, you get a nice little jump scare animation, and then he's carrying you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The axe functions in a couple of different ways: He can disable cameras and doors and get a little bit of an AoE with stuff, but that's all my tangents to describe the whole Power. We really did our best to be as authentic as possible when it came to both sides of the aisle, so to speak, when it comes to the Survivor experience of using these cameras and sneaking through these doors and seeing the security office and still being this menacing, lumbering beast. You can't even call him a man or a robot. He's a monster, right? We tried to be as authentic as possible in making him feel like he's both pretty stompy and loud, but also can show up right behind you and - Boo! You know what I mean? [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's going to be really interesting to see Springtrap marry Five Nights at Freddy's into Dead by Daylight itself. When you guys were coming up with ideas for Springtrap, was the upcoming Five Nights at Freddy's 2 movie something the team had to keep in consideration? Was Behaviour able to pull any elements from that film or the first film when creating its version of its character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Great question, and the answer is no. Actually, it was all about, for us, the classic experience of the game, especially the first titles, that we wanted to recreate. We often go for that in Dead by Daylight, as you can see. We go for the classics. What creates a little bit of nostalgia as well, and then make it more modern, or whatever it requires to be in Dead by Daylight in today's flavor. Of course, the movie was out, the first installment, and it is also based a lot on that aspect, with some changes, but we were really focused on the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, at what point during conversations with Scott Cawthon, did you both say we've got to get Matthew Lillard in here for this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> It actually came directly from Scott. We had discussion about the different outfits that we could create for Springtrap. It's a discussion we have with partners all the time, like, 'What's your comfort level? We want to respect that. Do you want us to create new outfits like the Blight, or do you want to keep to the specific? Do we have the rights to this and that,' etc., and he actually suggested it. We were thinking, 'We have to stick to the games,' and he said, 'Oh, we absolutely need the Yellow Rabbit from the movie. That would be awesome.' Like, f**k yeah. Yeah, it would. Then having, on top of that, Matthew Lillard's participation and being able to - I didn't personally hang out with him - but part of the team did, and he's just fantastic to work with. He's done fantastic work on making this character alive in our game. It's just awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> I mean, he's an icon, right?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Is Coming to Dead by Daylight - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A horror icon in the game, portraying this massive character.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah, I mean, if you if you squint... maybe you're Shaggy [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moving over to a different topic now, I've seen some express disappointment that this next Chapter doesn't come with a Survivor. Can you talk about whether there were ever conversations about including a Survivor and why you ultimately chose not to include one this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So, in early discussion in our planning, and how we wanted to tackle this Chapter and what we had access to when we started this, having a Survivor was, for many reasons, challenging and not a perfect fit that we wanted to make happen. So, yes, I understand the disappointment, like, 100%, but in our mind, we were in the first game, where, at that point in the story, security is anyone. It's the player. It's you, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that this evolves in the FNaF timeline to something else, but that's kind of the vibe we're going for. I'd like to say... maybe we'll get the chance to do it eventually, or do something else. I definitely think that would be really cool, especially [knowing that] FNaF is vast. It's a large franchise, and that's something we've done before, with big licenses. We've done more content after the first release. So, maybe that would be a possibility. That'd be cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dead by Daylight will let players freely run and hide around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. Without spoilers, can you talk about some of the details in the map that you're proud of and excited to see players uncover in the PTB?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> The map is truly amazing. It's one of those buildings that we faithfully recreated, of course, in the metrics of Dead by Daylight. It's comparable to [Raccoon City Police Station] as in it exists. It's something that players already lived in some ways, without necessarily roaming around in that fashion. Being able to do so and to see that in the contemporary fashion and the DBD style is a lot of fun. We've packed it with surprise, and yeah, I'm not spoiling anything, but there's a lot of you know hints about the lore of FNaF, about cool moments that happen. There are some extra jump scares in there. There's a lot of a little surprises like this. You know, we aim to delight with this level of detail, and this one serves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw Behaviour mention in another interview that it took some time to make the Five Nights at Freddy's collaboration happen for so many different reasons. Part of what took so long involved a desire from both Cawthon and the Dead by Daylight team to establish what was important and how to please fans on both sides. Can you talk about what that process was like and which elements took the longest to nail down?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I can't, I can't answer this. I don't have the knowledge of it. If [Game Director Mathieu Cote] was here, you would be able to say so. But usually, we don't also talk about the process with partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is the collaboration fans have wanted to see for so long. How do you feel about the reception so far, and what is it like for the team specifically to finally give this to players who have been asking for it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> What else can you say other than it's amazing? Obviously, people are, I don't want to say nervous, but there's always a bit of trepidation when you work hard on something, and then you're putting it out into the world. We all know people on the internet have opinions, but overall, we're all really excited. We've been staring at this for, you know, 40-plus hours a week for almost a year, and we've played it to death. We're just excited to, not necessarily even see how people feel about it, because, you know, you're never going to make everybody happy, but more like, see how people explore it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Springtrap Is Dead by Daylight's Newest Killer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a game designer, I like to approach my designs as like… I want to give you tools to play with and figure out and kind of make your own moment-to-moment. That's a big thing that we talk about with DBD a lot - those moment-to-moment... moments. Those moments that you talk with your friends about. 'Oh, do remember when that happened, and this happened,’ etc, etc. So, we really wanted to make sure that, like I said, with like the extra Survivor gameplay, we wanted to give players the tools to really have a lot of those super fun, cool moments and the jump scares and the laughs. That's the best part; when we do a play test and I'm sitting and watching people play and they're laughing and s**t-talking each other, that's when I know I've succeeded, personally. As soon as people don't talk about bugs or whatever, because, you know, bugs come up, and they're just focused on having fun and laughing and calling each other names and everybody's joking around... that's when the magic happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's cool to see it internally, and then when we put it out there, go on Twitch or YouTube or whatever it is, and just watching people have those moments on kind of a much bigger scale. So yeah, the team is super excited, obviously. We've also been waiting to do this for 10 years, right? It's not just the community that's been waiting for it. We've been waiting to do it. So, it's cool that we're finally able to do it, and we can kind of bring that to the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I've been there a little bit longer, obviously, on the project, and I was talking with other colleagues yesterday, and they actually asked a similar question. They're like, 'Well, OK, so now you've done it. What's next? Is this the top?' Then, I was reflecting, I'm like, 'Well, pretty much every Chapter we do in, the latest and greatest is the most important thing we're working on.' I understand that FNaF is huge, and it's been highly requested, and after it, there's going to be a new top request, and there's still a lot of universes to explore. Either they're original or they're licenses, so this will happen again. We're definitely not done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When did Five Nights at Freddy's first come up as a topic for you guys, where you said 'We'd love to have this in Dead by Daylight.'</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> For me, I wouldn't be able to target the year exactly, but I didn't know Markiplier, and I was actually... this is a long story. I'm going to try and make it short. So, I wasn't watching a lot of streamers, and a colleague just said, 'Oh, you should look at the videos that Markiplier does. He's really funny.' Of course, I watched FNaF videos, and this is where I actually learned a lot about FNaF, that I was really interested in the franchise, that I learned about Markiplier. I had a lot of fun with it, and it triggered this idea, and this want. Then it really solidified when the community started asking for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, it wasn't even necessarily like everybody was clamoring for Five Nights at Freddy's. It almost started just from organically seeing Markiplier.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I have to say that this is a very personal view on the matter. Of course, what I do on the project, I look around on anything horror to get inspired by it. So, I can't say that when I saw Markiplier play, it was like, 'Yes, this needs to be in DBD, and the power should be like that.' Absolutely not because it was very early on, and DBD at that point was... what's the word. We were less on the team, and of course, big things like FNaF were not necessarily as possible, but when it crystallized into something that we needed to do, it definitely was because the community was asking for it. Yes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there a crossover that members of the Dead by Daylight team would love to see happen? NO restraints.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> There’s a few that Mathieu Cote already said that we like to say because they’re kind of obvious. You know, Pennywise would be amazing. There are other kings of horror that would be amazing to have. You could guess any one of them, I’m thinking. Frankly, I just want to collect them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> Dave treats DBD like Pokémon [laughs]. Just to be clear, this isn’t a hint about something that is being worked on. As far as I know, it’s not something that is being discussed above me, but my dream – and probably my favorite horror movie – is the obvious one: The Thing. I would love to get The Thing into DBD. I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into DBD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has a lot of potential design problems. It’s an internal thing of trying to figure out how to make that character work, but yes, that would be my… I don’t want to say my dream Chapter because every Chapter has been a dream so far. I got to do Chucky and Dracula and Springtrap. I don’t know who on this team gets to talk about being on some of the biggest licenses on the planet, but The Thing is the one that I am on a crusade to get done at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> That’s really cool. Yeah, it’d be a nice one. The other ones that we always share, too… they could be mostly a joke, but I think there’s a way to make it work, especially now in the timeline: Cujo. Christine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A popular theory floating around about an upcoming Chapter involves some faded letters on a recent roadmap you published. Have you seen this theory floating around, and is there any chance we could get you to comment on it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard: </strong>I haven’t seen it. I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to add about the upcoming PTB, Five Nights at Freddy’s, or the future of Dead by Daylight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard: </strong>So many things. Jason, I’ll let you start. It’s your baby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo: </strong>We love this game. We love the franchise. If you love FNaF, we want you to feel welcome to coming into DBD and seeing what we have to offer. I’m going to be honest: It might not be the Chapter that you think it is. I think it being so requested and so loved by the community for so long that there have been… trust me, I did the research, there is a lot of really interesting and cool community concepts on how we could have done FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> And we can only do one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> And we can only do one, and obviously I’m not just going to be like, ‘Oh, this guy, JoeSmith123 on Reddit has a really good idea, let’s just steal that.’ It might not be the Chapter you expected, but know that we went in not just to make something that, like, ‘Oh this is like the big one. We’re going to sell a million – a billion billion billion copies of this DLC,’ or whatever. We went in wanting to be as authentic as possible and, with Survivors having a little bit extra gameplay in this Chapter, we really wanted to make sure we were authentic to the franchise but also honor the community of that game, and make sure they understand that, when you come to DBD, you might recognize the faces, but you’re going to get a new experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hope everybody likes it. I genuinely do. I don’t do this because it’s an easy job. I don’t do this because it’s glamorous – although I get to do an interview with IGN, I guess that’s pretty glamorous to be honest [laughs] in terms of being a game dev – but I do it because I love horror. I’ve been a horror fan my whole life. Working on a horror game is very literally a dream come true, even though, as mentioned before, I don’t really like playing scary games because I’m a big baby, but I love working on them and I love the genre. I try to watch new horror movies two or three times I week, and my wife has to also watch them, too bad for her [laughs]. Just understand that this is coming from a place of love and a place of respect as much as possible. I hope everybody loves it. I hope everybody loves playing it as much as I loved working on it. I think that’s the best way I can put it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Good stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

As you might have guessed, the studio is always thinking about the next Killers and Survivors it can add to its lineup. What you might not know, though, is that some members of the team have their sights set on specific names.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into Dead by Daylight.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Killer Designer and horror aficionado Jason Guzzo has helped bring infamous Killers, such as Chucky, Dracula, and Springtrap, into the Entity’s world in the past. Any crossover marks an important moment for Behaviour and its fans, but Guzzo says the one franchise he’d bend over backward to make happen is The Thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as I know, it’s not something that is being discussed above me, but my dream – and probably my favorite horror movie – is the obvious one: The Thing,” Guzzo said. “I would love to get The Thing into [Dead by Daylight]. I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into Dead by Daylight.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Springtrap Is Dead by Daylight's Newest Killer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Guzzo reiterates that his desire to work on a The Thing Chapter isn’t a hint at what’s to come, and there are a few factors that might keep such a collaboration from ever materializing. He acknowledges the “potential design problems” that come along with creating a playable video game version of what is essentially a complicated mimic murderer. That said, it’s still the one series he is “on a crusade to get done at some point.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead by Daylight Creative Director Dave Richard, meanwhile, points out that conversations about dream Killers are nothing new for the Behaviour team. While a name like Pennywise comes up as one villain he feels would “be amazing,” Richard doesn’t want to stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are other kings of horror that would be amazing to have,” Richard tells us. “You could guess any one of them, I’m thinking. Frankly, I just want to collect them all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are obviously many monsters who have yet to appear in Dead by Daylight, but some of the not-so-obvious names have come up in discussions, too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frankly, I just want to collect them all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other ones that we always share, too,” Richard added, “they could be mostly a joke, but I think there’s a way to make it work, especially now in the timeline: Cujo. Christine.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cujo, of course, is the titular rabid dog from Stephen King’s novel and its 1983 movie adaptation. A dog Killer would be quite out of character for a game that primarily features human characters like Ghost Face and Michael Myers, but it’s not exactly impossible. Richard’s reference to King’s Christine, meanwhile, would see a killer car join the roster if Behaviour could ever figure out how to make it work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If one thing is for sure, it’s that Dead by Daylight is showing no signs of slowing down as its barrels toward its ninth anniversary. The Five Nights at Freddy’s Chapter will officially launch come June 17, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-is-finally-getting-a-five-nights-at-freddys-killer-and-hes-voiced-by-matthew-lillard">adding Springtrap and a pizzeria map into the fold</a>.

That effort proved successful in the long run as the company watched more of its video game-playing userbase adopt mobile as their primary platform of choice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you're able to do that, suddenly Discord gets better for gaming, planning the night with your friends, and then afterwards—sharing the emotions and things like that," he added. "I think what what you'll hear us talk about sometimes is that Discord is the best place to talk and hang out before, during, and after a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A happier and more engaged mobile audience drove what Sellis and Vishnevskiy said was the core of Discord's monetization strategy: Discord Nitro. The monthly subscription service—which offers users advanced server tools, customization options, and larger file uploads—is the center of the company's plans to monetize its free-to-play app.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was slightly surprising, as other chat apps and social platforms have preferred to prioritize advertising over subscription services. But the pair said all the other features the company has rolled out, like the Discord Shop, are downstream of Nitro subscriptions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sellis said there are three predictors for if Discord users will subscribe to Nitro: the time they spend in Discord, the time they spend in voice chat, and the number of their friends have Nitro subscriptions. And it turns out those with Nitro subscriptions are the ones spending money in the Discord shop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's a very strong indicator that we're incentive-compatible with our users," said Sellis. So if the shop isn't meant to monetize free users, what is? That would be the quest system—an unusual form of advertising that an audience of players responds to better than the broader public.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How will Discord monetize if it goes public?">How will Discord monetize if it goes public?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we follow those threads to a possible future, Discord's post-IPO revenue strategy will likely be based on a carrot-and-stick approach to get more users on Nitro. The carrot would be to beefing up Nitro's offerings—possibly with incentives offered by game developers. The stick would be to eroding the features available to free Discord users and lock them behind a Nitro paywall (the aforementioned enshittification).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Sellis' theory holds up, then the company's best path forward is to nudge users to spend more time in voice chat, and to connect them with users subscribed to Nitro.

            <p>
As someone who's never played a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> game, seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year confused me simply because I didn't know it was a prequel. I generally prefer to play things in release order, but I understand why Square Enix did it that way around, and why they subsequently announced a double remake of the first two games. The third one launched just last November, leaving 1 and 2 with a vague 2025 release window. Well, until today, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared that the pair of remakes will be launching October 30th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While the first couple of Dragon Quests are technically available on modern platforms like the Nintendo Switch and mobile, you can't actually get them on PC. That means when the remakes launch it'll be the first time any of us in computer land can play them (officially speaking, of course). As mentioned I've not played any of them, just a series I've not gotten to yet, but neither of them are meant to be very long (hence the packaging of them together), so this doesn't seem like the worst way to tackle them.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I know this shouldn't be treated as the definitive way to play them, I just also don't always get along with the rough edges of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. These'll likely have sanded off said edges, and that's just fine with me, I'll leave all that stat min-maxing to all you sickos out there.
</p>
<p>
There's also a version of the game coming aptly titled the Erdrick Trilogy which combines all three remakes together, if you've not picked the third one up yet. And if you own the full trilogy, you'll get a, uh, dog suit to wear in Dragon Quest 1, and a cat suit to wear in Dragon Quest 2. Sure!

With each new entry in the collection, <em>Mission: Impossible </em>filmmakers seem to make it their goal to put Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team in a maze of interconnected circumstances that seem, at the very least, improbable to get out of. But some of those missions really stood out more in their levels of complexity and impossibility.</p><p>This past week we’ve ranked everything from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-ethan-haircut-best-hair-long-mi2-1851782046?_gl=1*1fxp5wi*_ga*MTg1MDcxNDczNy4xNzQyMTU1ODM5*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNTgyMzkkbzEyNSRnMCR0MTc0ODM1ODIzOSRqNjAkbDAkaDAkZElMUXVjM05HaUdyQXR1dF9RSVM3RWpIR0hTTFJPM0RraEE.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-ethan-haircut-best-hair-long-mi2-1851782046?_gl=1*1fxp5wi*_ga*MTg1MDcxNDczNy4xNzQyMTU1ODM5*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNTgyMzkkbzEyNSRnMCR0MTc0ODM1ODIzOSRqNjAkbDAkaDAkZElMUXVjM05HaUdyQXR1dF9RSVM3RWpIR0hTTFJPM0RraEE.">Tom Cruise’s hair</a></span> in each movie to the franchise’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537">most irreplaceable characters</a></span>. In honor of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244"><em>The Final Reckoning</em></a></span><em> </em> dominating the Memorial Day Weekend box offices, we decided to take a different look at the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise by ranking the movies based on the impossibility of the mission. So, before you scream about Phillip Seymour Hoffman being a better villain than any other <em>Mission: Impossible </em>bad guy, or how Tom Cruise didn’t risk his life falling backwards off a helicopter for <em>Fallout </em>not to be the best movie ever, remember, it’s all about the mission, even if you don’t choose to accept it. </p></div></div><div><p>Not only is it the worst <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, it’s also the least impossible mission. Rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) wants to infect the world with the highly contagious Chimera virus, in order to profit from selling the cure. To stop him, Ethan Hunt has to break into Biocyte Pharmaceuticals’ high-security lab. Hunt recruits Ambrose’s ex, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), to seduce the villain into uncovering his plan, where she makes a heroic move, injecting herself with the last vial of Chimera to prevent its being unleashed.</p><p>That leaves Hunt with a 72-hour deadline, before the virus in Nordoff-Hall becomes irreversible, and while that does add a level of suspense, this was very much Mission: Difficult. Given the challenges described over the next seven entries, you’ll see what made this mission feel so pedestrian in hindsight.</p></div><div><p>To me, this is the best <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie ever. No other film in the franchise is as grounded with as many powerhouse performances as this action masterpiece. However, in terms of mission impossibility, it’s still pretty low. In the film, Hunt has 48 hours to retrieve a biotech weapon known as The Rabbit’s Foot and deliver it to Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) or risk this psychopath killing his wife. I’ll admit, Hunt sliding down the slanted glass roof of a skyscraper in order to kill all of the guards was badass, and parachuting into the Shanghai streets was insanely difficult. But, remember, this is an agent who has held his breath underwater for six minutes to swap security cards, jumped out of a plane on multiple occasions, and recently hopped into <em>two</em> planes in mid-air. The fact we don’t even see how he retrieved Rabbit’s Foot decreases the impossibility of the mission significantly. </p></div><div><p>Here’s the problem with <em>Dead Reckoning Part One</em>: The stakes of the film are cut in half. Sure, trying to stop a self-aware AI program known as The Entity that can digitally scrub people out of existence and trick a submarine into shooting itself is pretty impossible, especially when it has the capability of infiltrating Hunt’s communication systems to direct him away from his destination. However, the real stakes are reserved for the second part of the movie, <em>The Final Reckoning</em>.</p><p>The motorcycle jump off a cliff and onto a moving train, fist-fighting on the roof of said train, and almost dying numerous times is just to get a key are not nothing. But it’s still not really that impossible of a mission, especially considering what he’s done in the past.</p></div><div><p>The impossibility of <em>this </em>mission hinges heavily on one of the most iconic infiltration scenes in movie history. <em>Mission: Impossible</em> set the bar for the minimum acceptability of mission complexity, and most films have succeeded at exceeding it.</p><p>While trying to clear his name and unmask a mole in the IMF, Hunt has to silently descend from a ceiling into the most secure vault in America, inside CIA headquarters, to retrieve a list of secret agent identities. Since this first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> relied less on death-defying stunts and advanced CGI, the 1996 film leaned more into human-engineered suspense. The vault is pressure and temperature sensitive, so a droplet of sweat from Hunt’s forehead, running down his glasses, has to be caught  while he hangs from the ceiling to prevent it from hitting the ground. In fact, this mission should’ve failed five separate times. That’s a good sign an all-time impossible feat.</p></div><div><p>Increasing the impossibility of <em>Rogue</em>&nbsp;<em>Nation</em>’s mission is the fact this is the first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie where every facet of Hunt’s operation has been compromised from the beginning. Hunt and his crew have to prove the existence of The Syndicate, a mysterious super-network of former agents from various intelligence agencies, all of whom are presumed to be dead. And he has to do all this while being hunted by the CIA.</p><p>The U.S. government targeting Hunt is a frequent obstacle in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movies, but <em>Rogue Nation</em> is the first time the star also has to battle Solomon Lane (Sean Harris)—the smartest <em>Mission: Impossible </em>villain ever—and a team of agents nearly as skilled as he is. Unfortunately, the film’s big weakness—the global threat being more implied than imminent—knocks it down a few on the impossibility ranking.</p></div><div><p> In <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, Hunt and his team has to stop fanatical nuclear strategist Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has stolen nuclear launch codes and plans to trigger an annihilation that will force humanity into a rebirth. To prevent this, Hunt must scale the tallest building in the world, impersonate diplomats, survive a sandstorm chase and battle Hendricks inside a Russian missile control facility. Oh, and to make matters worse, the entire U.S. government has disavowed him and his team after Hendricks framed them of blowing up the fucking Kremlin in one of the most shocking moments in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> history.</p><p>The mission becomes even more impossible when Hendricks actually launches the missile towards San Francisco, and quickly becomes a ridiculous race down a cylindrical car garage to make a last-second effort to disable the bomb seconds before it makes impact. Given how close this came to disaster, the shifting nature of the goal, and the fact Hunt climbs the Burj Khalifa, this is one of the higher impossibility levels the franchise ha</p></div><div><p>Whenever Hunt can’t save the world by himself, the added variables increases the mission impossibility. In <em>Fallout</em>, Hunt and the IMF have to prevent a global nuclear catastrophe by disabling two synchronized nuclear bombs intended to poison one third of the world’s water supply. This is all made much more complicated, since if you disable one bomb too early, the other one explodes. One more wrinkle: Disabling both of them is only possible after destroying a remote detonator. And all of this has to be done within 15 minutes, while Hunt is twirling around in a helicopter fight, racing to secure said detonator. That doesn’t even factor in how he jumped out a plane in order to save an unconscious August Walker (Henry Cavill) mid-air, a double-agent implanted in Hunt’s operation to monitor him for the U.S. government, who is also sabotaging his mission for psychopath Solomon Lane. </p><p>Trusting his right-hand men Benji (Simon Pegg) and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283">Luther</a></span> (Ving Rhames) to guide him through a prison or off a cliff onto a moving train is one thing, but trusting them—along with his barely-trained wife Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan)—to disarm a bomb while he’s hundreds of miles away in the air is a different level. With all of that factored in, there really is only one other movie with a more impossible mission. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hunt and the IMF’s main obstacle in every <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie is usually time, but <em>The Final Reckoning </em>ramps this up to an all new level of anxiety. Our intrepid crew has to stop the evil AI The Entity from launching every country’s nuclear missiles, and to do this they need to let it enter a secure database, in order to trap it on a 5D hard drive. The catch? Grace (Hayley Atwell) has to snatch the hard drive the millisecond The Entity enters.</p><p>If she snatches it a millisecond too early, The Entity remains connected to cyberspace and the missiles launch. If she does it a millisecond too late, The Entity safely enters the secured location and the missiles launch. On top of that, Hunt has to insert poison pill malware in the source code module in order to trick The Entity  into thinking it’s in the secured database. In the blink of an eye, the world could be reduced to ashes.</p><p>The entire world was going to be destroyed if one woman wasn’t quick enough to snatch a hard drive with seemingly impossible precision. And this is while battling an AI program that was literally altering reality and recruiting people inches away from the President of the United States. Without question, the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise ended with its most impossible mission.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > tinyBuild [133 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tinybuild">tinyBuild</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Nikita Sozidar" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nikita-sozidar">Nikita Sozidar</a> have announced the <em><a title="Games > VOIN [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/voin">VOIN</a></em> Early Access update “<a title="Games > Permafrost" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/permafrost">Permafrost</a>,” which adds a “massive” new location, proper character progression, and more. It will launch in June. <span id="more-967326"></span></p><p><em>VOIN</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464530/VOIN/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Nikita Sozidar’s latest developer log:</p><h2><span>“Permafrost” Developer Log</span></h2><p><iframe title="VOIN - &quot;Permafrost&quot; Update Developer Log" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VTQo0c1y5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone, I’m Nikita, and for the past year-and-a-half, I’ve been <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>. Take a look.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>VOIN</em> is a first-person <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a> with <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> elements set in <a title="Genres > Open-World [635 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>-like levels. The game is about you being an unstoppable force of nature that wields metal as it weapon. The world is broken and you are its reckoning.</p><p><strong>Items and Affixes</strong></p><p>You kill monsters, you get loot, which is the game’s bread and butter. And instead of affixes that plainly increase random stats, I decided to focus only on impactful stuff that actually changes the way you play. For example, you might find a hammer called Bell Ringer, which summons ghostly bells that—when hit—damages everyone around.</p><p>Or another example, which I also like a lot—a really powerful scythe that literally tears reality as you swing leaving scars that emanate freezing aura—or should I say a cool aura. No I shouldn’t say that. But guess what? You can also combine those two items into one. Find the symbiosis station at the hub, read the instructions carefully—please—and boom you have dual wakizashis that poison everyone and summon fire tornadoes—that’s a thing. But enough of that let’s get to the next exciting thing.</p><p><strong>The World</strong></p><p>In the last major update, Thunderborn, I added a huge dungeon underneath the Cathedral of Veiled Lament. Now, though, I’m working on the game’s next major update called Permafrost. It features a new absolutely massive new location the Athenium of Thousand Names. Snow-covered mountains, ice giants, perpetual blizzards—this place does not offer a warm welcome, not at all.</p><p>One of the other major features of this update is proper character progression—finally! Journey to the Hall of Reflection and find the new tree of talents (yes, your talent tree is an actual tree). And not only that, while exploring you’ll be finding Soul Fruits, which you can attach to the tree and gain various bonuses—for example, the ability to sprint. And you can already play the talent tree update—right now.</p><p>Anyway the game is shaping up great and there are a lot more super exciting things coming. For example, a completely new character, completely new weapon types—spears daggers and more—and even quests.</p><p>All right guys, that’s it for me. Thank you very much and see you next time.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sign-ups are available now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>. <span id="more-967279"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via tinyBuild:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to world where danger lurks around every corner, yet one that always rewards curiosity and courage.</p><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is an immersive third-person open-world RPG created by a passionate team that values the essence of classic old-school RPGs and modern designs. Explore the lands of a once-prosperous island, hone your combat skills, and survive in the unforgiving realm of the Kingdom of the Seven.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rewarding World Exploration</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>‘s world is full of hidden treasures, underwater caves, side quests and bosses, and valuable loot. Some of these can be found with a treasure map, while others with pure luck. The game has no marker system, and quests won’t lead you by the hand. Rediscover the joy of exploration and let curiosity be your guide; the world promises rich rewards for those who dare to uncover its secrets.</li><li><strong>Deep Character Progression and World Evolution</strong> – Build your characters as you like with three different skill branches: <a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, Craftsmanship and War. Allocate your character’s attribute points and unlock passive bonuses by exploring the world. The social system makes your progression even more noticeable: As the hero’s skills grow, the world around him reacts differently. If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin, by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet.</li><li><strong>Rich Storytelling</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is set in the low-fantasy cruel medieval world. Make your path from abandoned lowlife to a marshal of fortunes, choose your side and forge alliances on your journey to discover the truth of who you really are.</li><li><strong>Methodical <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a> Combat</strong> – The combat system in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> allows players to use three different combat stances with unique combat styles for different weapons. You are not a Legendary powerful Hero by default in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>. You need to learn the ropes of becoming one! Learn to stand up for yourself by timing your attacks, using environments, and active skills. Invest in the War branch to become more skilled not just in numbers: attacks become more accurate and stronger, and you’ll learn more tricks. For example, you’ll be able to throw bottles from the ground to stun your opponents!</li><li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere</strong> – Players are encouraged to slow down and fully embrace the world around them. The richly detailed environment comes alive with a dynamic day-night cycle, shifting weather, and natural elements like wind that sways the trees. Ambient sounds—from the soft rustle of leaves to distant birdsong—enhance the immersion, while NPCs follow their own daily routines, adding to the sense of a living, breathing world. The result is an experience that wraps players in a comforting, tranquil atmosphere, inviting them to linger and explore at their own pace.</li><li><strong>When Classic Meets Modern</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is a game for everyone from hardcore RPG fans to casual players. It is inspired by classic old-school RPGs and combines the convenience of modern gaming while paying homage to the legendary classic <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing games</a>. There are no quest markers or enemy auto-levelling, but there’s modern user interface, environment markers, tutorials, and much more.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>World Overview Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - World Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qICLoFcoSdo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"And, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020818363924598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later message</a>, NetherRealm acknowledged that fans may be disappointed by the news, before adding that the devs need "to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can."</p><p>NetherRealm hasn't officially announced which game is coming next from the studio, but the most likely choice would be Mortal Kombat 2. DC fighting game fans would probably also like to see NeatherRealm get around to Injustice 3, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/" data-ref-id="1900-6416680">Injustice 2</a> was released eight years ago without getting a proper sequel.</p><p>Earlier this year, NetherRealm added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-adds-a-secret-fight-against-pink-floyd-kind-of/1100-6528939/" data-ref-id="1100-6528939">a pink ninja named Floyd</a> as a hidden battle in Mortal Kombat 1, which may be the final piece of bonus content in the game. Warner Bros. has also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-is-a-list-material-in-new-images/1100-6530158/" data-ref-id="1100-6530158">new images from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie</a>, which will hit theaters on October 24.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Most notably, both the Light and Heavy Bowguns are receiving some substantial buffs, as are the Hammer and Hunting Horn. For the bowguns, various ammo types are seeing a damage increase, as well as an increase to the number of hits when using Dragon Ammo. There are other smaller adjustments too, with the only nerf to come out of the Bowgun changes being a decrease to Elemental Ammo damage.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Hammer and Hunting Horn, both blunt weapons are seeing some major improvements. Hammer is having the "overall" power of its attacks increased, as well as improvements to responsiveness when charging an attack. The hitbox has also been increased for Upswing and sneak attacks. Hunting Horn has seen the damage of some of its key attacks (Echo Bubble, Performance, and Focus Strike: Reverb) increased, as well as a "significant" increase to Encore damage. Capcom has also toned down the visual effects of Echo Bubbles in order to help improve visibility during hunts.</p><p dir="ltr">Those caught up in Monster Hunter Wilds' endgame grind will find more to do soon, as the latest patch makes it so higher-difficulty quests should now appear more frequently as a player's Hunter Rank increases. As detailed in the patch notes, that translates to increased spawn rates for quests with multiple monsters and increased Tempered monster spawn rates. As for monster balance changes, the main change is that monsters resistant to paralysis with now gain more resistance to the ailment each time it's triggered on them, which should make it harder to keep monsters locked down.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the more frequent Tempered monster spawns are five additional Tempered monsters for players to hunt. At Hunter Rank 41 and higher, players can encounter eight star versions of Tempered Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad.</p><p dir="ltr">Fashion Hunters will have more to do as well, with new Hunter and Palico armor sets, outfits for Alma, and additional gestures, pendants, and stickers. Other additions in the patch include the addition of Mandarin Chinese as a language option, the ability to use the rest feature while in tents in Suja and the Grand Hub, and a whole lot of bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds has proven to be a huge success for Capcom. It's currently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025 so far</a>, having sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/" data-ref-id="1100-6530490">10 million copies in its first month</a>, and has helped cement Monster Hunter as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/" data-ref-id="2900-6294">Capcom's best-selling game franchises</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds Patch 1.011.00.00 Notes</h2><h3>Major Additions and Changes</h3><ul><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration is now available.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration side missions have been added.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration Arena Quests have been added.</li><li>– Akuma has been added as an NPC.</li><li>– Akuma-only actions have been added, which can also deal damage to monsters.</li><li>– Five more Tempered Monsters (8★) have been added to the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus.1199667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the Days of Play 2025 promotion, running from 28th May through 11th June to coincide with Summer Games Fest, and bringing discounts for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> consoles, accessories, games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a>.</p>
<p>This includes some significant sale pricing on PlayStation 5 consoles. In the US and Canada, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 bundle is starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD for the digital edition, saving up to $120 if bought separately. Meanwhile, standalone consoles in Europe and Asia will also be on sale, starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980 for the digital edition. There will also be a $50 USD discount on the PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>That’s potentially a good set of savings, bringing the price of the digital consoles down significantly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">below what the MSRP was</a> prior to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">the price hikes in April this year</a>. I’m not sure why Sony aren’t saying the price of disk drive consoles, outside of “starting from” giving lower numbers.</p>
<p>There will also be offers for PS5 accessories and games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 USD off PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li>
<li>$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off Access controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Discounts will also be rolling out through the PlayStation Store on hundreds of games, and there’s also some savings to be had on PlayStation Plus. New subscribers can save up to 33% on a 12-month membership, though this will depend on region and tier – PS Plus Essential typically only has a 20% discount in these deals now, though Sony has not yet stated what the discount will be, sticking with the “up to” descriptor.&nbsp;If you upgrade from PS Plus Essential or Extra to PS Plus Premium, then you will also save 33%.</p>

<p>Sony’s revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/">PS Plus Monthly Games for June</a>, with a bonus fourth title, the Destiny 2: The Final Shape year-long expansion.</p>
<p>For PS Plus Extra, games added through the next fortnight include Another Crab’s Treasure (PS5), Skull and Bones (PS5), Destiny 2: Legacy Collection (PS5, PS4) and Grand Theft Auto III (PS4, PS5). Meanwhile, Myst and Riven are added to the PS Plus Premium Classics library.&nbsp;There’s also PS Plus trials for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive announced that its debut smash-hit RPG, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has hit <strong>3.3 million copies sold</strong>, 33 days after the game launched.</p>
<p>"<em>We couldn't make that up</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892">post on X</a> from the game's official account reads. "<em>Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you all.</em>"</p>
<p>It's the latest sign that the stars definitely aligned to help Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reach the audience of players looking for RPG's like Clair Obscur. Even the fact that the week it launched, it did so days after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered arrived, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">ended up helping out Clair Obscur instead of overshadowing it</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond not getting overlooked by an Oblivion remaster, the other major aspect of this milestone is the fact that, like Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched into Xbox Game Pass, so millions of players didn't necessarily need to buy it to check it out. All in all, for a small team like Sandfall Interactive, they couldn't have asked for a better launch for their debut game.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur</a>, he had nothing but praise for it, writing:</p>
<p>"<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive's first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself</em>."</p>

But in Japan, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2025/250527.html">announced a new partnership</a> with Japanese third-party retail sites to combat fraudulent Switch 2 listings.</p><p>Mercari, Yahoo Auctions and Yahoo Flea Market, and Rakuten Rakuma are the participating websites that will, according to a machine translation of Nintendo’s announcement, “proactively remove listings” and establish “a collaborative system for sharing information.” Nintendo says only “fraudulent listings” that violated the sites’ terms of service agreement would be targeted for removal.</p><p>In <a href="https://support.yahoo-net.jp/PccAuctions/s/article/H000014527">a translated statement on Yahoo Japan’s website</a>, the retailer stated that there will be a probationary period for the Switch 2 starting June 5th in which Yahoo Japan will remove listings for the console or suspending the accounts selling them. According to Yahoo Japan, it will revise the probationary period as necessary.</p><p>Scalpers are the bane of any console launch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23137789/aio-buying-bots-ps5-xbox-series-x-console-shortage">Bots flood online buying queues</a> to snap up units before real humans can click “Add to Cart.” Bot users then take advantage of consumer FOMO by listing consoles for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, other sellers use deception to trick people into buying what they think is a console but is actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ebay-issues-warning-to-scammers-selling-photos-of-ps5s">a picture of a box</a> or some other worthless item. (Anti-scalpers would later use <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3lnjzg2iswk2w">a version of this practice</a> for the Switch 2.)</p><p>Hopefully, Nintendo’s plan with third-party sites in Japan works well enough to expand it to other regions.</p><div><p>To cut down on scalpers during the Switch 2 preorder window, Nintendo sent out preorder invitations to users with over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">50 hours of gameplay and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
