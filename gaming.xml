            <p>
It's been almost exactly a year since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">unveiling</a> of Dawnwalker - the new dark fantasy action-RPG from Rebel Wolves. And if you've been eager to learn more - which would be completely understandable, given the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-starts-own-studio-called-rebel-wolves">formed by a number of ex-CD Projekt staff</a>, including Witcher 3 game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - today's your lucky day. Publisher Namco Bandai has now given a first look at Dawnwalker's world in a four-minute cinematic trailer.
</p>
<p>
Rebel Wolves' debut game is now officially titled The Blood of Dawnwalker, and is described as the first chapter in a "brand-new role-playing saga". It's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night".
</p>
<p>
All this unfolds in a 14th century Europe still reeling from the Black Death - a "moment of weakness" for a decimated humanity that gives the world's long-hidden vampires an opporunity to step out and seize control, with other creatures of the night following their lead. "Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same."

<p>
There's not a huge amount of additional detail to be shared right now, but Bandai Namco says players will need to use their skills - combining "vampiric strength with human resolve" - as they embark on a quest to save the ones they love. "Face your foes - be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself," the publisher concludes. "But remember - the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."
</p><p>
Previously, Rebel Wolves CEO Tomaszkiewicz - who also served as a secondary director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> while at CD Projekt - suggested The Blood of Dawnwalker wouldn't "be as gigantic as The Witcher" (instead coming in at around the size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>'s Blood and Wine expansion) but that it could well have a "greater" number of quests. Whether things have changed since then isn't known, but today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWsyV7yQIBQ">cinematic reveal trailer</a> ends with the promise that more information will be shared this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.

<p>It wouldn’t be a VALORANT offseason for Cloud9 without just a little bit of drama. For the second season in a row, the team made more than one late roster move that caught fans off guard. Now though, the team looks to capitalize on the sophomore season of one of last year’s breakout stars in Francis “OXY” Hoang.</p>



<p>At VCT Americas’ Media Day, C9 coach Ian “Immi” Harding spoke to Insider Gaming about OXY’s year two expectations and the new additions to the roster. He also spoke about the necessary culture shift that C9 needs to reach the next level.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A breakout season for OXY last year. What are you hoping to see him do more of in 2025?</strong></p>



<p>This year we’ve been working on a lot of his teamplay, his comms, him actually saying what he wants to do in a round. He has a really good read on the game, but last year he was still getting used to using his own voice. Discipline as well; when we have those two-man advantages, we don’t want him throwing his life away because he wants to get the clip.</p>



<p>We’ve been working around him a lot, and he’s playing an overall better game right now.</p>



<figure><figcaption>v1c (left) and OXY (right) during VCT Spotlight Series Americas 2024. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>IG: Another new addition is v1c, who had a stellar campaign with Shopify. What about his game did you see that you think will impress on the tier one level?</strong></p>



<p>One of the things I feel we lacked last year was firepower and good attitudes. With him he has a great attitude, and great comms which I didn’t expect when trialing. He mid-rounds, he has great ideas, he always wants to help out the coaching staff, he watches VODs back.</p>



<p>But he can shoot. He can really shoot. Now we have shooters on this team. That was the big thing. For smokes players, it was [between] him and Zander, but we didn’t even get a chance to try out Zander. I think all the players that have come in are helping the coaching staff, whereas last year it wasn’t quite like that; we would bring some ideas and they would just get shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IG: Were there specific players that weren’t receptive to ideas and weren’t providing enough firepower?</strong></p>



<p>I don’t want to name names, but the team’s the team now. I just think our culture last year, which I can be to blame too as well for, wasn’t the best. And this year this is something we’ve really worked on; myself, Guglielmo “GUGLi” Carraro, and especially Mitchell “mitch” Semago coming in. The culture of the team is much, much stronger and in a better position.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Immi backstage during the 2024 season. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>[With mitch], it’s still early days, and we’re still learning a lot about each other, but it’s very good. He’s a similar caller to vanity; he can read the game really well. But the things he brings outside the game: he always wants to work on stuff, he wants to work on fundamentals, he wants to make sure we’re not losing ecos. We’re very in sync with that now. He’s bringing out the best of me and I hope I’m bringing out the good in him too.</p>



<p><strong>IG: It took more than a few dramatic steps to get to this roster you have now. Now that it’s together though, what makes it stand out compared to previous rosters?</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s on the same page. We’re having practice days where we’re getting up at 9 am and we’re not finished until 7 pm just because we talk about everything and we’re making sure we’ve got everything right. Obviously a big factor is that we don’t have that much time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tejo-in-valorant-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now [a new] agent is coming in</a>.</p>



<p>They just want to win and they’re all young and they’re hungry. And going into the offseason that’s what I wanted: young, hungry players that wanted to win and a leader who would help me set the culture to the way it should be.</p>

Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 brought them together 25 years ago, but their last crossover was in 2003's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/svc-chaos-snk-vs-capcom-review/1900-6110244/" data-ref-id="1900-6110244">SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</a>. So it's high time for a rematch between Fatal Fury's icon and her counterpart, Chun Li, in Street Fighter 6's first gameplay trailer for Mai.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPlI_oj2VQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kMPlI_oj2VQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Many of Mai's classic moves remain in her arsenal, but she also seems to have greater control of her fire-infused moves, as well. Mai is so powerful here that she trounces both Chun Li and Ryu when she unleashes her full power. Mai also has a new outfit in addition to her famous red costume.</p><p>As glimpsed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fatal-furys-mai-shiranui-shows-off-her-moves-in-street-fighter-6-teaser/1100-6528272/" data-ref-id="1100-6528272">Mai's teaser trailer</a> last month, her Fatal Fury stage looks like it got an update for her appearance in this game. Although Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-bros-ultimate-one-snk-fan-favorite-couldnt-m/1100-6471225/" data-ref-id="1100-6471225">felt that it was inappropriate to add Mai</a> to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, she previously made a guest appearance in Namco's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-or-alive-6-review-combat-ready/1900-6417097/" data-ref-id="1900-6417097">Dead or Alive 6</a>.</p><p>Capcom hasn't revealed when Mai will be added to Street Fighter 6 beyond a vague "Winter 2025" release window. Her fellow Fatal Fury fighter, Terry Bogard, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snks-terry-bogard-and-mai-shiranui-headline-street-fighter-6-year-2-dlc/1100-6524045/" data-ref-id="1100-6524045">was added to Street Fighter 6</a> last year.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> and Metal Gear creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pondering his advancing age again, this time telling fans he "can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", amid confirmation his studio Kojima Productions has now entered "crunch time".
</p>
<p>
Kojima shared his thoughts in a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139">post on social media</a>, his musings seemingly inspired by a recent purchase of Ridley Scott: A Retrospective. "At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock.
</p>
<p>
"Even now, at 87," he continued. "Ridley Scott is still active. And back when he was past 60 — my current stage in life — he created the masterpiece 'Gladiator'."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Kojima has spoken publicly about the ramifications of his advancing years. Last February, the 61-year-old game design legend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">admitted</a> his decision to revisit the action-espionage genre that put him on the map - in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">PlayStation 5 game Physint</a> - came after a period of sickness and surgery, followed by thoughts of his own mortality.

<p>
"I was at my lowest and felt like I couldn't go back to making games," Kojima explained at the time. "I wrote a will, too. And in that moment, I realised that people die. But, I turned 60 last year. I'll turn 70 in 10 years. I hope to never retire. Having said that, if the users desire it so much, I thought I should change my priorities a bit. I still want to do new things, but I decided to make an action-espionage game."
</p><p>
Physint, though, is still some considerable way off, with Kojima Productions first needing to get <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a> out the door. Death Stranding 2 is likely the current priority, however, given it's the only game in the studio's slate to have anything close to a release window right now - with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">sequel expected to arrive this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Kojima's musings on his capacity to remain creative follow his announcement last week that Kojima Productions is officially in crunch mode, presumably as development of Death Stranding 2 enters the final straight. "The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time'", he <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835">wrote on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording," Kojima continued, "there's an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It's incredibly tough."
</p>
<p>
Kojima's schedule is unlikely to clear anytime soon, of course. On top of Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint, he's also working on a Physint movie, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">heavily involved in a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding</a> - which is being made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">in partnership with A24</a>.

Players will be able to bring the heat with Mai across all three game modes, including Fighting Ground and Battle Hub, as well as checking her out as the newest <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter in World Tour.</p><p>The dazzling Mai also drops with two Outfits. Outfit 1 is reminiscent of her classic style across SNK’s historic <em>Fatal Fury</em> series while Outfit 2 will be themed around her newest look in the upcoming Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Outfit 2 can be acquired via Fighter Coins or maxing out your bond with her in World Tour.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_938132"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the trailer, Mai’s moveset uses a variety of familiar and newer techniques during matches to control her opponents with flaming projectiles, divekicks and more, including:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Kachousen</strong> – Mai throws her fan like a fireball. When used normally, the fan loses to other projectiles and your opponent’s strikes can knock them down. But when you hold down the input, they can no longer be neutralized by strikes. In addition, if the fan hits an opponent, it will pop up and fall down on them for another hit.</li><li><strong>Ryuuenbu</strong> – Spin forward in a fiery blaze for combos or to control space.</li><li><strong>Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Perform a cartwheel and fly towards opponents to elbow them. The <a title="Games > OD [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/od">OD</a> version sends Mai into the air to follow up on the attack or to surprise opponents below.</li><li><strong>Hishou Ryuuenjin</strong> – Mai’s dragon punch, which works as an effective anti-air as she delivers a flying upwards kick bathed in flame.</li><li><strong>Kagerou no Mai </strong>– Mai’s Level 1 Super Art, she sets the immediate vicinity on fire, which can be useful as an anti-air move or combo ender. The move also gives Mai five Flame Stocks which give all of Mai’s special moves and Level 1 and 2 Super Arts special properties.</li><li><strong>Chou Hissatsu Shinobi Bachi</strong> – Mai’s Level 2 Super Art where she rushes forward in a blaze of glory that can get around projectiles.</li><li><strong>Shiranui Ryuu</strong> – Enbu Ada Zakura: Mai’s Level 3 Super Art, she flies like a butterfly and stings like a bee in a series of elegant fan strikes.</li></ul><p>Mai will be ready to spice things up next month for players who own or purchase the Year 2 Character Pass or Year 2 Ultimate Pass, and can also be purchased with Fighter Coins.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-caroline-kwan-california-firefighters-twitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As wildfires rage across southern California, displacing thousands and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-fires-winds-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing 24</a> as of this publishing, the state draws on the labor of <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5081791-incarcerated-firefighters-join-california-wildfire-battle-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 1,000 incarcerated firefighters</a> to help quell the blaze. Over the weekend, Twitch streamers Hasan Piker and Caroline Kwan <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2350601305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed a crew of those firefighters</a> in person, who revealed, among other things, that they are <a href="https://x.com/HasanabiProd/status/1878270180616200647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hideously underpaid</a> and that simple pleasures like video games help make their lives more bearable. This led to <a href="https://x.com/DmachineXClut/status/1878289541825695920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a call for video game donations</a> from well-meaning Piker fans and collaborators. In the days following, they have “inundated” that specific fire camp, <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/washington-ridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Ridge #44</a>, with video games. But there are still other ways you can help out.</p><p>Speaking with Aftermath, a representative of Washington Ridge #44 noted that the streamers’ conversation with incarcerated firefighters had a big impact. The camp is now swimming in games for its PlayStation 4.</p><p>"We've been inundated with calls on that, and we've got all we need here,” the representative told Aftermath. “Donations are always welcome, but be careful as to what type of things are donated to a camp. I mean, ping-pong paddles and pool sticks and stuff like that are fine, but then you get into video games and stuff, and then you get inundated. We don't have the capability or the need for all that stuff."&nbsp;</p><p>But Washington Ridge #44 is just one camp, and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/camps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are 36 in total</a> under the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s umbrella – all of which have contributed at least one strike team to the wildfire-fighting effort, according to the Washington Ridge #44 rep. Aftermath called several to get details on their specific needs.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alder #20</a> has an Xbox (version unspecified), and a rep added that “We only have so many TVs,” so the camp is “pretty set” on games for now. But, he continued, it’s “one break away from not having one.” He noted, for example, that $7,000 in gym equipment succumbed to the ravages of wear and tear after just a month, so there’s no guarantee that game consoles will remain functional indefinitely. All this in mind, if you’ve got a spare Xbox, feel free to <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/alder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">send it</a>.</p><p>Those incarcerated at <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/deadwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadwood #23</a>, like their counterparts at Washington Ridge #44, have access to a PS4, and they’re “always looking for games,” according to a representative of the facility. The only restriction is that games have to be playable offline. Otherwise, games of any age rating are fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/growlersburg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growlersburg #33</a> is also “good” on games, while <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/norco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norco #0</a> and <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/conservation-camps/cuesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuesta #24</a> use a different system than all the other camps, going through the CDCR instead of fielding donations directly. The big takeaway? If you’d like to send your spare games – or anything else – to incarcerated firefighters, call ahead. Each facility has different needs, and you want to be sure your donations are reaching their intended recipients.</p><p>There’s also the option to donate money to incarcerated firefighters either via <a href="https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1878270113637351864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizations like the Anti-Recidivism Coalition</a> or to specific individuals by way of JPAY <a href="https://x.com/kelswizzIe/status/1878517378855915860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you can find their information online</a>. These people are saving lives for pocket change, and yet they face a future in which they might be <a href="https://www.knkx.org/2024-07-05/incarcerated-people-who-helped-fight-wildfires-struggle-to-build-a-career-post-prison" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied a proper, adequately-compensated job</a> doing the exact same thing after they’ve served their time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-magic-presents-spring-flourishes-event-showcases-new-dd-themed-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new draft event for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The event, Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes, will be available in supporting retail stores in April. Participants can obtain new cards featuring characters and artwork from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/earn-d-and-d-themed-promo-cards-with-magic-presents-spring-flourishes" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explained what players can expect from Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes. The event will take place between April 25 to May 25, in keeping with the Spring title.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-presents-spring-flourishes-evin-and-jurin.jpg?itok=opwySXC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-presents-spring-flourishes-evin-and-jurin.jpg?itok=LB4dNVIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the draft event itself, that will depend on the store you visit The draft could use any set; it all depends on what that store has in mind. Either way, you will still draft in pods of eight, then play against your fellow participants.</p>

<p>But the big draw of this event are the promotional <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> cards. Everyone who participates in the event will get a non-foil borderless card of a legendary creature from the world of D&amp;D.</p>

<p>These cards will be quite familiar for those who recall the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> Secret Lair. This is because this draft event is part of the first official Secret Lair test by Wizards of the Coast. Among those creatures is the legendarily large red dragon Themberchaud.</p>

Sometimes, these limited drops feature familiar cards with different names or artwork. But on occasion, a completely unique card is made to better represent the theme of that Secret Lair.</p>

<p>In order to prevent availability issues and mitigate FOMO, Wizards announced their "SLX" program. Under this program, any mechanically unique cards released as part of a Secret Lair will have a counterpart made available. Mechanically the same, but aesthetically different. Furthermore, you can purchase these non-foil cards from your local retail store.</p>

<p>The Magic Presents: Spring Flourish event is the first attempt at this Secret Lair test. So your participation and feedback will ensure whether these kinds of events will continue.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves, which is represented by former CD Projekt Red talent, has revealed The Blood of Dawnwalker with a lengthy cinematic trailer and a short gameplay teaser. The trailer was released today, introducing this ‘brand-new role-playing saga’ that begins with this open-world single-player RPG.</p>



<p>The studio is led by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the creative mind who directed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which was released back in 2015. In some of the visual and audio elements of the trailer for The Blood of Dawnwalker, some Witcher-themed inspiration can be detected.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-treading-the-line">Treading the Line</h2>



<p>In the blurb that accompanied the new trailer, Rebel Wolves wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. </p>



<p>But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun’s light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer showcases brutal combat, with enemies being torn to pieces and even exploded by a gaggle of bloodthirsty and powerful vampires. There’s plenty of emotional, fountains of blood, and a glimpse at a wide, open world with impressive potential.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The team neglected to provide any kind of a release window for the game, but a full gameplay reveal is schedule to take place this summer – potentially at Summer Games Fest.</p>

                <p>Emails are about to be way more interesting. A developer has created a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-6159022/" data-ref-id="1900-6159022">Doom</a> port that can be played within a PDF file on a web browser. Aptly named "doom.pdf," the file allows you to boot up the original game and control the character using your keyboard, following the usual WASD movement scheme, the space bar to shoot, and the numbers one to seven to circle between weapons.</p><p>The developer, who goes by ading.dev, shared some details about the process behind the hilarious project via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ading.dev/post/3lfluu6rw6k2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>. It's a bit on the technical side of things, but the port was possible thanks to PDFs supporting JavaScript. Using Emscripten, a compiler that compiles C and C++ source code to WebAssembly, they compiled Doom to asm.js, a subset of JavaScript. In short, it's how ading.dev got Doom running in a PDF.</p><p>Both input and output are done by manipulating text input fields. If you aren't tech-savvy, don't worry, as you don't need to manually input commands. In order to play the game, all you need is to <a href="https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open doom.pdf</a> and follow the instructions. You can either click on the control layout on screen, or type inside a box to mimick the keyboard controls. If the game doesn't work, make sure that you're opening the PDF in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome.)</p><p>While doom.pdf is far from the best way to play Id Software's classic shooter, it's a marvel to see the port in action. It's yet the latest example of developers and programming enthusiasts capitalizing on dozens of absurd iterations over the years, including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-doom-running-on-100-pounds-of-moldy-potatoes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">potato-sourced electricity powering a calculator</a>. If you're wondering what the current state of Doom is as a franchise, Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive in 2025. In June 2024, developers at Id Software said that Doom 1 and Doom 2 were inspirations for the protagonist's origins in the upcoming entry. If you're curious to learn more about it, Doom: The Dark Ages has a spot in the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">Xbox Developer Direct</a> later this month.</p>

In the wake of the disasters claiming thousands of lives, the decimated human population struggles for survival. It’s a moment of weakness. In Vale Sangora, somewhere in a forgotten corner of the Carpathian Mountains, vampires seize their opportunity to walk out of the shadows, overthrow the feudal lords and claim what they’ve been denied for centuries: freedom, and ultimate power that comes with it. Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Not fully human, not entirely a vampire, you have 30 days and nights to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.</p><p>The freedom in gameplay is reflected in Coen’s very nature as a Dawnwalker. Depending on the time of day, players will have different skills, abilities and storyline outcomes. Players must choose: do they fight for humanity or embrace the cursed powers?</p></blockquote><p>Watch the trailer below.

The first tease for the studio's inaugural game, The Blood of Dawnwalker, arrived last month. But now, Rebel Wolves has debuted the opening moments of the game, which establish how a valley in medieval Europe fell under control of vampires.</p><p>The trailer introduces the game's main character, Coen, as he attempts to save his plague-stricken sister, Lunka, from the human authorities who intend to execute her. Their lives are spared by the arrival of Brencis and his vampires, who quickly dispatch the guards. Brencis then heals Lunka and tells Coen that they are seizing control of the valley.</p><p>That scene takes place before the beginning of the game. When the main story begins, Coen and his fellow villagers have been living under the vampire regime for two years. Coen is also the titular Dawnwalker, because his silver poisoning prevented him from turning into a full vampire. Instead, Coen remains human during the day, and he transforms into a powerful vampire at night.</p><p>Although the developers stressed the narrative freedom that The Blood of Dawnwalker will give players, there is a ticking clock. Coen only has 30 days and 30 nights to save his family from Brencis' dungeons, and time is a commodity that he has to choose how to spend. Players can also decide to make allies with those who share his desire to bring down the vampires, but not everyone's agenda will line up with Coen's.</p><p>The developers also noted that the vampires do have human supporters, because Brencis has kept them safe and healed them from the plague. But the vampires also treat the humans like cattle, and they aren't free to leave the valley. They've just traded their human feudal lords for vampires who took their place.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker doesn't currently have a release date, but the gameplay reveal will arrive this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fresh details of Bethesda's long-rumoured - but as yet unannounced - Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake have surfaced in a new leak, alongside word it could well be arriving this June.
</p>
<p>
An Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake - supposedly being developed in Unreal Engine 5 - was first rumoured in July 2023, when a former Virtuos employee posted to Reddit claiming it was in the works at the Chinese studio. Curiously, references to an Oblivion <em>remaster</em> then emerged later that year, spotted in an internal Microsoft document from 2020 that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">leaked during the company's court battle with the FTC</a>, lending at least some credence to the earlier claim.
</p>
<p>
But that wasn't the end of it. Earlier this month, a Virtuos technical art director updated their LinkedIn profile to highlight their work on a mysterious "unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake", and now another former employee has - seemingly unintentionally - shared more explicit details of a Virtuos-developed Oblivion remake on their own website.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">reported by MP1st</a>, the unnamed employee - who is said to have worked on the project between 2023 and 2024 - described the game as a "fully remade" version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, developed (as previously rumoured) in Unreal 5. The former Virtuos employee is also said to have referenced six gameplay systems reworked for the remake: stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction, and HUD.
</p><p>
The new blocking system, as summarised by MP1st, supposedly takes inspiration from games including Souls-likes, to replace an original system considered too "boring" and "frustrating", while archery has been improved to make it "more playable and modern" in first- and third-person views. The new stamina system, meanwhile, is described as being "less frustrating", with the knockdown that occurs when stamina is depleted now less frequent.
</p>
<p>
As for the Oblivion remake's updated sneaking, it'll apparently feature highlighted Sneak icons and reworked damage calculations, and that's alongside the introduction of hit reactions to improve the response to damage inflicted on the player and NPCs. Additionally, MP1st says the former employee referenced an updated HUD intended to be "easier to understand and more aesthetically appealing to young players."
</p>
<p>
MP1st's report follows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">recent claims by reliable leaker NateTheHate</a> that an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake would be launching this June. Before all that, of course, developer Bethesda will actually need to announce the thing - and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct currently scheduled for next week</a>, an opportunity is looming.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/2002s-neverwinter-nights-gets-a-patch-in-2025-from-unpaid-software-engineers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><em>Neverwinter Nights</em> came out in 2002 and received an enhanced edition in 2018. In 2025, that should really be it, but there's something special about Bioware's second dip into the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> universe. The energy from the game's community is strong enough that, based largely on the work of "unpaid software engineers," the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704450/view/511820969218671050">received a new patch last week</a>.</p>
<p><em>Neverwinter Nights (NN) Enhanced Edition</em> (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack">GOG</a>)&nbsp;now has anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering built in, major improvements to its networking code and performance, and <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/">more than 100 other improvements</a>. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">noted by PC Gamer</a>,&nbsp;<em>NN</em> was originally built for single-core CPUs, so while it may seem odd to seek "major" improvements to performance for a 23-year-old RPG, it is far from optimized for modern systems.</p>
<p><em>NN&nbsp;</em>received a similar fan-led patch, described as "a year-long love effort" by community developers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/one-of-my-favorite-dandd-videogames-is-still-getting-beefy-updates-after-21-years/">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's not so surprising that&nbsp;<em>NN </em>achieved this kind of fan-driven immortality. Opinions vary on the virtues of its single-player campaigns, but its "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/23-year-old-d-and-d-rpg-neverwinter-nights-just-got-a-new-update-thanks-to-the-unpaid-software-engineers-of-its-unkillable-community/">persistent worlds</a>," essentially tiny MMOs run by people with DM-like powers, kept it from giving off the abandoned feel of other "massive" online games. Fantasy author Luke Scull credits the game with launching his writing career and continues to work on an unofficial sequel to the game, <a href="https://www.lukescull.com/2021/07/14/announcing-the-blades-of-netheril-an-unofficial-sequel-to-the-neverwinter-nights-original-campaign/"><em>The Blades of Netheril</em></a>, with a roadmap of seven chapters through at least 2027.</p>

                <p>Hyper Light Breaker drops into early access on PC on January 14 (tomorrow!) and now it's got a trailer to match. The game is a 3D, open-world, co-op, rogue-lite sequel to Hyper Light Drifter.</p><p>Up to three players can explore the randomly generated worlds of Hyper Light Breaker. In that world they'll find bosses called Crowns, and, of course, plenty of weapons and loot to augment each player's build. This new entry is a departure from the series' past. Hyper Light Drifter was a single-player, pixelated, isometric action game. However, both share a neon-drenched color scheme, an emphasis on fast-paced action, and a story communicated mostly through gesture and aesthetic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClJaGZI-P78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ClJaGZI-P78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer shows most of this off. It follows a party of three "Breakers," who all have their own unique builds, as they explore the world. One wields a blue laser swords with a rifle. Another has a giant hammer. Special abilities also play a role, as one character drops a giant cube onto an enemy. The trio share movement abilities, including wall runs, hang-gliders, and hoverboards. The trailer also features footage from multiple boss battles, including one with a giant sword-wielding wolf and another against a glowing, armored warrior in a coliseum. Hyper Light Breaker was originally set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-delayed-to-fall-first-gameplay-trailer-revealed/1100-6512324/" data-ref-id="1100-6512324">early access in Spring 2023</a>. It got delayed to Fall 2023 and then further delayed into early 2025. You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> now.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breakers-roguelike-loop-didnt-engage-me-but-i-want-to-give-it-another-chance/1100-6524624/" data-ref-id="1100-6524624">Hyper Light Breaker preview,</a> Jordan Ramée wrote, "I feel like my big takeaway from my time with Hyper Light Breaker is that I need to give it another chance. This first impression wasn't very good... But games launch in early access for this very reason, and it's possible that most of my concerns won't be in the game when I play it again." In between Hyper Light games, developer Heart Machine released action platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/agdq-2025-earns-2-5-million-for-charity-with-its-best-event-yet.1081338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342952/best-runs-of-agdq-2025-speedrunning-charity-twitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, raising just over $2.5 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Every Games Done Quick event is worth tuning in to either live or later via VODs, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game">this AGDQ was uniquely fantastic</a>, filled with runs that’ll go down as some of the best GDQ has to offer. Here are some of our favorites: </p><p><h3><em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em></h3></p><p>The great thing about the speedrunning community is that it’s often not enough to be the fastest runner of a particular game. That’s boring. For Wes, simply running <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii </em>wasn’t enough to satisfy him. He had to get creative with it, deciding to master playing the game as fast as possible <em>while playing the piano.</em> But how can someone play a video game if both their hands are occupied, you ask? The answer is obvious: by controlling the game with your head and feet. I don’t know what inspires a human to do this kind of thing, and I don’t care. All that matters is that Wes put the depth of human ability (and multitasking) on display, and it was brain-breaking to watch.</p><p><h3><em>Elden Ring</em> bonus showcase</h3></p><p>Speaking of incredible human talent, how about playing <em>Elden Ring</em> — a game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">known for its punishing difficulty</a> — with a saxophone. I was looking forward to this run all week, and Dr. Doot did not disappoint, but not for the reason I expected. It’s one thing to beat the likes of Malenia, Blade of Miquella with a specially programmed aerophone. But nothing could have prepared me for every input, from landing an attack to using consumables, sounding a hilarious “doot” noise. I cried laughing it was so funny. </p><p><h3><em>Super Metroid</em></h3></p><p><em>Super Metroid</em> is a GDQ staple, often anchoring the event’s last day in a week’s worth of programming. But lately, GDQ has gotten away from featuring a mere run of the game to instead showcase all the work the <em>Super Metroid</em> modding community has put into keeping this game from 1994 fresh and interesting. This four-way race of <em>Super Metroid</em> included a map randomizer, meaning the game’s normal layout had been shuffled around and put together in an all-new configuration.</p><p>Map randomizers for a <em>Metroid </em>game are uniquely dangerous because all of the abilities you need to progress are no longer laid out in a logical fashion. Samus might run into the fiery pits of Lower Norfair long before finding the heat-shielding Varia suit. And with the map randomized, it’s now way harder (and takes way longer) to find where the suit is. Now add an element of competition, and you’ve got one of the finest races in AGDQ history.</p><p><h3><em>Crazy Taxi</em> with live backing band</h3></p><p>It used to be that if you wanted to avoid DMCA strikes for playing a game on Twitch with licensed music, you just turned the music off. But AGDQ has come up with a novel way to get around this old problem. For this run of<em> Crazy Taxi</em>, every song was played by a cover band that transformed AGDQ from a speedrunning video game event into an impromptu punk rock show — mini-mosh pit and all — and it ruled. I’m not gonna share any details. Just go watch it for yourself.</p><p>GDQ is a uniquely special event for more reasons than featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194234/summer-games-done-quick-2024-recap-peanut-butter-the-dog">cool, creative, or crazy-ass runs</a>. In a world where cowardly corporations have decided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338471/meta-hate-speech-hateful-conduct-policy-moderation">it’s okay to call women and LGBTQ+ people slurs</a>, and one where gamers have a unique reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">for being awful to each other</a> for differences beyond our control, Games Done Quick has been very vocal in its support of marginalized people. Whether it be its diverse programming with <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/framefatales">Frame Fatales</a> or <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash">Black in a Flash</a> or the mere fact that every other donation featured a message of “Trans Rights,” which was enthusiastically read aloud and enthusiastically cheered by the live crowd.</p><p>Games Done Quick has been a shining example of how intentionally curated communities can foster acceptance and be a source of joy and goodness in a climate that needs it, and AGDQ 2025 was one of the best.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Historically speaking, video game movies often fail to do well at the box office, and even bigger hits like the <em>Resident Evil</em> films routinely do better outside the United States and Canada.

The first to pull off that feat was <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> in 2023. </p><p>Even reaching $100 million domestically has traditionally been a struggle for video game films.

In North America it made an astounding $575 million. So yeah, Mario is beating Sonic. Don’t worry, the blue blur and Sega are used to it. It’s not the first time and it likely won’t be the last.</p><p>But hey, at least the <em>Sonic </em>movies are interesting films with their own identities and featuring some wonderful performances by folks like Jim Carrey and Ben Schwartz. I’ll watch the <em>Sonic </em>movies again. I’d rather eat sand than watch the <em>Super Mario Bros </em>movie again.

A number of enemies like Silverfist Commander, Plaguebearers, and Lost Men Zealots are getting reworked to feel more fair as well.</p><p>“Now, we have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make, and one of the best things about having the game in Early Access with the endgame is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character power to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relative to that,” game director  Jonathan Rogers told fans over the weekend. “But those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league with a new economy for people to play in.”</p><p>A league in <em>Path of Exiles</em> is like a season in <em>Diablo</em>, and with the game having just arrived in early access on Steam and console in December, it’s possible the game’s bigger overhaul won’t arrive until closer to the end of winter. Rogers said the team at Grinding Gear Games wanted to get these more immediate tweaks out into players’ hands before prepping the more major stuff for release.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> will go free-to-play like its predecessor once it releases in full, but for now it’s $30 to try. That barrier to entry has barely phased players on Steam, though. The multiplayer RPG about beating back the darkness is still one of the Valve-owned storefront’s top-five best-selling and most-played games a month after launching. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While some might believe you can just out-damage an enemy team to victory, if they have someone healing their team and providing utility beyond making numbers go up or down, they’re more than likely going to outplay you. That’s certainly the case in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>, and thankfully its roster of supportive Strategist characters is pretty varied and has a myriad of playstyles to choose from. But who are the best and worst ones in NetEase’s hero shooter right now? Let’s find out as we rank them from the weakest link to the best in the business of healing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-recommend-id="image://e7cd2cee155a657cb9c7d3db1e2a6b02" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loki looks at the camera while holding his staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far be it from me to tell the trickster god he’s got too many tricks in his kit, but Loki has a lot going on in his moveset and it makes him harder to nail down than most Strategists in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. In the right hands, Loki is a diabolical menace of survivability and trickery, but his effectiveness feels very much determined by the specific situations in which he finds himself. His ultimate, which allows him to transform into another character on the field and use their ultimate ability, is a fun gimmick and may give you the opportunity to pull off a clutch play, but it’s so dependent on who’s around that it can make him less reliable than other heroes on the roster. Loki can keep your team alive against otherwise devastating attacks and play tricks on your foes as he creeps around undetected and pops to different locations, but I have a hard time imagining most players telling someone to switch to Loki because the current team comp isn’t working.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-recommend-id="image://94621bfcf8680f0d13ebb107b8ce6129" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket leans on his gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s feisty furball is one of the most fun Strategists to play in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, even if his actual utility is a bit unremarkable. He’s super mobile when climbing up walls and flying around on his jetpack. His team-up with Groot is a blast to use as he rides on the sentient tree’s back and pumps out heals, essentially making the two unstoppable. And who could forget the most useful gadget in his arsenal: the team-reviving B.R.B. machine that basically gives a teammate a second life? But while Rocket is a lot of fun to play, he’s not the most efficient healer and his power-boosting ultimate is easily destroyed. I love Rocket, he’s my main Strategist. But there are better healers on the roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-recommend-id="image://dde623dd70ffabac7cc6565de89860c6" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jeff makes a silly little face because he's a silly little guy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ most mischievous little guy’s not the most efficient healer, but there’s a reason he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">a pest an enemy team hates to see coming</a></span>. He’s incredibly mobile, can ride on Groot’s back, and his healing bubbles allow him to disperse support without having to be up the team’s ass at all times. Best of all, his ultimate is the kind of thing that can flip a fight with minimal effort. Swallowing up entire teams to spit them off the map or just pulling them away from an objective is a quick and efficient way to completely shift a game. Players are starting to learn ways to counter him, but sending an entire team tumbling down into a chasm is still one of the most reliable strategies in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-recommend-id="image://89fb01d6bbf46ebe8263781e322a61d3" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adam Warlock holds his hand out toward the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Marvel’s “perfect specimen” has a pretty unique kit that offers an interesting approach to the support archetype. He’s got decent heals, excellent damage, and an ultimate that can revive an entire wiped team. Perhaps most interesting of all, his novel approach to survivability has him evenly distributing incoming damage across multiple characters. Like Loki, he’s a bit more complex than some Strategists and can easily prove useless to an inexperienced player, but a skilled one can get an insane amount of value out of his kit.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-recommend-id="image://be5c87f9e40e8c3639cce59161bbaf0e" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Invisible Woman stands with her arms by her side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sue Storm is <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ newest Strategist and the latest to fall into an odd archetype of “women who throw light blobs at enemies.” At least her invisibility and shields make her distinguishable from others in the same box. Invisible Woman’s support comes in the form of not just heals but protection, with her shields radiating healing energy as they defend teammates from incoming fire. She can also use them to push and pull enemies around, making her great for plays that make use of the environment like pushing foes off a map. Her cloaking abilities are versatile, allowing her to both escape difficult situations and set up for an ambush. And her ultimate marries all of the above to create a powerful healing barrier that hides characters inside from incoming damage or heals. Sure, you can blindly fire within her ultimate, but you’re wasting time and bullets if you can’t actually see what’s inside. It also has some incredible combo potential, such as a Scarlet Witch preparing her explosive ultimate inside it, keeping enemies on the outside from seeing her and running for cover. Players are still getting the hang of her, as she’s only been in the game since Season 1 began on January 10, but even in those few short days she’s shown a lot of potential.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-recommend-id="image://aa39bdf4b2ece26d0465228d210ef4f9" data-format="png" data-width="1403" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloak and Dagger reach out toward the screen in a cool action pose." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cloak &amp; Dagger has one of the most unique set-ups of any character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The duo is able to freely swap between the supportive Dagger and Cloak the saboteur. The two’s duality is captured in every facet of their design, both visually and mechanically. Dagger’s dazzling as she rains down healing on a team while Cloak is enveloped in darkness and is able to blind enemies. They’re diametrically opposed characters in nearly every way, tied together by an unbreakable bond. You essentially have to master two playstyles and learn to manage each of their cooldowns to be an effective player, and skillfully swapping between the two at a moment’s notice can make the difference between a game-saving play or a quick defeat. By design they’re one of the most versatile picks in the game, and I hope they’re a sign that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will continue to find innovative ways to fill out its roster.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-recommend-id="image://13a0d4c4bb84a686487292a69691fdd2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mantis stands with her hand on her hip." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy account for almost half of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Strategists, but Mantis is far and away the standout among the three, and one of the most reliable picks in the game. Her utility is some of the best, allowing her to boost damage with her empathic abilities and hard crowd control foes by putting them to sleep, all with solid damage and healing output. On top of that, her ultimate is one of the best survival abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. She heals surrounding foes and converts that healing to overhealth almost immediately, giving her team a tool to push through fortified enemy teams with and helping them hold their ground against the deadliest onslaught of foes. Honestly, depending on the day, I could see Mantis being tied for the number-one spot with who our first-place winner. There just aren’t really any situations in which having a good Mantis on your team is a bad play.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-recommend-id="image://89c55ae02e7ad5ac1c56ed38a8c97d83" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow points at the camera with one of her knees raised as if she is dancing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ resident k-pop star is our pick for the hero shooter’s best strategist. Like Mantis, her kit has great healing and strong CC, and her ultimate is probably the most efficient healing ultimate in the game. It also has a slight edge on Mantis’ similar ult because of its versatility, with Luna being able to shift between near-insurmountable healing and devastating damage boosts that can help your team overcome just about anything. Some of my earliest memories of good team synergy in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>involved using Star-Lord’s ult over a dancing Luna Snow as she cranked up my damage output, deleting enemy teams in seconds. Luna Snow and Mantis have a lot of the same utility with different flavors, but the dancing queen just slightly comes out on top thanks to her excellent Team-up abilities, which give new tools to Namor and Jeff the Land Shark and allow her to wield Iron Fist’s Chi to keep enemies from getting too close. They’re both queens in their own right, though.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 can seem awfully daunting towards beginners and new players, but the iconic tactical shooter from Valve is easy to learn. Unlike in other popular multiplayer titles where there is a constantly shifting meta, CS2 mostly stays the same, apart from the occasional map pool change, a new gun, or a small gameplay tweak.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player jumping into CS2 for the first time ever, here are some tips for beginners to use.<em> </em></p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-learn-the-maps-and-callouts">Learn the Maps and Callouts</h2>



<p>CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier, uses an active duty map pool that consists of seven bomb defusal maps. Getting used to the map layouts is important to CS2 beginners, but so too is learning the callouts, i.e. the names of specific locations. Knowing the callouts is key to relaying information between teammates.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a second monitor, display the map with callouts on your second screen. Over time, you’ll learn the callout locations and will be able to call them without needing the map. There are also community-made aim courses in the Steam Workshop that will help you learn common angles an hiding spots on each map. Speaking of aim courses…</p>



<h2 id="h-practice-makes-perfect">Practice Makes Perfect</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Practicing is the only way to get better when you’re a new player to CS2</a>. Arms Race is a great mode for getting used to how all the weapons work and then you can use aim courses, warmup servers, and deathmatches to prioritize the crucial weapons. Once you feel capable with the main weapons, you can jump into Casual games first to get a better sense of the game.</p>



<p>Whether it’s weapon recoil or the round-to-round economy, the only way to get properly familiarized with all the systems in CS2 is to practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-communicate-clearly">Communicate Clearly</h2>



<p>Regardless if you’re a beginner or a veteran player with 1000+ hours, communication is key to winning in CS2. Communication in CS2 is crucial to coordinating everything: T-side rounds, retakes, buys, and crossfires. If you end up getting killed but you relay no information to your teammates, that round loss is on you.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re interested in playing competitive CS2, then it should be a requirement that you have a mic that you use. In a game like CS2, if you’re playing competitive, text chat and pings just are not good enough. And remember that a key part of communication is positivity. If you’re only using your mic to flame your teammates, you’re part of the problem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-hacker-compromises-66-player-accounts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2’s lead developers have revealed that a hacker was able to compromise 66 player accounts recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-broke-into-path-of-exile-2-admin-account-hijacked-wave-of-characters-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404Media</a>, Path of Exile 2’s lead developers, Jonathan and Mark, recently appeared on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> with Ghazzy TV and Darth Microtransaction. During this interview, the duo was asked whether there had been a data breach at the studio. Mark responded that there had been a situation where a Steam account got hacked, which gave the hacker access to an admin account on Path of Exile 2’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers revealed that they are now aware of how the hacker took over the admin account, but they do not understand the “full scope” of what occurred then. Mark explained that one of their admin accounts was linked to a Steam account, and the user of this account wasn’t aware of that. The Path of Exile 2 hacker compromised this account through Steam support, and as the user was not using the account, the malicious activity wasn’t noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason the Path of Exile 2 hacker went unnoticed was a bug in the system. Mark elaborated that whenever an admin account makes changes, the events are logged into an audit log, which can be checked later. However, due to a bug in the system, the password changes were not recorded as events but as notes instead. The hacker was able to delete these notes, which is why the team at GGG could not tell what was wrong when they looked through the accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark confirmed that 66 notes were deleted, which means that the Path of Exile 2 hacker was able to compromise 66 accounts. However, their log history only extends for 30 days, and the hack began 5 days before that, so the full extent is unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark stated they would release a report with all the information they could gather in a day or two. They feared GGG’s data would be breached, and the hacker might gain access to the servers, but that wasn’t the case. The development team also added a bunch of more “security stuff,” which Mark admits should have already been in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark also confirmed that the moment the team realised what was going on, they immediately reset the passwords for all admin accounts and deleted all sessions to ensure their safety. Since then, the Path of Exile 2 hacker has not compromised any other accounts.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://steamforged.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamforged Games library</a>, you will find adaptations of some of the video game world’s biggest franchises sprinkled throughout – from Monster Hunter to Devil May Cry, Sea of Thieves to Gears of War, and their gigantic Elden Ring adaptation that is releasing soon. But for now, let's look at the company's Resident Evil series of titles with Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Resident Evil 2 back in 2019, followed by Resident Evil 3 in 2021, and finally Resident Evil in 2023, each game of the trio plays out similarly, sharing a majority of the same mechanics between one another. In each title, you and up to three friends take turns navigating dark passages, burning streets, and nefarious labs as you play out the stories of each respective game. Each game comes complete with a plethora of incredibly detailed plastic miniatures depicting the gruesome creatures you will be going up against alongside those representing your survivor heroes. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player’s turn consists of three phases – the Action Phase, the Reaction Phase, and lastly the Tension phase. What you can do on your turns is straightforward – you have four actions, and with those actions, you can either move, open or close a door, search an area to grab an item, trade with another player in their square, use an item in their inventory, or attack. Enemies act during the reaction phase, where they move towards or attack the active player, causing the player to roll a die to see if they can avoid the danger. And finally, the Tension Phase has the active player draw from the special Tension deck of cards, which can result in three possible outcomes: Nothing happens, something bad happens, and something really bad happens. By the end of the first full go-around, players should have a pretty solid grasp on how to play the games and can start worrying more about how you will survive and thrive this zombie apocalypse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is done by rolling dice, and comparing the rolls with your equipped weapons stat and abilities. Depending on the result, you may simply push an enemy into an adjacent square, kill them, or miss altogether, and its surprising how tough even the most basic of zombies can be to take down, if your dice rolls aren’t lucky that day. Shooting will also give enemies in the adjoining rooms (as long as the doors are open) a free movement to the source of the sound. It's a system that makes you weigh your options and risks when opting for combat, adding to the overall “survival horror” vibe.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/13/20241021-192149-1736792356417.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a>, each one contains a number of scenarios that can be played either as one-off experiences or strung together, telling the story of the original games where things carry over from one session to the next. Levels are built using tiles with tokens denoting locked doors, items to pick up, and other goodies to uncover.  At the end of each scenario, players take stock of their inventories, health, and other information that may or may not impact future games. If you and your friends opt to play them as one-off games, each scenario also provides you with a list of gear and info to start you off. It works really well either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players that snag multiple entires of the series, there is some crossover that you can do, too – though some things may take a little fidgeting with to work well.  Due to how many mechanics carry over, I have mix-and-matched characters from the other games into ones they don’t normally appear in, such as having Leon trudge through the Spencer Mansion with Chris. Scenario tiles can also be used between games, so long as you don’t mind miss-matched themes on the tiles. Nothing in the rules state this, but if you are so inclined you can without much issue.</p><p id="resident-evil-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Resident Evil: The Board Game">Resident Evil: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="213969"><div id="213969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $114.99 USD</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4 (best with 2)</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes (per scenario)</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbXr7?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest and most refined of the trilogy, Resident Evil, takes and improves the best ideas of the previous two games and throws in some interesting new mechanics of its own, culminating in a really fun and tense package. In this entry, players such as Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Rebecca Chambers, or Barry Burton explore the mysterious Spencer mansion and surrounding grounds. New this time around, however, you will also have access to special support characters Albert Wesker (definitely the most trustworthy person in the series), Enrico Marini, Richard Aiken, and Brad Vickers, who can be sent off on special missions to gather supplies and provide the team with other benefits at the risk of being taken out themselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brought over from Resident Evil 3, the narrative flow of Resident Evil is flexible ,with players able to tackle the mansion’s rooms in a variety of orders, with rooms being unlocked by different items and solving puzzles. The mansion and subsequent locations are made up this time from special cards, an improvement over the dashboard paper of RE3, with smaller areas being built and expanded as you play, similar to something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at the House on the Hill</a>, making setup for scenarios far quicker than the previous games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you aren’t looking to play the whole set of games, this is an easy recommendation as the one to get.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard zombies are more of a threat this time around (they could be a pain in the previous games as well and were always worrisome when a group was around you) as when you kill one, they don’t leave the gameboard anymore. Instead, their corpses remain until players use a brand new resource, Kerosene, to burn the bodies – else they could return as a more dangerous Red Zombie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of other ways that Resident Evil refines and evolves its gameplay from its older board game siblings, but those are only a taste of what you can expect. If you aren’t looking to get into the whole set of games, this is an easy recommendation as the one out of the three to get.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="the-bleak-outpost-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Bleak Outpost Expansion">Resident Evil: The Bleak Outpost Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214018"><div id="214018" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil: The Bleak Outpost</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $69.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXKBv?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding six new scenarios and two new bosses with Neptune and Plant-42, The Bleak Outpost sends players to new locations, including the Guard House and Aqua Ring. For anyone who fell in love with the base Resident Evil game, this is a great addition. Like the base game, these scenarios can be tackled together as a mini-campaign or as standalone one-off sessions. </p></div><p id="resident-evil-2-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Resident Evil 2: The Board Game">Resident Evil 2: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="213970"><div id="213970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $114.99 USD (Steamforge website price)</li><li><strong>Player</strong>: 1-4 (Best with 2)</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes (per scenario)</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0npJE?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the game that started it all (in terms of Steamforge's board games anyway), Resident Evil 2 introduced tabletop players to the zombie-infested hallways of the Racoon City police station and the other unspeakable horrors of the Umbrella Corporation. In this entry, players assume the roles of Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Ada Wong or Robert Kendo as they go up a gainst the likes of Lickers, Zombie Dogs, and Birkin over the course off eight scenarios. These missions take players from the S.T.A.R.S Office in the Police Station all the way through their harrowing escape out of the Umbrella Laboratory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2 may be the second chronologically (third if you count Zero, but that hasn’t received a board game adaptation yet), so while you may have an urge to visit this game after completing the first, I would recommend fighting it and actually starting here instead. That's because this game lacks some of the refinement and nifty features that pop up and are flesh out in the subsequent titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign of this game is straightforward where one scenario leads directly into the next without any real ability to deviate or tackle them in different orders – an approach that is only found in Resident Evil 2. Other quality-of-life issues also had yet to be worked out, such such as the tiles that you place and build the scenarios with are overly dark, making details hard to see and some games not including the required parts to fasten the life and ammo dials together. There are work arounds for both, and at the end of the day the details on the tiles don’t matter themselves since what matters is more just the shape of them, but it does take away from the experience a little bit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, though, Resident Evil 2 is still a fun game to play with friends. Some scenarios really require you to plan and strategize or risk getting overwhelmed. It's a solid game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil 2 Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="b-files-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="B-Files Expansion">Resident Evil 2 The Board Game: B-Files Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214019"><div id="214019" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2 The Board Game: B-Files Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $54.99USD</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RjOV?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who just can’t get enough Resident Evil 2, The B-files expansion doubles the number of scenarios that you and your friends can play through while also giving you brand new items, enemies, and goal – escape from Mr. X!</p></div><p id="malformations-of-g-b-files-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Malformations of G B-Files Expansion">Resident Evil 2: The Board Game - Malformations of G B-Files Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214020"><div id="214020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2: The Board Game - Malformations of G B-Files Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $32.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4e8q?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This small-box expansion is designed to be played alongside the B-Files expansion.

The Tofu miniature is reason enough to get this expansion.</p></div><p id="resident-evil-3-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Resident Evil 3: The Board Game">Resident Evil 3: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="213971"><div id="213971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 3: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $114.99 USD (Steamforge’s website)</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-4 (Best with 2)</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes (per scenario)</li><li><strong>Ages</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWwZmA?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 3 continues on where the RE2 left off, both storyline-wise and in terms of developing the game mechanics. While this next entry retains a majority of the gameplay that was first introduced in its predecessor, out was the linear scenario approach in favor of giving players options in how they want to tackle exploring the burned-out ruins of Raccoon City. This time around, players can choose to pick up the holsters of Jill, Carlos, Mikhail or Nikolai, with each character having unique skills to help to survive the hellscape while being hunted by the menacing Nemesis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping the linear narrative of its predecessor, Resident Evil 3 gives players some options in how they wish to explore Raccoon City, though similar to the video games, some areas are inaccessible until specific key items are discovered in other areas, that will further open up areas of the city. One of the neat things that Resident Evil 3 does is that the game continues to get more dangerous as the city deteriorates around you, with actions you take and whether or not you succeed or fail in your objectives playing a role in how fast it does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new mechanic, Danger Tracker, reflects how bad things are going, and the worse it gets, the harder things are for players. The new Narrative deck helps keep the game interesting and unique from one play-through to the next. Having to choose whether or not it’s worth it to double back to try and find more resources or press on with what you have really helps to elevate that survival horror sense that the video games are known for.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Component-wise, the only place that this game stumbles with is the “map” of Raccoon City that you navigate around. While the cards are sturdy and feel nice to hold, and the tiles and tokens are solid and fine to punch out, the dashboard featuring the scenario map is on what feels like a small step up from the standard letter paper you would put in your printer, just with a gloss finish to it.  It does its job, but compared to everything else, it certainly is the odd zombie out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are more interested in a more open-ended campaign flow and want to skip over Resident Evil 2, this is a great starting place to get into the board game series with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil 3 Board Game Expansions</strong></h2></div><p id="the-last-escape-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Last Escape Expansion">Resident Evil 3: The Last Escape Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="0195dcc2-f781-49a3-bed4-b2e724443b07" id="214023"><div id="214023" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 3: The Last Escape Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>MSRP</strong>: $44.99</li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXABp?object_uuid=afd33c54-4717-40f9-ba19-26ce3cadd378&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>See it at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding Barry Burton, Brad Vickers, Tyrell Patrick, Marvin Branagh, Dario Rosso, and Murphy Seeker to the roster of playable characters, along with advanced versions of the base game’s cast, all hands are on deck to deal with the new monsters found in this expansion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> fans just spent their first weekend with new playable characters Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, but some are having trouble taking Reed Richards as seriously as the other heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stretchy scientist made his debut with the launch of Season 1 on Friday, January 10, bringing his elastic skills to the battlefield as one of Marvel rivals' first post-launch heroes. His powers as a Duelist allow him to take long swings at one or multiple enemies at a time, while also giving him the option to expand his body and take on more of a tank role. Players are still piecing together how to best use Mister Fantastic against the rest of the roster, but until then, most people just can’t get over how goofy he can be.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SAtREw22fR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SAtREw22fR</a></p>— Wong Updates (@WongUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/WongUpdates/status/1878589238020919326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A character who can contort his body into strange shapes carries a lot of meme potential. You might have already seen some of <a href="https://x.com/MRivalsHub/status/1876629635435241608" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many comparisons to One Piece protagonist Monkey D. Luffy</a>, for example, thanks to Mister Fantastic’s Elastic Strength ability. It’s a bit that’s already gained enough traction for the modding community to create <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1132" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a One Piece custom skin</a> despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-players-are-risking-account-bans-to-mod-the-game-even-after-season-1-clampdown">NetEase cracking down on modding recently</a>. Turning into a rubber bodybuilder is funny on its own, though some fans, including X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/BOOMERANG_117/status/1877883095317426534" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@BOOMERANG_117</u></a>, tapped into their creative side by imagining Marvel Rivals’ Reed Richards without his new beard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all slightly unsettling, but few of the character's elements have attracted jokes like his Reflexive Rubber ability. It’s a useful tool that can be used to turn an enemy’s damage against them, and it also happens to look almost too silly in motion. Using the move sees Mister Fantastic grow to the size of a refrigerator, so you can imagine what walking around like that might look like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ngl I think Mr. Fantastic's design encapsulates everything great about this game," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hzuzb8/comment/m6ug1fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user said</a>.
