            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sumo Digital is stepping away from creating its own IP, making <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">a public statement</a> that it is now going to focus “exclusively on development services for partners.”</p>
<p>The statement justifies this by saying that they need to balance “creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business”. The goal is to become “a premium development partner”, something which is very much in keeping with a good portion of the company’s work to date.</p>


<p>At this time it’s not clear the extent of any associated job losses, though they state that “Unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people. We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care, and compassion.”</p>
<p>Sumo Digital has traditionally been known for their work on other publisher IPs, their most notable games including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/12/19/hands-on-sonic-sega-all-stars-racing/">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/18/littlebigplanet-3-review/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and pulling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/crackdown-3-review/">Crackdown 3</a> out of development hell, but starting with 2017’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/30/snake-pass-review/">Snake Pass</a>, they also sought to produce their own IP and branch out from work-for-hire and co-development contracts – even if these provided plenty of work, such as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/21/hitman-2-review/">Hitman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review/">Forza Horizon 4 &amp; 5</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won’t see the company winding down its Secret Mode publishing label, which has generally been the home for the company’s own IP productions, including last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/stampede-racing-royale-launches-for-free-with-a-dave-the-diver-collab/">Stampede: Racing Royale</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/deathsprint-66-is-a-buzzsaw-of-dystopian-future-racing/">DeathSprint ’66</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a> from subsidiary The Chinese Room. They’ve also been a broader indie publisher, though, with cute underwater adventure Loddlenaut, bike delivery game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>, and neat-and-tidy-’em-up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/11/a-little-to-the-left-review/">A Little to the Left</a>.</p>

<p>Sumo Digital was founded in 2003 in Sheffield, spending six years as a subsidiary to Foundation 9 Entertainment before regaining independence through a management buyout in 2014, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/">being acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The company has grown a huge amount in the last decade, and Sumo Group has grown to around 1,400 employees by 2023, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore. They’ve also further studios including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/14/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-devs-the-chinese-room-have-joined-sumo/">The Chinese Room</a>, Red Kit Games, Lab42, Atomhawk and more.</p>
<p>There’s uncertain times ahead, and hopefully the layoffs and disruption for such a large company – both in the UK and abroad – will be minimal.</p>

            <p>
More Xbox first-party titles have been confirmed for PS5 - and it's good news for strategy fans, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> Edition and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition both on the way. That's alongside a variety of upcoming expansion releases across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
First up for PS5 is Age of Mythology: Retold, a remaster of the 2002 original, which comes to Sony's console on 4th March. This twist on the Age of Empires strategy formula swaps history for monsters and gods as players battle as either the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, or Atlantean pantheons.
</p>
<p>
Its 4th March arrival coincides with the launch of Mythology: Retold's Immortal Pillars expansion. This includes the new Chinese pantheon, 12 new gods with unique powers and mythological units, a nine-level campaign inspired by Chinese mythology, and seven new maps. PlayStation 5 owners can pick it up alongside the base game, but it also comes to PC and Xbox on the same day. Cross-play is supported across all platforms, and all Mythology: Retold updates will hit Xbox, PS5, and PC simultaneously from this point onward.

<p>
Then, sometime this "spring", PlayStation 5 owners can get their hands on Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. This includes all the expansions released for the 1999 original, plus improved visuals, gameplay refinements, cross-play, and more. As with Age of Mythology: Retold, new DLC launches alongside Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's PS5 release, and will be available across all platforms. Microsoft isn't talking specifics yet but says to expect "fresh new content" and "new civilisations for Ranked play."
</p><p>
In related news, Microsoft has also announced two new expansions for Age of Empires 4 in 2025, both focused on "shorter and repeatable experiences". The first of these, Knights of Cross and Rose, arrives this "spring", promising "two well-known armies inspired by history" plus a "solo mode that will challenge even the most skilled strategists." Additional details can be found in <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/">Microsoft's announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Word of Age of Mythology: Retold Edition and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's impending PS5 releases follows last week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-officially-heading-to-playstation-5-this-spring">Forza Horizon 5 is heading to Sony's console</a>. It continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">multi-console release strategy</a> announced for Microsoft's first-party titles last year - one that's so far seen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment come to PlayStation, with  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 all on the way.
</p>
<p>
The start of 2025 also brought reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">suggesting Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator are also PS5-bound.</a> Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.

			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-sims-25-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Electronic Arts</a> is celebrating 25 iconic years of The Sims. This life simulation title has brought people to gaming that typically wouldn't go near games, allowing people to share their creativity and revel in the chaos and madness of Sims. It went from a very humble title with Comic Sans writing to one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with a million-lifetime players to date.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Sims, there have been some major drops, as well as news regarding updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/">The Sims 4</a>. First and foremost, The Sims 1 and Sims 2 were released as part of a Birthday Bundle celebration. While this news was exciting to most long-term Sims players, there have already been a host of issues, with the games just either not booting or constantly crashing. As a result, it's led to a frustrated community, with many of them refunding the games. The issues have been acknowledged, with the team dedicated to fixing them in future updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you want to try your luck, The Sims and The Sims 2 are available via the EA app, Epic Games Store, and Steam for PCs running Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 will also be getting a major base game update today, which adds 70 new in-game items for all players to enjoy, as well as a special event named The Sims 4 Blast From the Past Event. This will take you through a journey of nostalgia and memories while unlocking new items and content in your game by participating in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play The Sims FreePlay, there are special events to participate in with rewards, as well as 25 days of in-game gifts, which include some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history.</p>
<p>In the event you want some<a href="https://shopthesims.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tangible merch</a> that you can showcase in your day-to-day life, there is a limited edition merch collection that features retro pins, a 2000s-themed gamer mat, t-shirts, and more.</p>
<p>For the official 25th anniversary, which is today, a 25-hour live stream is beginning on The Sims YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok channels, where you'll be able to see 25 hours of gameplay, giveaways, and more. This includes people like Doja Cat, Trixie Mattel, Ironmouse, Julien, and more. The live stream will begin at 2 PM PST / 5 PM ET / 10 P GMT. The graphic above showcases the names of the people that will be appearing in the 25-hour stream.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up The Legacy Collection for old-time's sake?</p>

Rather, the gamepad is so damn comfortable to use that it feels like GameSir might as well have taken a mold of my hands to make the Tarantula Pro. I’ve had trouble returning to a DualSense pad since using it.</p><h2 id="h219345"><a id=""></a>The GameSir Tarantula Pro is a symmetrical stick delight</h2><p>I grew up as a PlayStation kid, so I have an affinity for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symmetrical (in-line) sticks</a></span> on my controllers. I was an especially big fan of the DualShock 4 for this reason. But despite having big hands, the PS5's DualSense has always felt slightly too bulky for me, as if my fingers never quite land in the right spot without holding the controller just a bit unnaturally. The moment I laid hands on the GameSir Tarantula Pro, however, it felt like returning home after a long trip away.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable difference for me is how my index fingers rest on the Xbox-style LT/RT triggers on the top of the controller much more naturally than they do with a DualSense controller. When you factor in how easy it is to swap them to hair triggers for even faster response time, it’s made FPS games feel better to play than ever before. There are even two customizable buttons on the back of the controller that sit in the perfect spot for my middle fingers to use—but nearby switches can retract them when not in use, allowing them to sit flush with the rest of the controller’s back. It’s a dream.</p><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t just comfortable, though. At only $69.99, it’s also an affordable entry point for folks seeking a “pro” controller. Here’s a basic rundown of my favorite features:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>It works on PC or Switch </strong>and features mechanically interchangeable buttons to accommodate which of the two platforms you’re using it on at the time. </li><li><strong>It works on iOS/Android</strong>.</li><li>There are two customizable back buttons that feel great to use.</li><li>I’ve seen solid battery life out of it so far, and there are no signs of that slowing down.</li><li>It has multiple trigger modes, each having a purpose based on the type of game you’re playing.</li></ul><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t perfect, however. It may be extremely comfortable to hold, but it trades affordability for a bland visual style and a build quality that doesn’t feel quite as premium as its feature set. Also, so much of its functionality is trapped behind button combination shortcuts that it feels like you need a journal to keep up with them all. Oh, and it’s kind of a bummer that you have to shell out an extra $10 for a version with a charging stand.</p><p>There’s no shortage of controllers to choose from these days—especially on PC—and the best choice for you is the one that has all of the features you need at a price you can afford. Though it might lack some features that more hardcore, sweaty pro players might desire, the comfort and functionality of the Tarantula Pro makes it an excellent choice, especially for casual gaming where comfort might be the most valued trait. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Once you’ve got a few hours into Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll find yourself revelling in pomp and circumstance at a wedding in Semine. This is one of the pivotal moments of this open-world RPG, but it has a particular task that might be tricky for some.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the wedding mission, you’re prompted to congratulate the newlyweds, but the bride and groom are nowhere to be seen. This can leave you searching for a while, as the location they’re in is not at all obvious – and you might never think to look there.</p>



<p>In this short guide, I’ll help you find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-find-the-bride-and-groom-in-kingdom-come">Find the Bride and Groom in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>The wedding mission is one of the highlights of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It’s the culmination of several hours of gameplay, and hopefully, you’ll be well-prepared to deal with everything it offers. In one moment, you’ll be duelling guards, and in the next, you’ll be procuring special alcohol for Moravian guests.</p>



<p>It’s a busy time.</p>



<p>At the end of the mission, you prepare to leave the wedding, but first, Henry of Skalitz wants to congratulate the newlyweds, but they’ve disappeared and nobody knows where they are.</p>



<p>Here’s where you’ll find the <strong>bride</strong> (Agnes) at the wedding:</p>



<p>Head away from the ceremony area through the arch leading to the dining area – nearby where the Moravian crew is sitting. Directly ahead of you will be a dead-end with a door to the left, with a guard posted outside. If you head in there, you’ll see it leads into a wine and beer cellar – it’s in here that you’ll find the bride.</p>



<p>If you’ve come here previously with the Moravian task, you’ll already have evacuated the strict guard from inside. Otherwise, you might need to distract him some other way. Either way, this is where to find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil what happens when you’ve found the bride – have fun!</p>

It’s set in a dark fantasy world in which, once a year, a powerful being called the Paintress wakes and paints a number on her monolith. When she does, everyone of that age vanishes from the earth. As the game kicks off, the Paintress is going to wake soon and paint the number 33. You plays as Expedition 33, a group of 33-year-olds who plan to kill the Paintress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat sounds like a real selling point for the game. It’s turn-based, but you do a lot of other things besides choosing attacks for your expeditioners. You can dodge, parry, and counter incoming attacks. You can chain combos together by pressing buttons in a rhythm, and you can use a free-aim system to target enemy weak points. It looks pretty cool.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pga-tour-2k25-the-final-preview.1100127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you took a Family Feud-style survey of which pro sports simulation video game series people would most want 2K to take a crack at that they’re not already making, a resurrection of NFL 2K would easily be the number-one answer. Heck, pro golf might not even be the second or third answer (hello, MLB and NHL). But the company is nevertheless returning for a third round with PGA Tour 2K25, and after playing for a couple of hours, there’s a lot to like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, developer HB Studios has been honing its golf game for quite a while now, having made The Golf Club starting a decade ago before signing on with 2K and rebranding to PGA Tour 2K in 2020. The team’s experience and maturity shine through in 2K25, as I had a hard time finding any glaring issues in my hands-on. Is it the best-looking sports game? No. Would it be nice to have more real-life courses? Sure. (2K25 does bring the PGA Championship, US Open, and the Open Championship.) Was the framerate surprisingly choppy on PC when I’d press Y to survey each new hole? Yup. But actually digging into this year’s offering was just fun.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It started with the upgraded EvoSwing mechanic. You have a few different options, and playing with a controller, I preferred the right stick option, in which you pull down to wind up, and press forward to strike the ball and follow through. You can set this to be forgiving, or it can be set to be very much not forgiving with the higher difficulty settings, whereby an errant flick of your thumb in one direction or another might yield a wicked slice or hook. Conversely, there are also lower difficulty settings (Perfect Swing) for those just looking to have a chill, stress-free time, in which 2K25 isn’t as punitive on missed inputs in an effort to try and keep you moving and advancing. Furthermore, you can tap LB to shape your shots, giving you additional control over where the ball will go. HB Studios also says the ball physics have been improved, and I like that you can also move laterally in the tee box to adjust your tee shot if, say, a tree up ahead gets slightly in the way of your preferred drive. It certainly helped that I started by playing as Tiger Woods, this year’s cover athlete, who as we all know is pretty darn good at this sport.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I got offered a role in a movie with Christopher “Shooter McGavin” McDonald – who, yes, is in the game, albeit not as his famous Happy Gilmore character for obvious licensing reasons.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, MyCareer has been given a boost, implementing narrative mechanics we’ve seen in other sports games to reasonably entertaining effect. I got offered a role in a movie with Christopher “Shooter McGavin” McDonald – who, yes, is in the game, albeit not as his famous Happy Gilmore character for obvious licensing reasons – where I could choose to play a hero or villain, and my choice would affect which MyCareer stats got boosted. Gear earned by cashing in your earned VC will also affect your stats, while your skills are also upgradeable by playing and, naturally, winning. The developers have also added Quests, which are broad goals they can refresh weekly or really whenever, such as getting 10 birdies in a row.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for MyPlayer, I didn’t want to spend my entire demo time trying to recreate a perfect facsimile of myself, but even noodling around with the player creator for a few minutes was enough to get me reasonably close. You’ve got skill trees to dig into now as well, which is a welcome upgrade. Sadly, I didn’t get to try the multiplayer options, which sound like good casual fun including ranked matchmaking and cross-platform Societies (think: groups or clubs). I have fond memories of shooting the breeze with my friends in Links 2004 for the original Xbox, and what PGA Tour 2K25 promises sounds like it might recreate all of that and more. I appreciate that there are also asynchronous multiplayer options if you and your buddies live in wildly different time zones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PGA Tour 2K25 is admittedly a bit difficult to preview in that it seems to do everything reasonably well without faceplanting in any one single area. It makes it a bit tough to get excited about, admittedly, but it does seem like a solid bet to be worth picking up for golf fans and/or those looking for a low-stress game. Fortunately, you can check it out for yourself without spending a dime, as a playable demo of PGA Tour 2K25 is available as of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Breakout Beyond is a twist on Atari's brick-breaker, keeping the same paddle-and-ball setup but having it all move sideways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Choice Provisions, the studio behind the BIT.TRIP series, Breakout Beyond has a sideways progression path as players move left-to-right. Breaking bricks is still the objective, and as combos ramp up lights and effects intensify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Special bricks can flip on some fantastic effects too, ranging from massive explosions to an actual laser cannon. 72 levels are planned for Breakout Beyond, alongside an unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard. If you don't want to break bricks alone, Breakout Beyond also has local two-player co-op as an option.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Breakout Beyond was originally set to be an exclusive game for the Intellivision Amico back in 2020, but Atari has since agreed to acquire and complete development of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're thrilled to be able to bring this gem to our players," Atari's senior director of games publishing Ethan Stearns said. "The team thought it was a brilliant concept, preserving the heart of Breakout's gameplay while also giving the formula a completely new spin. Breakout Beyond is a worthy new entry into the Breakout pantheon, and we can't wait to see the insane combos brick-breakers will make."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Amico, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/22/intellivision-amico-console-revealed-with-exclusive-games-coming-in-2020"><u>announced in 2018 with hopes of a 2020 release</u></a>, still hasn't seen the light of day.

<p>In Battlefield 2042, Portal featured maps, weapons, and vehicles from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-portal-mode-details-revealed-in-new-dev-interview/1100-6494416/" data-ref-id="1100-6494416">previous titles in the franchise</a>, namely Battlefield 1942, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. While it is unknown what Portal could include in the next Battlefield game, Flakfire said developers told him that Portal could be one of the features that players test in the Battlefield Labs program.</p><p>At the time of 2042's initial release, publisher <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/game-overview/modes/battlefield-portal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts called Battlefield Portal</a> a "love letter" to the franchise's fans.

		<p>Following the mixed reception to its launch last week, a second hotfix update is now available for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> on PC, as Nixxes look to address the main pain points that users have felt with the port.</p>
<p>In particular they’ve sought to stamp out crashes and stability issues as much as possible – though they also hazard that you really, really should update your drivers to the very latest version to have Spider-Man 2 compatibility built in.</p>


<p>Beyond that, they’ve fixed an Achievements bug that was causing them to fail – this will work retroactively upon loading a save file – and fixed a DualShock 4 button prompt bug.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Spider-Man 2 PC v1.202.0.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Achievements not being awarded on some configurations.</li>
<li>Triangle and Square button prompts are now displayed correctly when using a DualShock 4 controller with Steam Input enabled.</li>
<li>Resolved a frame rate related bug that could block players during the mission ‘Show Me New York’.</li>
</ul>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve been playing with our PCs and generally found that the game has been fine following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/500563872868991406">the first hotfix last Friday</a>, both in terms of stability and performance. Hopefully the game quickly gets up to snuff for those that are running into problems.</p>

			<p>For fans of Age of Empires, today's announcement is going to feel like a massive celebration. The developers of Age of Empires have shared that there will be new content coming to multiple games, as well as their exciting announcement of reaching 60 million Age of Empire players worldwide.</p>
<p>Diving into the updates one by one, PlayStation 5 fans are in luck. Both Age of Mythology: Retold and <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-might-be-coming-to-playstation/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> will be making their way to PlayStation. Age of Mythology: Retold will be launching on PlayStation 5 in correlation with the Immortal Pillars expansion being released on March 4. This expansion will introduce the Chinese pantheon, as well as new maps to explore, myth units, and added gameplay features. For those who want to get their hands on this expansion, pre-orders are now live. Those who own Age of Mythology: Retold - Premium Edition will automatically receive the expansion on day one.</p>
<p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition will launch on PlayStation 5 later in the Spring. When both titles are released, they will feature content parity across all platforms, as well as cross-play support. This title is currently available on Xbox Game Pass and Steam.</p>
<p>In addition to these two games being released for PlayStation, it's been confirmed by the developers that new content will be released for Age of Empires IV this year. It will receive two pieces of DLC in 2025, with the first one launching this Spring. The first DLC will be titled "Knights of Cross and Rose" and will give players the opportunity to lead two well-known armies that are inspired by history. It will also introduce a new solo. More information regarding the second DLC will be shared at a later date, most likely once the first DLC has been released.</p>
<p>For those who play Age of Empires Mobile, February will be a big month for you. There are new features and events to participate in, including a new campaign named Battle of Dawn, as well as a new event named Stellar Glory. For Valentine's Day, Age of Empires Mobile will be getting exclusive Valentine's Day cosmetics, as well as three events to participate in that are themed around Princess Josephine's Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p>More information and screenshots are available on the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Age of Empires website</a>, so you can see what the game will look like with the introduction of the new content in all games. There is also some concept art available to look at, as well as a gift code for those who play Age of Empires Mobile.</p>

		<p>Crash-tastic racer sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>&nbsp;is barrelling its way to a PC Early Access release on 20th March 2025, Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On day one, the early access version of Wreckfest 2 will have the core game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer, and this will provide a great testbed for the game’s fundamental gameplay, with all the racing for up to 24 drivers, the overhauled physics and renewed visuals.</p>
<p>Bugbear will feed in more content over time, including the revamped career mode that will adapt to individual playstyles. Online racing will have a new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues, though it’s not clear if they will be there on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/car-smashing-sequel-wreckfest-2-has-been-announced/">Announced last summer</a>, Bugbear previewed their&nbsp;new ROMU engine for demolition physics and dynamic simulation, which looks to take the smash-happy racing to new levels. There’s also a brand new sound system, which they believe to be one of the very best and more accurate in a racing game.</p>

<p>Another big new feature is the car customiser, which allows you to change colours per body part, add layered decals, but then also go deeper into making your car look like a bit of a wreck by painting on rust and body damage. I’m sure there’s going to be some great car liveries made in Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, Wreckfest 2 is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Wreckfest was a smash hit when it first launched back in 2018, though we reviewed it for the original console launch, with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/29/wreckfest-review/">9/10 Wreckfest review</a>. We said, “Wreckfest is a surprising triumph in blending the best that sim and arcade racers have to offer in an explosive and visually gratifying package. A few visual issues and overly aggressive AI do little to spoil one of the best driving games of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bugbear gave the game years of support after that, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/wreckfest-native-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-version-how-to-upgrade/">a big upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> that brought 60FPS racing to consoles. I’m sure we can expect similar plans for Wreckfest 2.</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has released the first gameplay trailer for MLB The Show 25, and with it came reveals of new features coming to this year’s game.</p>



<p>MLB The Show 25 features a number of updates coming to each of the game’s core modes. With Road to the Show, players will be able to now play in high school and college before making it to the big leagues. Colleges confirmed in the game so far—based on the trailer—include UCLA, LSU, TCU, Cal-State Fullerton, Vanderbilt, Texas, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  There are also metal bats in the game, replicating the play and sound from lower-levels of baseball.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moving on to Franchise Mode, Sony San Diego is touting a new “Front Office Experience”. According to the studio, “choices matter, consequences are real, and time is precious as a revitalized Free Agency system adds risk/reward elements, strategy, and excitement to the pursuit of the top free agents each offseason”.</p>



<p>For Diamond Dynasty, the game’s card-collecting mode, there will be two new game modes within. The first is called  Diamond Quest, a rogue-like offline mode. The second is an online league-style mode called Weekend Classic. </p>



<p>Other new features revealed include the addition of more quick-time events, first-person cameras, and more. More details and deep dives into the modes will come as part of Sony San Diego’s pre-launch roadmap that you can see below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>MLB The Show 25 launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. For the first time in years, the game won’t be available day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>It feels like we’ve not had an amazing Battlefield game for a long time. This is why EA is giving its all to make Battlefield 2025’s release as good as it can be and bring the franchise back to the forefront of FPS gaming with a bang in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2025 is exactly what I’m looking for right now. Call of Duty is still great but can be arcadey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> and Overwatch are compelling Hero shooters, and The Finals is lacking something, but adds the delicious destruction I seek. Battlefield has always provided something a bit different, and (in my opinion) we haven’t had a memorable entry since 2016’s Battlefield 1.</p>



<p>Early indicators are EA is inventing a lot of time, resources, and manpower into Battlefield 2025, so let’s check out what we know about the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-the-next-battlefield-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield release</a> and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-release-period">Battlefield 2025 Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom. Credit to Battlefield Studios – Official Battlefield Labs Reveal Teaser video on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but Battlefield 2025 is being eyed up for a potential 2025 release, and multiple reports seem to verify this.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve reported previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s next Battlefield game was aiming for 2025</a>. A few months later Vince Zempella—heading the new Battlefield title—hinted Battlefield was returning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern-day combat, also in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>EA hasn’t come out and said a 2025 date is happening, but it seems extremely likely. I highly doubt it’s going to stay as “Battlefield 2025” either, and we could finally be getting the long-awaited <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> many have been asking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-battlefield-labs-testing-explained">Battlefield 2025 Battlefield Labs Testing Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield Labs is described as the “The most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history” and is a full-on cohesive alliance of multiple developers and players to create the ultimate Battlefield 2025 game.</strong></p>



<p>February 3 saw the first mention of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> project. It’s a series of tests throughout the pre-alpha phase (and probably beta testing) to continually ascertain the quality of the product. Consistent player feedback is looking to help the four studios working on Battlefield 2025: <strong>DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, </strong>and <strong>Criterion</strong>.</p>



<p>We don’t how long <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/announcing-battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs</a> will last, but you can try to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> and test the potential Battlefield 6 entry—providing feedback of your own.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-battlefield-6-gameplay-revealed">First Battlefield 6 Gameplay Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s hope for a good one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The first-ever footage of Battlefield 2025 AKA Battlefield 6 was shown off during the Battlefield Labs demonstration. It showed explosive gameplay, destructible environments, vehicles, high-octane weapons, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>It looks spectacular for pre-alpha footage, but we’ve been fooled by Battlefield before. Nevertheless, you can check out the reveal for yourself below.</p>

<p>What does Battlefield 2025 need to do differently from Battlefield 2024—and even Battlefield 5—to make itself relevant again and bring the player base back? Is this the last chance saloon for EA and Battlefield as a whole? Get involved with a comment below.</p>

            <p>
We were big fans of developer Bugbear Entertainment's demolition derby racer Wreckfest when it launched back in 2018, so there was some excitement when a sequel was announced last year. And now, the studio has now confirmed similarly enthusiastic sorts can slam pedal to the metal from 20th March, when Wreckfest 2 launches into Steam early access.
</p>
<p>
Wreckfest 2 promises what Bugbear is calling the "next evolution of full-contact racing", and there's talk of an overhauled physics engine, more intricate component damage simulation, and "even higher crash fidelity" - all working together to conjure "absolute vehicular mayhem".
</p>
<p>
Course-wise, Bugbear is promising a blend of high-speed circuits, "crazy courses with obstacles and jumps", plus intersections and oncoming traffic. Initially these'll be available in Racing, Derby, and multiplayer modes - supporting up to 34 players - with more to come. Sometime into Wreckfrest 2's early access release, for instance, Bugbear is introducing a revamped career mode designed to adapt to individuals' playstyles, plus a skill-based matchmaking system and server queues for online players.

<p>
Vehicle customisation also has a major role, and players can spruce up their cars with new armour and component types suited to different driving approaches. New components will arrive as early access continues, with other future additions set to include tournaments, high-score challenges putting players in "unconventional vehicles", and mod support.
</p><p>
Bugbear says the goal of early access is to ensure Wreckfest 2 is "shaped by [player] feedback" from day one. And while there's no indication of how long early access will last as yet, the original Wreckfest notably remained in early access for four years. The results, however, were worth it, with Martin Robison calling it a game of "primal pleasures" and "little by way of pretension" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wreckfest-2-gothic-1-remake-gameplay-and-everything-else-from-thq-nordics-showcase">his Recommended review</a>.
</p>
<p>
So if you're eager to get behind the wheel as Wreckfest 2 heads toward the early access finish line, you can do so when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/">it comes to Steam</a> on 20th March.

As of the end of 2024, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sold over 150 million units</a> in the eight years since its release. That’s an impressive number, and yet…that’s <em>still </em>not enough to make it the company’s best selling piece of hardware – a distinction that belongs to the humble Nintendo DS – but it’s getting close.</p><p>The company released its earnings report earlier this week and the numbers don’t look great. Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">with the Switch 2</a> tantalizingly close to launch. And in light of all that, it still sold almost 10 million units. But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and with new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is set to arrive on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atari-vcs-2600-console-crypto-nft-financial-report-1849920146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atari-vcs-2600-console-crypto-nft-financial-report-1849920146">Atari’s weird PC-in-a-box console.</a></span> </p><p>Now, if you just watch this trailer, you might assume this is just a new <em>Breakout</em> game that looks cool and move on. And that’s probably what Atari is hoping most people do. However, this particular version of <em>Breakout</em> has a weird history that goes back to 2019 and the doomed Amico. </p><p>Remember the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-tommy-tallarico-delay-debts-layoffs-1849037546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-tommy-tallarico-delay-debts-layoffs-1849037546">Amico</a></span>? Probably not. Here’s a very short explanation: In 2018 video game composer and jerk Tommy Tallarico announced plans to create a new Intellivision-branded console focused on affordable games and family fun. A number of games (mostly ports of mobile and web titles) were planned to launch alongside the Amico, including a new version of <em>Breakout </em>developed by Choice Provisions. Of all the Amico games, this new <em>Breakout </em>was the one most people were excited about. </p><p>Here’s the reveal trailer for Amico’s Breakout game: </p><p>And then years of mismanagement, delays, covid-19, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174">NFT nonsense</a></span> and more occurred, and here we are in 2025 and the Amico is still not on shelves. If you want to learn more about the car crash that is the Amico, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271">click here</a></span>. </p><p> Anyway, in 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atari bought the Intellivision brand and its games</a></span>, but not the Amico console. For a while now, people have wondered what happened to that cool looking <em>Breakout </em>game. Was it doomed to never see the light of day? Nope! Atari realized it had a possible banger on its hands and is finally getting around to releasing the game on actual platforms people own and use. </p><p>That brings us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Breakout Beyond</em></a></span>, the “new” game announced today for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. (No release date was provided.) It’s nice to see this thing escaping the Amico to get a chance to launch and be played. Hopefully <em>Breakout Beyond </em>is worth the wait. At least now nobody needs to buy an Amico, assuming the doomed console actually comes out one day. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
