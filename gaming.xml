            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launched in just under a month on 21st October, Team Ninja and Platinum Games have shared some new gameplay and talked about some key new difficulty features for the game, including an easier “Hero Mode” that adds gameplay assists.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Difficulty Design | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-ccI2SOsD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hero Mode is a nice way of saying Easy Mode, and sits below the Normal difficulty. The main difference is that it adds assists like auto-dodge and auto-guard, so that new players can acclimatise themselves to the ninja action. You can fiddle with these assists at any time in the menus, and switch between Hero, Normal and Hard difficulties through a playthrough, as you need.</p>
<p>Master Ninja difficulty, however, cannot be switched to or from mid-run. This means that it will remain the preserve of the ultra skilful diehards of the franchise.</p>
<p>Thankfully you will still have access to the training mode. This, possibly taking inspiration from fighting games – will let you drop into a training room to practice your attack strings and defensive manoeuvres.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, and it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>Plus, Mech Zangie-F returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Ahead of her debut on <strong>15th October 2025</strong>, C. Viper gets the spotlight with a brand new gameplay trailer for Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <strong>Year 3 Ultimate / Character Pass</strong>, C. Viper (or Crimson Viper) was originally introduced to the series in the 2008 entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>. She retains her signature moves such as Burning Kick, Thunder Dash, Knuckled Pursuit, and Seismic Hammer. A brand new move called Focus Force has also been introduced, allowing you to bring up a protective barrier before launching your counterattack.</p>
<p>In addition to her standard outfit, C. Viper will also boast her Street Fighter IV attire for those who want to inject a bit of nostalgia into their gaming. As for the new outfit, Capcom has provided two pieces of artwork in its recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/544495527868235881">blog</a> to give you a good glimpse at Viper in all her glory.</p>
<figure><a title="C. Viper 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c38f7ff28d0b/c-viper-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In addition to a brand new character, the Year 3 Pass also introduces an extra outfit for Zangief. This is based directly on Mech Zangie-F from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/marvel_super_heroes_vs_street_fighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a>, though its overall design has been updated accordingly for this new release. It looks pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The additional outfit will be available on 15th October alongside C. Viper, but that's not all. Owners of the Year 3 Pass can also look forward to two addition characters in the coming months: Alex and Ingrid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox is once again hosting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-for-later-in-september-heres-what-to-expect">a Tokyo Game Show broadcast in 2025,</a> and this time it's happening today, September 25, at 3am PT/6am ET/11am BST/7pm JST. While we don't know exactly what will be featured in the show, Microsoft did share that it will "feature titles from our creative teams, alongside exciting updates from our partners in Japan, across Asia and around the world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what they announce, we will be right here covering all the biggest moments live, so we encourage you to keep checking back to ensure you don't miss any of the reveals, trailers, gameplay, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon 6 Speeds to Japan in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show ended with our first look at Forza Horizon 6, which is actually located in Japan and will be released in 2026. While we didn't get to see actual cars in the open world, we were given a glimpse of a beautiful vista featuring Mount Fuji after a few fun nods to the series' past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans’ wish lists, so we’re excited to finally be bringing this much-requested location to players in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>,” explains art director Don Arceta to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>. “Japan has such a unique culture – from cars, to music, to fashion – that make it perfect for the next Horizon setting. As with any Horizon title, we want to make sure we do the country justice in terms of authentic representation and Horizon open world playability – and now is the right time to realize that fully for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team also shared that the technical side of the equation is now in the right place to bring this vision to life, and they even gave the example of Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels DLC, which helped the team develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for where else Forza Horizon 6 will take us, the team isn't quite ready to share any more locations. However, they did give us a small tease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan. For those unfamiliar, Chan has previously been seen in Eternals, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits," the official description reads of the brand-new character. "With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 Gameplay Overview Features Master Ninja Difficulty Action and Training Mode</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of its release on October 21, Ninja Gaiden took center stage at Xbox's TGS stream to showcase not only its training mode that will let you practice combos and weapons in a safe place, but also its Master Ninja mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlocked after beating Story Mode, Master Ninja will challenge players with feature late-game enemies in earlier chapters, enhanced AI, a greater number of enemies at once, and much more. For those looking for an even greater challenge, there is a setting called Death Wish mode where "growth elements are reset, and difficulty can be escalated towards an even harsher extreme." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Gets a Story Trailer, First Two Monster Hunter Stories Games Headed to Xbox in November</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new story trailer was revealed for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Reflection, and it was also revealed that the original Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin will be headed to Xbox Series X/S on November 14, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bruce Lee Is Joining Hitman: World of Assassination as Your Partner</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The legendary Bruce Lee is joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner "against the Dragon" later today. 47 will need to identify threats and protect Bruce Lee and work together with him to bring down this threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee will play a character named Agent Lee, a character trying to infiltrate the Concorn Union in Hong Kong. The mission, called The Infiltrator, will take place at the Himmapan Hotel in Bangkok, where the Concord Union is hosting a secret international martial arts tournament. Agent Lee needs to win this tournament and identify the leader of the Concorn Union, and he needs 47 to help him do so. There will even be new mechanics to help 47 be the ultimate protector, which is a change from his usual missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Infiltrator will be available from September 25 - November 20.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's World Update 20 Is Out Today and Adds a Lot of Detail to Japan Locations</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's World Update 20 is out today and adds a ton of detail to locations in Japan, including Mount Fuji, Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, Naruto's Otsuka Museum of Art, the Port of Kobe, Osaka Castle, Kyoto, Todaiji Temple, and so many more. In total, there are 23 areas of interest and 67 points of interest to explore, five new airports, more immersive missions, and it's all free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and the update will also add Local Legend #22: NAMC YS-11 for players to fly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gungrave Gore Blood Heat Lets You Dualwield Guns and Use a Massive One As a Weapon <em>and</em> a Shield</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunegrave Gore Blood Heat is a remake of 2022's Gungrave Gore and its "newly added systems preserve the legacy while delivering a modern and more explosive feel." These updates will be felt in level design, motion, visuals, player interactions, combat system, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, you'll be playing as Beyond the Grave, who was once known as Brandon Heat, and will have full access to his dual Cerberus pistols and the gigantic Death Hauler that can be used as a weapon and a shield.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-september-2025-everything-announced]]></content:encoded>

"This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s Japan. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaHorizon6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ForzaHorizon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/D6HngHj43g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D6HngHj43g</a></p>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1971165411119943871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a> blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with art director Don Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise.

"To boil it down, most simply, it's [when] I throw out a little guy, and if there's another little guy it could fight, they fight,'" she said. "If there's no little guy there, they start idling and moving around a bit. If I point in a certain direction, my little guy can go that way. And if they encounter something aggro, they get into a fight automatically."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's been a lot of confusion online about the scope of the patent—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how could Nintendo and The Pokémon Company patent summoning creatures into battle?</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and how it impacts the broader video game industry. What's crucial about the patent is that it's&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;simply patenting summoning a creature into battle; for a game to be infringing, it would have to mimic the whole system, not just a part of it. Still, there's an anxiety to it all: Could Nintendo and The Pokémon Company come after other games with similar mechanics, as it has with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/production-collective-midnighters-launches-to-create-and-support-long-lasting-businesses-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Production collective Midnighters launches to 'create and support long-lasting businesses'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">René Otto,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://deviantlegal.com/about-us/">video game attorney and Deviant Legal founder</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, told Game Developer the patent doesn't necessarily mean Nintendo and The Pokémon Company now have a "monopoly on creature capturing and taming," or even auto-battling. "Instead, Nintendo has the exclusive right to use the combination of mechanics as described in the awarded patent for as long as the patent is deemed valid," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another question is whether or not the patent is valid—or, rather, whether it would hold up if challenged? The patent has already been awarded, and there's no undoing that without a legal challenge, which is unlikely, McLean said; it's expensive in both money and time to challenge a patent. But there's still debate as to whether it would hold up if challenged, centered around the idea of whether the patent covers an idea or not. You can't patent ideas, McLean noted. "There's so much case law trying to figure out whether a patent is an idea," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Nintendo and other large companies have very good lawyers who are very good at drafting ideas to sound like software.&quot;">"Nintendo and other large companies have very good lawyers who are very good at drafting ideas to sound like software."</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-claims-unknown-world-founders-stole-what-essentially-amounts-to-a-blueprint-for-subnautica-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton claims Unknown Worlds founders stole 'what essentially amounts to a blueprint for Subnautica'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Patenting software makes things complicated.&nbsp;"It's very easy to talk about an idea that happens on software and make it sound like the software is new and useful and&nbsp;non-obvious," McLean continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But if you boil away all the software language, what the [United States Patent and Trademark Office] should be doing is saying, 'Is this an idea that happens on software, or is this software that executes an idea to the point that the software is the thing that's unique, non-obvious.' It gets very muddled, and Nintendo and other large companies have very good lawyers who are very good at drafting ideas to sound like software."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/12403397?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJmNDcwMjQzOC00NTYzLTQxMmMtODY0OC01YWE5M2E4MmE4ZmUiLCJ2ZXIiOiJmNGU3MjJiOC0yZjdmLTRkYTAtYjM2MC0wMzcyZjk3MGRjMWUiLCJleHAiOjB9">You can see this in how the software processing is referenced in the patent</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have filed the patent as relating "to a storage medium, an information processing system, an information processing apparatus, and a game processing method for executing a game in which a plurality of characters battle with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, should game developers be worried?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McLean said the issue at hand isn't necessarily this one patent. There are hundreds of other patents—&nbsp;belonging to companies other than Nintendo—that exist in this complex space. "We're going to get to a point where developers are going to have to know about hundreds of patents to know if their specific systems—not just summoning, but tons of other things that are in games," she said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-applovin-leaders-establish-casual-mobile-studio-cheer" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former AppLovin leaders establish casual mobile studio Cheer</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The&nbsp;United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)&nbsp;is behind on games, McLean said. It's really hard for an examiner to assess whether something has been done before, or solves a new problem , or is nonobvious in general because video games are long. There are a lot of them, and they're not always easy to access—especially older ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo provided the patent examiner a link to its own website as a reference, McLean said.

With Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's new patent, the examiner looked at other patents, but doesn't appear to have looked at other games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And there's no easy answer for this issue under the USPTO. Big companies may be able to take on patents they think are invalid, but independent developers or smaller studios without a ton of capital simply won't be able to take on that fight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Corporations, like Nintendo, have shown that they're willing to enforce their patents. The company is currently suing&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;developer Pocketpair over three patents related to catching creatures, aiming the ball one throws at said creatures, and riding on them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not that patents are inherently bad, according to McLean. They're meant to reward innovation, not hinder it. But the system can create an environment of anxiety around infringing, even if it's unlikely. Otto said that patent descriptions can be "abstract and vague."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It casts this giant shroud of anxiety that's maybe OK for the big boys, for the triple-A studios that have enough lawyers on their team to assess these things constantly, but for the little indie devs, it just doesn't make sense for the industry in this way," McLean added.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-does-nintendo-s-new-pok-mon-patent-actually-mean-for-game-developers-]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remasters come sooner every generation, it seems. Gungrave GORE Blood Heat has just been announced, a fully rebuilt version of Gungrave GORE.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gungrave GORE Blood Heat – Announce Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U90lcQ3_aHY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blood Heat brings the game to a new engine – Unreal Engine 5 – with enhanced visual quality and modernised systems as well. Which is odd, because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE first launched in 2022</a> and was already on current generation consoles.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the game can’t be improved further. There’s new systems, more refined characters and background visuals, the return of heritage, exclusive new characters and more.</p>
<p>Gungrave GORE Blood Heat is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. Also Game Pass.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2022, we said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/01/gungrave-gore-review/">Gungrave GORE,</a> “Gungrave G.O.R.E is a decent game. It’s not the best shooter, but it is often very entertaining if just for the spectacle. It has a few issues, mostly in level design, and the story isn’t particularly memorable, but there’s plenty of fun to be had in chainsawing your enemies with a transforming coffin.”</p>

            <p>After claiming they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-boasts-a-ring-of-instakill-dooooooooom-and-the-playtest-kicks-off-soon">invented "the most dangerous ring in gaming"</a> earlier this month, EA and DICE have released a fresh <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> campaign trailer that sees a soldier bloke deploy yet another 'the most something in something' line. Yep, amid a bunch of the usual militarying about, a man teases a battle over "the most strategic rock in the history of warfare".</p>
<p>Maybe it's just because there was far less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">helicopter boomage</a> in this look at the conflict between Dagger 13 and evil private goons Pax Armata, but the line's struck me.

<p>First of all, the trailer's above if you want to give it a watch. The line about strategic rocks comes at around the 40 second mark, with private military corp Pax Armata seemigly on the verge of securing this most strategic of stones. Naturally, you and your buddies "elite Marine Raiders unit" Dagger 13 can't be having that, hence the next line being "Want to help our friends take back this rock?". </p><p>Does history have enough strategic - or strategically significant to be gramatically correct - warfare rocks for it be worth crowning one king, I found myself asking, responding to a question with a question in a fashion that'd definitely get me kicked out of Dagger 13. Having racked my brain for five seconds, these are the ones I've come up with, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gibraltar, which is the site of the rock being teased here. It has plenty of strategical warfare history, having been the <a href="https://www.gibmuseum.gi/our-history/military-history/great-siege-of-gibraltar">site of a great siege</a> during the American Revolutionary War and played a role in World War 2. Control over it's also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-39478176">long been disputed between the UK and Spain</a>, because colonialism.</li>
<li>Alcatraz, which plays a major strategical role in the 1996 Michael Bay film The Rock. Like this trailer, it involves a lot of military folks arguing. Sean Connery's also there.</li>
<li>Some rocks that stopped me reaching a city in time for it not to collapse into civil unrest in Civilization one time. Though my memory of that's hazy, I might just have deployed my response too late.</li>
</ul>
<p>In googling strategic war rocks, I've also uncovered <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/12/2/354/132286/Carbonate-rocks-and-American-Civil-War-infantry">this research article</a> about carbonate rocks and American Civil War infantry tactics, which could be very interesting or the driest thing I'll ever read.</p>
<p>Looping back to the video game, EA wrote in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/your-first-look-at-battlefield-6s-single-player-campaign/">PS blog</a> that during the campaign: "You’ll be able to command the rest of Dagger 13 to engage enemy forces as a group in order to suppress them as you reposition to snipe, flank them, or take out multiple foes with a well-thrown grenade. Additionally, as you step into the well-worn boots of different members of the squad, you’ll be able to take advantage of their respective abilities and talents to gain the upper hand when engaging the enemy." There's a rundown of all the squad members' names and bios in the post, if you fancy meeting them.</p>
<p>The battle royale testing is set to begin at some point this week, and you can sign-up to be given access <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs">here</a> if this'll be your first jaunt into Labs ahead of Battlefield 6's release on October 10th.</p>

<p>Ready for your Asterism Voyage?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dragami Games has announced that its mecha strategy title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> will launch for Switch 2 on <strong>25th September</strong>. By Jove, that's today!</p>
<p>Relayer Advanced, which sees you assume the role of Starchildren in a battle against the alien Relayer, has already seen release on various other platforms since its debut back in 2022, and this snazzy new Switch 2 version comes complete with all previously released DLC and spin-off story content.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, the 'Advanced' version is a souped-up take of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/relayer">Relayer</a> from March 2022 (the Advanced rejig launched the following October), which sits with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/relayer/">a Metascore of 77</a>. So, if you like SRPGs featuring big robots leathering chunks out of each other in space (and let's face it, who doesn't?), then it seems there's gonna be plenty of faces to get busy leathering for you.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the game's PR blurb, plus some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will command the "Stellar Gear" unit that the Starchildren board and battle against the "Relayer" forces. On stage, players will lead their troops to victory by making full use of such strategic systems as "Hate," which quantifies how easily enemies target you, "Skills" specific to jobs and characters, "Backstab," which launches pincer attacks, and "Big Bang," a special move.</p>
<p>This is the complete version that includes the main game as well as all previously released DLC.</p>
<p>Command a unit of "Stella Gear," humanoid weapons created using the technology of an ancient galactic civilization, and defend Earth from invasion by the mysterious lifeforms known as "Relayer."</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 100 cutscenes that are played when units battle each other.</p>
<p>The stage maps are also rendered in high-quality full 3D.</p>
<p>There is also "Hate," which indicates how likely you are to be targeted by the enemy, a wide variety of skills, and special attacks such as the pincer attack "Backstab" and the special move "Big Bang."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as all of the above tweaks, the game also includes a full English dub alongside its Japanese vocals. Hooray!</p>
<p>There's no pricing on Nintendo's US site just yet, but in the UK it'll set you back £29.50.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima/" data-ref-id="5000-693126">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> is the next chapter in the HoYoverse, and we've recently gotten more details about what the game is going to be about. The Honkai franchise has always been known for its anime-style graphics, quick and fluid combat, and addictive gameplay that keeps players coming back for more with every new installment. While Honkai: Nexus Anima is keeping many of those same elements, the developers are also changing up the core gameplay loop in some significant ways. Of course, you can still expect a similar feeling as the four previous games, but Nexus Anima is breathing some fresh ideas into the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't know everything about the new Honkai title, we've seen plenty of gameplay and heard enough details to get a good idea of what it has in store for the community. Below, you can see everything that we currently know about Honkai: Nexus Anima, including its release date, trailers, gameplay, and all other details in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Honkai: Nexus Anima be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, a release date for Honkai: Nexus Anima has not been announced by the developers at miHoYo. The game was only just recently formally announced on August 28, 2025, with some official screenshots, trailers, and information coming with that announcement.</p><p dir="ltr">However, no release date has been offered just yet. According to some rumors and how the development of the game is going, though, it seems like early 2026 is the most likely release window for Honkai: Nexus Anima at this time. Take that with a grain of salt, of course, as things can change drastically and we still don't know anything concrete.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Honkai: Nexus Anima</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the best parts about most new Honkai titles is that they are all free-to-play. The most recent game in the series, Honkai: Star Rail, was free-to-play at its launch in 2023, and that hasn't changed since.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, no preorders are necessary for Honkai: Nexus Anima, as you won't actually be able to purchase the game. This also means there are likely no editions for the game either. However, the developers haven't officially confirmed the free-to-play nature of the game, so Nexus Anima having a price tag attached to it can't be ruled out just yet. It would be a major change for the franchise if the game wasn't free-to-play, though.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Honkai: Nexus Anima Trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, there are two Honkai: Nexus Anima trailers you can watch that both come directly from the developer. One is a trailer for the private gameplay test that began in September, and the other is a gameplay trailer that showcases some of the new elements in Nexus Anima. You can watch both of them below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FV_6jirKU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5FV_6jirKU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first trailer, titled "Nexus Bond Teaser: Side by Side," is more of a cinematic trailer than anything. It features some of the characters and Anima that you'll see throughout the game. However, it mainly showcases the world that you'll get to explore, and the graphics are certainly a major highlight.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the second trailer, titled "In-game footage from Honkai: Nexus Anima," this is where we get into actual gameplay. The trailer shows off some of the gameplay mechanics that are being introduced with the game, as well as more characters and Anima. There's a look at the flying mechanic, a full-length battle, character creation, and a broader view of the world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Both of these trailers were released when Nexus Anima was announced in late August, and it's not currently known when a new trailer could arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As of right now, we know for sure that Honkai: Nexus Anima will be releasing on PC, iOS, and Android devices. This is the same trend that recent Honkai games have followed, but Honkai: Star Rail also eventually came to PlayStation 5. This occurred roughly six months following the game's initial release date.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if the developers have a console release date in mind for Nexus Anima. If the developers are planning a PS5 or Xbox version, though, we'll likely hear about it closer to the game's actual release date. Even then, we can assume that a console port wouldn't arrive until after the game launches on its standard platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Not too much about the story of Honkai: Nexus Anima has been revealed just yet. However, we do know the game takes place in a seaside town with dense urban elements. You can travel through the metropolis or take a stroll with your Anima down one of the several beach boulevards. The map in Nexus Anima seems to be quite large, so there's no shortage of places to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll also meet a variety of characters throughout the world, and many of them can be interacted with by you or your Anima. The main characters in Nexus Anima don't have too many details around them just yet, as the developers are likely waiting to reveal more of the main story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At its core, Honkai: Nexus Anima is a "creature-collector" game, which is akin to something like Pokémon. Players can head out into a large, open world and collect different creatures that will then be added to their party. These creatures are called "Anima."</p><p dir="ltr">While you can battle with these Anima and face off against other NPCs, your Anima aren't solely meant for that purpose. They also have utility during exploration and other areas, making your priorities for capturing one different from what they might be in a game like Pokémon. For example, some Anima are efficient at cleaning up the streets of the city by picking up trash, while others can actually work in stores and interact with potential customers. You can also level up your Anima, who all start at level 10, through a star-based system. Anima are leveled up through experience in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to battling, though, Anima have unique combat roles. These are defined by the Anima's in-game "Trait," which tells you more about how they will battle. One example of a Trait is the Gladiator, which likely means an Anima is going to be more fierce in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">To further help out Anima and customize them, each one has three gear slots that can be filled with gear you find out in the open world. Some gear will be more tailored to certain types of Anima, so it might be crucial to seek out that specific gear if you want to use one Anima in particular.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of using Anima, you don't have a traditional party of these creatures like in other games of this nature. Instead, Honkai: Nexus Anima uses a deck-building system that allows you to customize a deck of your acquired Anima. When you head into battle, you'll roll out the deck you've assembled based on real-time elements. Your deck won't be randomly rolled, so you can pick and choose which Anima appear in a battle depending on external factors.</p><p dir="ltr">Battling follows an auto-chess system, but there are several other elements that come into play as well. When a battle begins, you'll send out your Anima, and an "Animaster" will provide a buff to your creatures as combat starts. You can also utilize the assistance slots on the battlefield, which can be used by both teams and offer support in the form of healing, extra damage, etc.</p>

            <p>Sega has revealed the post-launch roadmap for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, including last night's announcement that Mega Man will be joining next year as paid DLC.</p>
<p>Capcom's iconic hero will be joined by Proto Man too, plus there will be a Dr. Wily's Castle course and a vehicle inspired by canine companion Rush.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available in Q2 next year in the third patch of the game's Season Pass. That begins later this year with the addition of Minecraft and SpongeBob Squarepants, with Pac-Man to follow early next year.</p>

<p>Then, Q3 of 2026 will see the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> and anime Avatar Legends. Each Season Pass Content Pack includes playable characters, a new vehicle, a new track, emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a number of free updates adding new characters and more. Hatsune Miku and Sonic Prime characters are available at launch for Digital Deluxe owners. Then later this year Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from Like A Dragon will be added, along with another unknown character.</p>
<p>More free additions will arrive in each quarter next year. You can see the roadmap in the image below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">Mega Man's inclusion leaked last week</a>, so his reveal at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a> came as little surprise.</p>
<p>However, the back of the physical box includes artwork for Sega Saturn icon NiGHTS, with fans presuming the jester character will be one of the free characters coming to the game.</p>
<p>Who else do you hope to see join Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds?</p>

            <p>The next grand open-world setting for the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> game will be Japan, Microsoft has accidentally announced, and it will be released in 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement came via an Instagram post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/forzahorizonofficial/">the official Forza Horizon account</a>. This let slip, ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-live-watch-it-with-us">Tokyo Game Show 2025 Xbox briefing</a> today, that "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan. Coming 2026." The post has since been removed. Whoops!</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Playground Games / Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The full announcement is expected to occur in the Xbox briefing that's only moments away - due to begin at 11am UK time. How much of the game we'll see, we don't yet know, nor how much of Japan it will allow us to explore.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was released four years ago now, in 2021, and this year debuted on PlayStation 5, in the spring. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNHhTNEVIUmNRc1d6dFJ3ZgEeNeEeu8Qu5tD-zcBwnMvjnEelfLbKhqomunPmhYChqepr7UZmU8nQvQuCyqw_aem_FMSnw25d-mSOyt9PPW3ayQ">Tom thinks it's one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>. Given that, the question of whether this new instalment could launch on PlayStation 5 is probably more "when?" rather than "if?". Or, "How long will Microsoft keep it exclusive to Xbox for?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft has now officially announced Forza Horizon 6, confirming their own leak with the exact same teaser video.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwlw0ChiSR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is a collaboration between Playground Studios and Turn10, but details are still being kept under wraps with more to show next year. However, the teams did share a few tidbits on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the game will once again feature a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but they’ve also brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism”. Seasons will also make a return, to have as great an impact as they did for Forza Horizon 4’s British seasons, and they’ll naturally be trying to embrace the local car culture of Japan.</p>
<p><em>The original story follows:</em></p>

<p>Just ahead of the Xbox Tokyo Game Show event at 11AM UK time, Forza Horizon 6 has leaked, confirming that &nbsp;the next entry in the open world racer is heading to Japan, when it launches in 2026.</p>

<p>The teaser shows a number of license plates from the locations that the series has visited in the past, before panning past some Japanese memorabilia and up to reveal Mount Fuji off in the distance.</p>
<p>The leak came from Forza’s own social media accounts, posting the teaser to Instagram almost 12 hours ago, and it’s seemingly appearing as an advert across social streams. With the cat out of the bag – the neko, if you will – it seems they’ve just left it all live.</p>
<p>No word on platform specifics just yet, but the game is definitely coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC at launch, with Xbox Play Anywhere and availability on Game Pass. Whether it’s day and date for PS5 as well, we won’t have to wait too long to find out, I suspect.</p>

<p>What's more, the studios have revealed the new Titanic Scion update roadmap, so we can get an idea of everything on the horizon.

<p>We had a decent enough time with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion's mech combat when it launched on Switch 2, but felt that the whole thing was sullied by a less than perfect performance. Here's hoping that this update moves things in the right direction.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards are far from being the most popular game format among users, but they are proving to be way more popular among developers, as they allow them to overcome some of the limitations of traditional cartridges, according to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>Speaking with German publication <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JP Games</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged why users don't like them, but from a developer's perspective, the discussion on Game-Key cards is much different. This new format allows developers to overcome storage restrictions, as releasing on a Game-Key card allows the developer to overcome the Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges 64 GB limitation.</p>



<p>The biggest issue for developers, especially those making high-end AAA games, is the loading speed of traditional cartridges, which is slower than the speed of solid-state drives. By releasing games on Nintendo Switch 2 in this <em>"semi-download"</em> format, developers can leverage the faster loading speed of the console's internal storage, allowing them to release their AAA games on the system.</p>



<p>While acknowledging how users may not like Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director hopes that, in time, they will come to like them and accept them as part of the culture of gaming on the system. Not only is using them optional for a developer, but it also allows studios to release high-end experiences that may not have hit the system without them.</p>



<p>Since their reveal alongside the system this April, the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards have been somewhat controversial, especially among those who like actual physical releases. While some developers worked their magic and managed to release their huge AAA games on a regular cartridge, like&nbsp;CD Projekt Red did with Cyberpunk 2077, others made it clear, like Naoki Hamaguchi, that traditional carts have limitations that<span> force them to release their games on Game-Key cards, like in the Star Wars Outlaws case. The open-world game launched on a Game-Key card</span> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target the developer was going for.</a></p>

            <p>Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal whipped out their dark shades and finest tactical trench coat at last night's State of Play, announcing that a remaster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> is set to sneak into our lives early next year. It's a "modernized" version of the classic stealthy and shooty sci-fi sojourn.</p>

<p>The remaster is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3131640/Deus_Ex_Remastered/">set to hit PC on February 5th, 2026</a>. As you can see in the trailer above and as explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/">PS blog</a>, it gives the original game a visual facelift that smooths out some of its old school blockiness, with revamped character models that boast "smoother lip-sync animations and ragdoll physics". Elsewhere in visuals department, Aspyr and Eidos have touched up the various environs JC Denton sneaks or shoots through with "reimagined lighting, dynamic shadows, water physics, particle effects, and fully updated textures".</p>
<p>They've also worked in some quality-of-life additions like autosaves, zippier loading times, achievement tracking, and cloud saves "across supported platforms". Rounding things out is revamped support for controllers which "draws inspiration from what Eidos-Montréal pioneered in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and Mankind Divided" with "refined radial menus, fluid weapon management, and streamlined navigation". Plus, setups with ultrawide or multiple monitors will work out of the gate.</p><p>So, a very remastery remaster. The question is whether it'll be as tempting a purchase for PC folks as I imagine it'll be on console. As of writing, the original Deus Ex's game of the year edition can be grabbed for less than £1/€1/$1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/">Steam</a> thanks to a deal running until September 29th. Over on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">GOG.com</a>, it's currently £5.99, but is also part of the platform's preservation program, meaning GOG themselves have made sure it runs as it should on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex_revision_mod">platforms</a> host the Deus Ex Revision mod which offers a substantial fan-made revamp of the game, and it's tough to say whether the £22.49/€26.09/$26.99 that's been stapled to the remaster right now - set to go up to £24.99 and equivalents once it's out - will be that appealing to folks keen for an Extra dose of Deus.</p>
<p>Time will tell if going the full remake route might've been a better call on Aspyr's part, at least from a PC-centric perspective.</p>
