			<p>It's been a while since we heard any news about Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra. The action/adventure game in development at Skydance New Media and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to be published by Plaion</a> should launch this year, but there have been no further details on the release timing, and some fans have been worried about a delay.</p>
<p>According to Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton, though, the team is still doing its best to release it this Holiday season. <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to The Direct</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited. To be playing him in the video game, playing his grandfather, be playing a version of Black Panther, and looking on there and seeing that it's me… It's like the most photo realistic… We want people to play this game and have the entire family, sit on the sofa and watch it like they're watching 'Game of Thrones,' or 'The Walking Dead,' or something. We’re looking for just an incredible cinematic experience for everybody, and I pinch myself.</em></p>
<p>Payton is definitely right about the game's photorealism. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals during Epic's Unreal Engine GDC 2024 live stream.</p>
<p>The development team is helmed by none other than Amy Hennig, who's renowned in the industry for her work on Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver, Uncharted, and Battlefield: Hardline. She was famously developing the Star Wars game codenamed Project Ragtag at Visceral Games before the studio was shut down and the project canceled.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in September 2022, Marvel 1943: Rise of the Hydra is set in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II. It involves Steve Rogers (Captain America) forming an uneasy alliance with Azzuri (Black Panther), the king of Wakanda. Other playable characters include Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones and Nanali, leader of the Wakandan Spy Network.</p>

The remarkable Hulu series is set in a world where rich and powerful people designed a utopian city called Paradise inside of a Colorado mountain in order to survive an extinction-level event that has ravaged Earth. The illusion of safety is shattered when President of the United States Cal Bradford (James Marsden) is mysteriously murdered in a place where crime isn’t supposed to exist, and it’s up to his Secret Service bodyguard Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) to find out who did it. Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon (Julianne Nicholson), the brains behind the entire Paradise project, turns out to be a worthy adversary who’s trying to do the right thing in the absolute worst possible ways.</p><p><em>Paradise</em> does a lot of things well, but its shining achievement is showing how much of a badass Sterling K. Brown can be.</p><p>Known for his portrayals of stern but loving parents on his breakout show <em>This Is Us</em> and in the severely underrated film <em>Waves</em>, the Emmy-winning actor finds himself in some of the most intense situations of his illustrious career thanks to the Hulu series. Without shooting that many bullets or killing that many people, Brown channels the same emotional control that made his earlier characters feel three-dimensional to perform a role at the intersection of grief and anger. He isn’t a badass just for the sake of being one. He’s a badass because it’s the right thing to do. And these are his most badass moments from the first season of <em>Paradise</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Ser Baffo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-recommend-id="image://3a6d0f17ae4ec6447a44be6180ce5f94" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1687" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a testament to how wildly the show’s character dynamics shifted by the end of the season, Agent Collins risking his life to protect the president from an assassin’s bullet in the first episode isn’t even a Top 5 most badass moment by the end of the season. While speaking to the press, Collins shields the president from a crazed boom operator who slides a gun out of his boom mic in an inventive but unsuccessful assassination attempt. In the moment, it was incredible watching Collins’ super-secret agent senses slow down time, allowing him to effectively react to the shot before it happens, and seeing him so focused on doing his job that he doesn’t realize he’s been shot until the President tells him. Unfortunately, revelations from later in the season  knock this badass moment down a few pegs, and it also suffers from not being presented from the boom operator’s perspective, which would have placed it squarely in the top 3.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-recommend-id="image://1fbd8ec6ee6251e4be54a7b25d134347" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown standing guard" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There was no sequence in <em>Paradise</em>, or arguably any other show so far this year, as nerve wracking and suffocatingly intense as the one in which everyone in the White House realizes the severity of the natural disaster they’ve been watching take out entire countries. The seventh episode is centered on the chaotic day when the president let’s everyone in America, including the shell-shocked politicians outside the Oval Office, know that he and a few others knew about the cataclysm they’ve been watching, essentially telling them that death is inevitable for most of them. A true badass can oscillate between emotions at the drop of a dime, and Brown exhibited some of his most emotionally visceral acting yet as he was frantically worrying about the safety of his wife in Atlanta while also being tasked with getting the president through the mob of his hostile colleagues ready to tear him apart for keeping them in the dark. </p><p> He runs back to grab the briefcase the president needs to launch a nuclear attack seconds after the last person holding it was shot in the back of the head, then scurries to the helicopter without a single blink, tear, or even dust from the propeller entering his eyes. That’s a stone cold badass who unfortunately did it in service of a plot he’d quickly learn may have cost him the love of his life. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-recommend-id="image://9720a6479c1934250612aa7a2110774f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James Marsden (left) explaining something to Sterling K Brown (right)" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Verbally reprimanding your boss in front of his subordinates could get you fired from McDonald’s. Doing that to the President of the United States, and as a result delaying his evacuation from an extinction-level disaster, could (and probably should) get you shot before your lips formed an exclamation point. None of that matters to tearfully enraged Agent Collins after he finally realizes the President knew Collins’ wife was doomed from the beginning of the day. As he and the leader of the free world exchange barbs over the reality of the situation, Collins looks him dead in his dreamy blue eyes and mocks the president’s performative bravery for telling the American people the world was already ending before they had a chance to prepare like he did. He then makes the impossible choice to accept his wife’s death in order to be there for his children, etching this in the Sterling K. Brown badass hall of fame.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-recommend-id="image://03c8696cf74c033b884d8ac6c1b68fd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sterling K Brown holding a gun to Sinatra's head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, Samantha “Sinatra” Redmon was a grieving mother who turned the grief of her son’s death into her life’s purpose to protect the ones she loved from a dying world, but she’s deserved a bullet in the head since the second episode. That quick shift from distraught to dangerous that I mentioned earlier was at its peak in the 10 seconds Collins went from a puddle of tears to a gun-toting killer after Sinatra implied that she’d accidentally had his daughter killed. This would’ve been a little higher on the list if he put the megalomaniac out of her misery. Unfortunately all he did was distract her long enough with a gun to her head for Sinatra’s own assassin, Jane Driscoll (Nicole Brydon Bloom), to put a bullet in her chest to disable her without killing her. I guess you shouldn’t come between a psycho and their Nintendo Wii.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hulu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-recommend-id="image://8c2e887f44b4035a678801db1fc989b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1650" data-height="825" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eerie message in the sky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are certain things in life that are inherently badass simply because describing them sounds unbelievable. Once Collins was ready to finally come at Sinatra, he called in the craziest favor you can ever ask a neighbor: Leave digital messages in the sky for all to see. In episode six, Collins had the messages “THEY’RE LYING TO YOU,” “DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?” and “WHO IS SINATRA?” displayed across the sky in crimson red. That alone was a badass move to destabilize Sinatra’s influence over the community. It became genius when the only way she could have it removed was by rebooting the sky. REBOOTING. THE. SKY.

In the middle of his silent uprising in the sixth episode, Collins cuts through Dr. Gabriela Torabi (Sarah Shahi) trying to talk him out of his dissention with her psychobabble bullshit by vividly comparing Sinatra bringing all of these people to this idyllic city inside a mountain to the way people corral cows  into increasingly smaller spaces until the fight in them is diminished so much that they  “line up single-file and march down a chute to their death.” His delivery is bone-chilling, the analogy is sobering, and the interspersed visuals of Agent Robinson (Krys Marshall) finding Sinatra’s hidden armory during his speech are devastating. Speaking the truth is usually the most badass thing you can do, especially when it’s a matter of life or death.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedell</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-recommend-id="image://20f0901f5e8409a45215700e75c784bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nicole Robinson (left) and Xavier Collins (right) taking out weapons" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The #4 pick and #2 pick have some overlap, but they’re not quite the same. With the help of Agent Robinson and a bunch of disillusioned Secret Service colleagues, Collins organizes a multifaceted coup of the powers that be. He and his cohorts surreptitiously steal all of the guns the government said didn’t exist, and hack the sky to tell the people being governed that they’ve been lied to, leading Sinatra to initiate the shelter protocol that had all senior officials and their families corralled in a secure location like the cattle he mentioned earlier. While his ultimate plan of imprisoning Sinatra with the rest of the corrupt officials doesn’t succeed, bringing a government to its knees is A-1 badassery. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney/Brian Roedel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ee4c8f8da3d70685320cef0da2470" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="2000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Xavier Collins looking at coordinates" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Guns, blood, and government destabilization require bravery, but nothing is more badass than flying a plane out of a mountain into potentially poisonous air to find your wife who may or may not be alive. After 8 episodes of Collins doing everything from organizing a coup to berating the President of the United States after taking a bullet for him,  Collins commandeered a plane and took off to find his wife based on the secret coordinates the late president left. Season 2 will undoubtedly have him venturing into the unknown while his kids and everyone else he cares for back at Paradise deal with the aftermath of his uprising. No matter where he is, you can count on Collins to be the biggest badass in the vicinity. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-%E2%80%9Ceffectively-closed%E2%80%9D.1126164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Until Dawn Remake developer Ballistic Moon is “effectively closed”. That’s according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that after the layoffs that were publicly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in September 2024</a> took place, roughly 40 employees or so were let go. The remaining staff was kept to offer post-launch support and development on Until Dawn after its October release. In December 2024, however, the company quietly laid off that staff as well, resulting in around 20 more developers losing their job.</p>



<p>Sources say that only the studios’ founders remain and “possibly” a handful of employees “at most”. There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left.</p>



<p>“People are sharing bugs they’ve found in the game to make the team aware but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore,” one source said. “The studio has effectively closed now.”</p>



<p>As far as what happened, those who spoke on the condition of anonymity made it clear that the owners attempted to keep things at Ballistic Moon moving forward. Many said that the owners were actively looking for funding and pitching projects, but couldn’t secure funding or a new publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about Sony publishing another game or future updates to Until Dawn Remake for the studio, one source said it was discussed but never came to fruition.</p>



<p>“Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but looks like they didn’t,” the source said.</p>



<p>Regarding working at the studio, most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work. Many spoke highly of their teams and the work being done. What they didn’t like, though, were instances of unpaid overtime. One former employee equated it to “weeks” of unpaid work and that the internal announcement of redundancies came after the team had worked overtime.</p>



<p>“Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>



<p>Ballistic Moon’s leadership has yet to put out an official statement on the status of the studio and whether or not it has been or will be closed. In technical terms, it’s remains active in name. Should a publisher sign on or funding come from elsewhere, the studio could start the hiring process again to bring in developers and other staff. Right now, however, there is no work being done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted multiple times to get in contact with Ballistic Moon’s co-founders and owners as well as Sony regarding the claims of additional funding for the studio, but no responses have been received. Should any come after the publishing of this story, it will be added in an update.</p>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Minecraft: Spicewood is seemingly the sequel to Minecraft Dungeons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leak arrives from X0X_LEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1897050276374425705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, who has stated that the upcoming Minecraft Dungeons sequel is being referred to internally as “Project Spicewood” and has “been in development for at least 2 years.” The post also reveals more details about the upcoming spinoff title, including the main areas and POIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to X0X_LEAK, Minecraft has a set of new areas and POIs for the Dungeons sequel; we now know the 3 locations and their places of interest. First up is Honeycomb Fields, which features locations such as Undermill, Farm, Island, Lake, Fields, and Forest. Next is the Desert, which includes a Cliff, Fortress, Mountain, Village and Icelagoon. Last up is Forest, which will introduce a Deep Dark entrance, an Outpost Entrance, a Witchzone, and a Shady Forest Town.&nbsp;</p>

The first image could be the official artwork for “Project Spicewood,” and the second image is a gameplay screenshot for the upcoming title, featuring a perspective similar to that of the 2020 dungeon crawler.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2 developer Colossal Order has shared an update on the city builder sequel's long-delayed console release - confirming it still has "more things we need to address" before it can launch, and that it won't be arriving before summer.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions were originally due to launch alongside the PC release back in October 2023, but Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">announced a last-minute delay</a> into 2024. Its release was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">delayed indefinitely</a> following Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch on PC - which continues to attract <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">complaints about poor performance and simulation issues</a>, despite multiple updates over the 18 months since then.
</p>
<p>
Colossal Order's most recent news on Cities: Skylines 2 console release came last November, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-studio-blames-ongoing-console-delay-on-hardware-limitations">admitted it was struggling to overcome "hardware limitations"</a> impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. It noted it had managed to get the game "stable and playable" on consoles by "significantly lowering the graphics quality", but said it wasn't happy with the compromise and wanted to bring graphics quality up to an "acceptable level".

<p>
Skip ahead six months and Colossal Order has addressed Cities: Skylines 2's console release once more, and while progress is apparently being made, it sounds like there's still some way to go. "We continue to make steady progress on the console version," it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english">wrote in an update</a>, "and our core focus has been on further improving performance and stability. However, despite these advancements, we have more things we need to address before we reach the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players."
</p>
<p>
"We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release," it continued, "but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer. We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we're closer to a launch-ready state. Our goal remains unchanged: to bring Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the best possible shape."
</p>
<p>
News isn't entirely positive on the PC front, either. Colossal Order has also admitted it's struggling with Cities: Skylines 2's custom asset editor - a modding feature it called "crucial" last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced it was delaying its DLC plans</a> in order to get the asset editor finished and released. But in its latest update, the studio has said the feature is proving "more technically challenging than initially anticipated due to the hefty amounts of built-in assets affected by the changes, but it is moving forward."
</p>
<p>
"Rest assured that we're committed to solving these challenges," it wrote, "and our dedicated team is actively making progress to overcome them. We know how much custom assets mean to you and, honestly, to us, too, and we will continue to keep you informed of our progress as soon as we have something more concrete to share."
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm," the studio concluded, "and we will share more updates as we continue shaping the future of Cities: Skylines together." It added it'll be back next week when the original Cities: Skylines celebrates its 10th anniversary.

Here are all the nominees along with iyr predictions.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="6">Best Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>


<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7">Prediction: A strong category, but it has to be Astro Bot, the plucky PlayStation mascot who has charmed the whole planet.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="9">Animation</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10">Prediction: Harder to call this one but it’s probably going to be Astro Bot again, if only for the huge amount of incidental animations that you can trigger.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="11">Artistic Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Harold Halibut</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Neva</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12">Prediction: Harold Halibut’s stop motion animation seems to be the perfect winner for this category, it took eleven years to complete so that must deserve an award.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="13">Audio Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>

•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">Prediction: Hellblade 2’s binaural recording and mixing is going to win this, no question.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="16">British Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">•&nbsp;<em>A Highland Song</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Paper Trail</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">Prediction: There are some <em>very</em> British games in this category but the slapstick Yorkshire humour of Thank Goodness You’re Here! is probably going to win.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="18">Debut Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19">Prediction: Another strong category but you can’t ignore the behemoth that is Balatro.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="21">Evolving Game</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22">•&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 14</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22">Prediction: This one could go anywhere, but Sea of Thieves, Final Fantast 14 and No Man’s Sky have won this category before, so maybe Diablo 4.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="23">Family</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Cat Quest 3</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Plucky Squire</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17">Prediction: Astro Bot. 100%.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="25">Game Beyond Entertainment</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26">•&nbsp;<em>Botany Manor</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Kind Words 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26">Prediction: Another hard one to guess but Bafta do go for some odd choices now and then and if Hellblade 2 is getting wins elsewhere it might be Vampire Therapist.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="28">Game Design</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14">Prediction: While none of these games bring anything particularly new to the table they all play exceptionally well. Lets go with Astro Bot again.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="30">Multiplayer</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31">•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31">Prediction: Well it won’t be Lego Horizon Adventures, it’s fun but no. I have a feeling this will either go to Warhammer or Helldivers, so I am going with Helldivers 2.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="33">Music</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34">Prediction: A completely open field here, it really depends on what sort of music you like really.&nbsp; It would be nice to see Black Myth: Wukong win something,</p>
<h2 data-node-id="35">Narrative</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36">•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36">Prediction: I am going for Still Wakes The Deep, it’s a British game which gives it the edge.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="37">New Intellectual Property</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38">•&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38">Prediction: This is a bit of a weird category as Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You’re Here! really don’t need to sequels, and Balatro is a card game and-&nbsp; no offence to creators – they didn’t invent the standard card deck or the Poker hands it uses. Black Myth: Wukong is s retelling of Journey To The West, so we think this will go to Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>

<h2 data-node-id="40">Performer in a Leading Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41">• Alec Newman,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Humberly González,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em><br>
• Isabella Inchbald,&nbsp;<em>Indika</em><br>
• Luke Roberts,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em><br>
• Melina Juergens,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Y’lan Noel,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41">Prediction: Almost certainly a second BAFTA for Melina Juergens.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="42">Performer in a Supporting Role</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43">• Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Aldís Amah Hamilton,&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
• Jon Blyth,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Karen Dunbar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em><br>
• Matt Berry,&nbsp;<em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em><br>
• Michael Abubakar,&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43">Prediction: Could be anyone but let us hope it’s Matt Berry just for the acceptance speech.</p>
<h2 data-node-id="45">Technical Achievement</h2>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">•&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Tiny Glade</em><br>
•&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></p>
<p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46">Prediction: Given that Ninja Theory went to a lot of trouble to tell everyone they had travelled to Iceland to scan every rock and blade of grass, it’s going to be Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sucker Punch has been tight-lipped about Ghost of Yotei so far, but we’re keeping an eye on the Ghost of Tsushima 2 sequel. The stealthy standalone follow-up has a few details out in the public already, and it’s looking promising.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> was a fun surprise announcement during the Sept. 24, 2024, Sony State of Play. Ghost of Tsushima cemented Sucker Punch as a stalwart of a studio following years of success with Sly Cooper and inFamous. Now, it’s back with Ghost of Yotei, and a certain Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is making Ghost of Yotei more intriguing by the day.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the latest Ghost of Yotei reveals and announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Ghost of Yotei is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect Ghost of Yotei to be just as impactful. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei doesn’t have a release date yet, but its initial reveal trailer claimed a 2025 release is on the cards for the open-world game.</strong></p>



<p>The first trailer was stunning, it was captivating, and it shockingly had a release period. After nearly three minutes of eye-opening action and drama, Ghost of Yotei’s Announce Trailer had a simple message: “2025.”</p>



<p>As of writing, we’ve not heard too much about Ghost of Yotei since. The calendar year is stacked with new games, but Sony’s catalog of hardware-selling goliaths is probably a bit more barren than most would have thought. A delay or a development hiccup could scupper Ghost of Yotei’s 2025 release date, and we’ll update this guide if this is the case.</p>



<p>Also, I’d wager Sucker Punch wants breathing space between Ghost of Yotei and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. There are a lot of similarities between both titles, so waiting until Shadows releases is the prudent play.</p>



<p>You can check out the full announcement trailer below—thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation YouTube account</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-ghost-of-yotei-platforms">All Ghost of Yotei Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei is currently only scheduled to release on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a PlayStation 4 port scheduled—which makes sense given the supposed scale of the title—but an eyebrow or two might be raised at a lack of a PC launch. Ghost of Tsushima eventually released on PC a few years after its initial debut.</p>



<p>With Sony’s continued philosophy to bring its exclusives to PC after a while, it’s likely Ghost of Yotei will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor and release on PC later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>More Ghost of Yotei information is sure to drop as 2025 progresses. Could the Ghost of Tsushima successor end up being PlayStation’s star attraction this year? Or does Sony need to deliver more exclusive news? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-jersey-betting-bill-could-permit-esports-players-to-wager-on-themselves.1126110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been discovered that a newly proposed bill in the state of New Jersey could allow esports competitors to <strong>wager on themselves and their teams</strong> if successfully implemented. This bill would be integrated alongside new ‘esports-specific skins’ that would permit licensees to offer odds on esports betting markets in the state.</p>



<p>This news comes almost six years after the state’s first legal esports wager was placed at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. In 2021, the state opened its doors to esports betting as part of the legal sports betting portfolio in the region, but things are still developing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-half-the-industry">Half the Industry</h2>



<p>In the most recent edition <a href="https://sharpr.substack.com/p/stake-strikes-viral-gold-with-drake?open=false#%C2%A7nj-bill-will-introduce-esports-specific-skins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the Sharpr newsletter</a>, it was revealed that New Jersey lawmakers are working on a unique bill that would introduce something quite bizarre. If successfully passed, esports competitors (of legal betting age) could bet on (or against…) themselves or their teams.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how that <strong>couldn’t </strong>go wrong – it’s a recipe for disaster, surely.</p>



<p>In the report from Sharpr, it was claimed that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement will have the power to authorise venues holding esports events to accept exclusive wagers on the <strong>outcome </strong>of said events.</p>



<p>The primary sponsor of the bill, William Moen, explained that this is a step to ‘capitalise on an emerging industry.’</p>



<p>It’s a relatively well-known fact that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s overall revenue – a substantial sum. Behind esports betting sits merchandising, ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcast rights, but the esports industry is still not entirely profitable.</p>



<p>Last September, at ESI Lisbon, an expert panel featuring representatives from GRID, Kambi Abios, and BETER expressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/">billions are being made in wagers</a> and that the esports betting market is no longer ’emerging’, as Moen puts it.</p>



<p>This latest bill proposed in New Jersey seems like a wrong turn, but the state has been at the forefront of esports betting for a while, so there must be some method to the madness.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s not the first time something like this has existed. In the past, some sites have offered players the ability to place wagers on themselves in certain games, charging them with completing challenges to receive a payout. That’s entirely different to betting on yourself as a pro esports player in a competitive environment, though.</p>



<p>Have you ever placed a bet on an esports match? Let us know in the comments what the outcome was.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Launched in 2017, Xbox Game Pass is something of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/">paradigm shift</a> in the world of video games. For a monthly fee, members get access to a collection of games--including new releases from Microsoft--and as long as they stay subscribed, they can play those games as much as they want. That is, unless a title leaves the Game Pass catalog--and that's a regular occurrence, especially for titles from third-party companies. Whereas Microsoft's own games rarely get removed from Game Pass, third-party games regularly rotate out of the catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">But why does Game Pass lose games? After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-9-games-are-leaving-game-pass-very-soon/2900-6267/">17 games were removed from the Game Pass library in February 2025</a>, some might be wondering why.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>No set reason</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There is no one set reason, and when Microsoft announces games that are joining Game Pass, it never says how long they'll stick around for. But the most common explanation is the same rationale for titles leaving Netflix or any other subscription service: a developer/publisher signed a contract with Microsoft for a set period of time, like one year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-removing-these-seven-games-very-soon/2900-5931/#1">which was the case for Persona 5 Tactica</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stressed that the company makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">all kinds of different deals to get companies to bring their games to Game Pass</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason a game might be removed from Game Pass is due to licensing. Many games feature licensed music or other forms of licensed content. Those licenses have terms, and to adhere to them, sometimes a game gets removed or updated. The Xbox-exclusive game Quantum Break was removed from Game Pass temporarily due to licenses that needed to be renewed, some may recall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-temporarily-removed-from-xbox-game-pass-but-its-coming-back/1100-6512949/">but it eventually came back.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Games may also be removed from the Game Pass library for other reasons, like a business choice to delist an older game in a given series. Microsoft's own Forza Horizon 4, for example, was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="nofollow ">delisted in 2024 and thus also removed from the Game Pass library</a>. Everyone who already had the game via Game Pass before the delisting received a code to download the full game to keep playing. But anyone who wanted to jump into the game for the first time via Game Pass is out of luck. Why would Microsoft do this? For Forza Horizon 4, Microsoft said it <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ" rel="nofollow ">came down to</a> "agreements with licensing and other partnerships ending." That's as specific as Microsoft got. It's a disappointing situation, for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892" data-ratio="0.58244365361803" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892"></a><figcaption>Game Pass is a major differentiator for Microsoft in the console market.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to business choices and licensing or contract situations, sometimes annualized sports games get replaced by a newer entry in a given series. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/">For example, Madden NFL 23 left Game Pass in February 2025, but EA added Madden NFL 25</a>--the newest game in the series--just before the Super Bowl this year. For what it's worth, Madden NFL 24 is also still available on Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Multiple tiers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In addition to getting more expensive, Game Pass has become more convoluted in recent years with the addition of multiple tiers of the service. The original promise of Game Pass was that signing up for the service gave members access to all of Microsoft's first-party games at launch, plus a growing catalog of titles from other companies. That is no longer true.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, people have to subscribe to the most expensive tier of Game Pass on console, Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month), to get day-one titles and the biggest library of games, plus streaming support and access to the EA Play catalog. PC Game Pass offers similar benefits for $12/month. The Game Pass Standard membership ($15/month) on console comes with hundreds of games, but no day-one new releases; Game Pass Core ($10/month) includes a library of 25+ titles but no day-one launches.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Pass Standard and Core libraries are steadier than Game Pass Ultimate, but they, too, have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/">titles that get removed every once in a while</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A silver lining</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're playing and enjoying a game in the Game Pass library and suddenly it gets removed, that may be annoying or frustrating. But there is a small silver lining: All Game Pass members can save 20% on digital content, including full games, so players can buy a game outright to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">A game also doesn't normally get removed from Game Pass without warning. Microsoft publishes the lists of games set for removal to its blog twice per month, with removals normally occurring in the middle of the month and at the end, giving you about two weeks to finish up. Game Pass members can also navigate to the "leaving soon" tab on Game Pass to find out what's leaving soon. That's only so helpful if you're in the middle of an RPG that's dozens of hours long, though.</p><p dir="ltr">And of course, more games are added to Game Pass each month. Having something new to play is part of the appeal of Game Pass, and the service definitely delivers in that respect.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deals with developers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Spencer told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> that Microsoft makes Game Pass deals "based on the developer's need." One example, he said, is that a developer might agree to launch a new game into Game Pass in exchange for a specific dollar amount payment. In other cases, Microsoft might fund the entire production of a game in exchange for an agreement to have the game launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. Another possibility is just a simple money deal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes the developer's more done with the game and it's more just a transaction of, 'Hey, we'll put it in Game Pass if you'll pay us this amount of money,'" Spencer said. Still other potential arrangements include payments based on usage or spend, Spencer said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft echoed Spencer's comments, telling GameSpot that because every game is unique, the company works closely with developers to structure a "custom program" that factors in what a given developer/publisher needs, while ensuring they are "compensated financially for their participation in the service."</p><p>"While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving," Microsoft said.</p><p>Indeed, that's set to happen again soon, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-six-more-games-very-soon/2900-6296/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6296">Enter the Gungeon returns to Game Pass on March 11</a>. The Devolver Digital-published game originally left Game Pass in 2022. Devolver was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836"> among the first high-profile critics of Game Pass.</a></p><p>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V is arguably the biggest Game Pass title ever, and it's bounced in and out of the service over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-whats-leaving-game-pass-soon-including-gta-5-again/1100-6520096/" data-ref-id="1100-6520096">most recently leaving for a second time in January 2024.</a> Rockstar parent company Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">launching a new game into Game Pass makes no financial sense</a>, but it can be a reasonable business possibility for older titles, like GTA 5.</p><p>Here is Microsoft's full statement regarding why Game Pass titles may exit the catalog:</p><p>"Each game is unique, so we work closely with creators to build a custom program to reflect what they need, ensure they are compensated financially for their participation in the service, and allow room for creativity and innovation. While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>You don't own anything anyway</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The term "ownership" takes on new meaning in a digital context. If you buy a digital game outright or subscribe to Game Pass, you're not taking ownership of anything in the traditional sense. You are, instead, essentially renting access to games. It seems unlikely, but Microsoft could stop offering Game Pass tomorrow, as an example.</p><p dir="ltr">The state of California is making things official with its new law, AB2426, which mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than actual ownership. The juggernaut PC platform Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-makes-it-clearer-what-youre-really-buying/1100-6527127/">updated its storefront in 2024</a> to inform people that "a purchase of a digital product grants a license of the product on Steam." It remains to be seen if the digital stores for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo will be updated as well with similar language.</p>

            <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is reportedly aiming for a Christmas release window.</p>
<p>That's coming from Khary Payton, who plays Marvel hero Black Panther in the upcoming game. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a> about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's release window, Payton said: "We're still working. We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited."</p>
<p>So, perhaps this year it will be less about Santa Claus, and more about Marvel claws instead?</p>

<p>"I still can't believe that it's happening," the Black Panther actor continued. "But it's going to be so good. Amy Hennig, who did the Uncharted series, was the director and writer of the series. She is just so amazing and I'm like, 'man, we couldn't have asked for a better head of this project'.</p>
<p>"So I know it's taken a while, but trust me, it is going to be worth it."</p>

<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-teaser-trailer-for-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">first teaser for Hennig's then-unnamed Marvel game back in 2022</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-creative-director-amy-hennig-is-working-on-a-new-marvel-game">its announcement back in 2021</a>. Since then, we have been offered a few more smallish snippets, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's take on Wakanda</a>, as well as a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> which gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," Hennig previously said about the game.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Now, I just wonder when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine will get a release date</a>…?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The closest I came to playing Glover before 2025 was back when I worked at CEX. There was a copy of the game just sat on the shelf for years and years while i worked there, nobody ever being tempted to buy it before I left. It might even be there to this day! It’s a game that came in that first wave of 3D platformers, with the twist that you’re a magical glove that handles balls.&nbsp;Bouncy, bowling, and metal balls, that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="Glover (QUByte Classics) | Launch Trailer - Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox One/Series S|X" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEUrhw0V8YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Glover sees a spell go wrong with a wizard falling out of a tower, getting himself frozen in place. Not his gloves, though. Glover sets off on a mission to retrieve the crystals to restore things back to normal, while his opposite number has nefarious plans to stop Glover. It’s a simple set up, and before long you’re rolling around different stages, attempting to roll back the crystals to the cave where the wizard waits.</p>


<p>These magical crystals can change into a bouncy ball, a bowling ball, and a metal ball, with Glover having the power to transform them at any time to meet different challenges. The bouncy ball will float on water, for example, whereas the others will sink to the bottom and can be rolled along. The balls can also be slapped, bounced, and thrown, allowing you to get around. When throwing there is a line that shows you where it will land, but when slapping them there is little true idea of where the ball will end up, which isn’t great when you’re trying to beat a boss.</p>
<p>The game is divided into six stages, each made up of multiple levels. The goal is to navigate these levels with the ball, passing the challenges and defeating the bosses.</p>


<p>From the start Glover is not a fun experience. The levels are barren, the balls can be unwieldy, and movement can be frustrating. This is most evident when you’re trying to float the ball across water while running on top of it to get it to move. The directional input inverts when this happens and it can take a lot of time to get the ball out of the water.</p>
<p>Most of your time will be spent fighting the ball and the controls, instead of navigating the level. The camera is unwieldy – as was tradition at the time and hasn’t been fixed for the remaster – sometimes zooming right up to Glover so you can’t see the level around you. Bosses are also fairly uninspired, and paired with these controls and movement, utterly frustrating to fight. In one boss fight, I also encountered a bug where Glover would start running in mid-air, and not grab the ball properly. Whether this is a new remastered bug, or an old one, I’m not sure, but it shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>At least the music is pretty catchy.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even in its remastered form, Glover is really frustrating to play, and not an enjoyable experience at all. With the amount of games out there and the limited amount of time most of us have, you would be better off getting something else, unless you really want a nostalgic trip to experience a rather bland re-release of a 3D platformer.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could bring back the dual-screen experience of previous Nintendo consoles like the DS and 3DS, judging from a recently discovered accessory patent.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-phone-holder-attachment-magnetic-tech-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameRant,</a> Nintendo recently patented a sort of connection structure that can rotate around a magnetic connection point. The patent explicitly mentions a smartphone holder as one of the accessories that could be compatible with this design, suggesting that the company is at least considering bringing back a dual-screen experience in some form. Even if this accessory wouldn't have any actual in-game application, it could still be somewhat useful for those who, for example, want to have game guides quickly available while playing games. Still, as Nintendo files a lot of patents that never get turned into actual products, there's no way to know if the Japanese company will indeed bring back the dual-screen experiences that worked quite well with the DS and 3DS, but not so much with the Wii U.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-anticipated reveal&nbsp;<span>in January, very little has been said about the Nintendo Switch 2. Some new images shared last month provided a new look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dock</a>&nbsp;and the console's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charger</a>, but it's becoming clearer than ever that the most important information on the system will only come during the Nintendo Direct, which</span>&nbsp;will air on April 2nd.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches sometime this year worldwide.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> A June release is likely</a>, according to a former Nintendo employee.</p>

            <p>
It's been a lifetime since I read George Orwell's 1984 - a tale of mass surveillance, indoctrination and repression nowadays invoked to describe everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernPropaganda/comments/wjgi4z/living_in_1984_political_cartoon_by_gary_varvel/">Trump's Twitter ban</a> to Pizza Express telling you that jelly-beans aren't a topping - but I will always remember how it combined role-playing with adventure gaming and brought the "detail of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> into the real-time world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>". Oh, forgive me, I'm actually remembering Big Brother, a video game sequel to Orwell's book, which I have never played, because it never made it to shelves. 
</p>
<p>
Online sleuths have just dug up and published an ancient E3 demo for this mysterious game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/BigBrother19990401">Here it be</a>, and here be some footage for any unpersons concerned that downloading the files might get them shipped off to a joycamp by thinkpol.

<p>
As passed on by <a href="https://x.com/LostMediaBuster/status/1743689006276092050">the Lost Media Busters</a>, Big Brother was in development at American company MediaX (the originators of the Riven/Quake marketing line) in the late 1990s. Announced in May 1998, it won awards at trade shows and was in the final stages of production as of September 1999, but then appears to have met with financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The developers somehow lost the rights to the title, with rights holder Newspeak (argh) subsequently approaching other publishers to pick up the near-finished game. <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Big_Brother_(found_build_of_cancelled_PC_game_based_on_%22Nineteen_Eighty-Four%22_novel;_1998)">Lost Media Wiki</a> users have tried to contact MediaX founder Matt MacLaurin and former art director Mark Gilster to verify all this, to no avail. Maybe Miniluv got to them.
</p>
<p>
The wizened gurus of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/a-demo-of-a-lost-pc-game-based-on-george-orwells-1984-has-been-archived-online">Time Extension</a> have a summary of Big Brother's plot. The game would have swapped the book's protagonist Winston Smith for a new character, Eric Blair - this being George Orwell's real name. Eric's goal was to rescue his fiancee by helping revolutionaries bring down the Thought Police. And completing environmental puzzles. It was broken into 12 levels designed to last five hours apiece.</p>
<p>It all sounds fairly, well, videogamey, next to the book's scenes of state-engineered psychosis and inward torture. The mission briefing in the video puts me in mind of G-Police, which I guess had its Orwellian moments. Still, it seems a lot more considered than the typical 1990s licensed adaptation process of Virgin Interactive executives doing lines of cheezewiz and yelling "BUT WHAT IF LITTLE DORRIT HAD DINOSAURS".
</p>
<p>
MediaX were a colourful bunch, inasmuch as I can extract their DNA from the internet's swamp of malreporting and doublethink. Time Extension credit them as the creators of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/18997/queensryches-promised-land/">Queensrÿche's Promised Land</a>, in which you reassemble a totem at the behest of a prog rock band, and On the Road With BB King, an interactive biography of a famous blues guitarist. Slightly reminiscent of Troy McClure's back catalogue, perhaps, but I like the range.
</p>
<p>
There have been many Orwellian video games in the years since MediaX's Big Brother slipped under the carpet. I quite enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orwells-animal-farm">Orwell's Animal Farm</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> developers Nerial. Thanks to googling for hints about MediaX's long-gone project, I've also just learned about<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390780/1984/"> a forthcoming 1984 adaptation</a> from Tom Jubert, the narrative designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, Talos Principle and FTL. It's described as "part walking simulator, part adventure, and part survival game", and is about gathering the means for rebellion while keeping up your day job, with actions "largely narrated from Orwell's original prose".

There’s a specific Great Axe obtainable at the very end of the game that would likely take the top spot overall, but given that you have less than an hour of playtime left when you reach that point, it’s a rather disappointing find. As such, your best bet is to grab the mighty Seven Strivings Great Axe early in the game, and keep it upgraded throughout your adventure instead. Here’s what to know and where to find it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1566653"><a id=""></a><strong>Seven Strivings passive bonus and enchantments</strong></h2><p>Seven Strivings comes with the Vicious Strikes passive bonus, which increases your critical strike chance by five percent. This may not seem like a particularly meaningful increase, but any improvement to critical strike chance is a win, especially against tougher foes you’ll be wailing on for a while.</p><p>Seven Strivings comes with the Determined Step enchantment, which grants you +15 percent movement speed for 10 seconds after defeating an enemy.
